We also refer to trademarks of other corporations and organizations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n34\nTable of \nContents\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and affect our financial results. You should carefully consider all of the information in this report and, in particular, the following principal risks and all of the other specific factors described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this report before deciding whether to invest in our company.\n•\nWe depend heavily on JAKAFI/JAKAVI (ruxolitinib), and if we are not able to maintain revenues from JAKAFI/JAKAVI or those revenues decrease, our business may be materially harmed.\n•\nIf we or our collaborators are unable to obtain, or maintain at anticipated levels, coverage and reimbursement for our products from government and other third-party payors, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\n•\nA limited number of specialty pharmacies and wholesalers represent a significant portion of revenues from JAKAFI and most of our other products, and the loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any one of these specialty pharmacies or wholesalers could harm our operations and financial condition.\n•\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products.\n•\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could lose our approval to market our products or be subject to other governmental enforcement activity.\n•\nIf the use of our products harms or is perceived to harm patients, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted or we could be subject to costly product liability claims.\n•\nIf we market our products in a manner that violates various laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\n•\nCompetition for our products could harm our business and result in a decrease in our revenue.\n•\nWe or our collaborators may be unsuccessful in discovering and developing drug candidates, and we may spend significant time and money attempting to do so, in particular with our later stage drug candidates.\n•\nIf we or our collaborators are unable to obtain regulatory approval in and outside of the United States for drug candidates, we and our collaborators will be unable to commercialize those drug candidates.\n•\nHealth care reform measures could impact the pricing and profitability of pharmaceuticals, and adversely affect the commercial viability of our or our collaborators’ products and drug candidates. \n•\nConflicts between us and our collaborators or termination of our collaboration agreements could limit future development and commercialization of our drug candidates and harm our business.\n•\nIf we are unable to establish collaborations to fully exploit our drug discovery and development capabilities or if future collaborations are unsuccessful, our future revenue prospects could be diminished.\n•\nIf we fail to enter into additional in-licensing agreements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, we may be unable to increase our number of successfully marketed products and our revenues.\n•\nBusiness disruptions, including those resulting from public health pandemics, natural disasters, and other geopolitical events, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n•\nEven if one of our drug candidates receives regulatory approval, we may determine that commercialization would not be worth the investment.\n•\nWe have limited capacity to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials, and our resulting dependence on other parties could result in delays in and additional costs for our drug development efforts.\n•\nOur reliance on others to manufacture our drug products and drug candidates could result in drug supply constraints, delays in clinical trials, increased costs, and withdrawal or denial of regulatory approvals.\n35\nTable of \nContents\n•\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business.\n•\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or unfit versions of our or our collaborators’ products or stolen products could harm our business and reputation.\n•\nAs most of our drug discovery and development operations are conducted at our headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the loss of access to this facility would negatively impact our business.\n•\nIf we lose any of our key employees or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, our business and ability to achieve our objectives could be harmed.\n•\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our ability to develop and commercialize products could suffer.\n•\nWe may acquire businesses or assets, form joint ventures or make investments in other companies that may be unsuccessful, divert our management’s attention and harm our operating results and prospects.\n•\nRisks associated with our operations outside of the United States could adversely affect our business.\n•\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products, and our results of operations could be harmed.\n•\nBecause our activities involve the use of hazardous materials, we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials that could be time consuming and costly.\n•\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses to discover and develop drugs, which could result in future losses and impair our achievement of and ability to sustain profitability in the future.\n•\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in the future when we require it, our efforts to broaden our product portfolio or commercialization efforts could be limited.\n•\nOur marketable securities and equity investments are subject to risks that could adversely affect our overall financial position, and tax law changes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n•\nIf we are unable to achieve milestones, develop product candidates to license or renew or enter into new collaborations, our royalty and milestone revenues and future prospects for those revenues may decrease.\n•\nAny arbitration or litigation involving us and regarding intellectual property infringement claims could be costly and disrupt our drug discovery and development efforts.\n•\nOur inability to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary information may result in loss of revenues or otherwise reduce our ability to compete.\n•\nIf the effective term of our patents is decreased or if we need to refile some of our patent applications, the value of our patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased.\n•\nInternational patent protection is particularly uncertain and costly, and our involvement in opposition proceedings may result in the expenditure of substantial sums and management resources.\n•\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems, breaches of data security, or unauthorized disclosures of sensitive data could harm our business and subject us to liability or reputational damage. \n•\nIncreasing use of social media and new technology could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputational damage, which could harm our business and results of operations.\n36\nTable of \nContents\nOverview\nIncyte is a global biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics. Our global headquarters is located in Wilmington, Delaware, where we conduct discovery, clinical development and commercial operations. We also conduct clinical development and commercial operations from our European headquarters in Morges, Switzerland and our other offices across Europe, as well as our Japanese office in Tokyo and our Canadian headquarters in Montreal.\nWe are focused in two therapeutic areas that are defined by the indications of our approved medicines and the diseases for which our clinical candidates are being developed. One therapeutic area is Hematology/Oncology, which comprises Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (“MPNs”), Graft-Versus-Host Disease (“GVHD”), solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. The other therapeutic area is Inflammation and Autoimmunity (“IAI”), which includes our Dermatology franchise. We are also eligible to receive milestones and royalties on molecules discovered by us and licensed to third parties. \nHematology and Oncology\nOur hematology and oncology franchise comprises six approved products, which are JAKAFI (ruxolitinib), MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix)/MINJUVI (tafasitamab), PEMAZYRE (pemigatinib), ICLUSIG (ponatinib), ZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr), and NIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr), as well as numerous clinical development programs. \nApproved Products\nJAKAFI (ruxolitinib)\nJAKAFI (ruxolitinib) is our first product to be approved for sale in the United States. JAKAFI is the most advanced compound in our janus associated kinase (“JAK”) program and is an oral JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in November 2011 for the treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (“MF”); in December 2014 for the treatment of adults with polycythemia vera (“PV”) who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea; in May 2019 \nfor the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older; and in September 2021 for the treatment of chronic GVHD after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older\n. MF and PV are both MPNs, a group of rare blood cancers, and GVHD is an adverse immune response to an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Under our collaboration agreement with our collaboration partner Novartis Pharmaceutical International Ltd. (“Novartis”), Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib outside of the United States for all hematologic and oncologic indications and sells ruxolitinib outside of the United States under the name JAKAVI.\nJAKAFI was the first FDA-approved JAK inhibitor for any indication, was the first FDA-approved product in MF, PV and steroid-refractory acute GVHD, and was recently approved in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. JAKAFI remains the first-line standard of care in MF and remains the only FDA-approved product for steroid-refractory acute GVHD. The FDA has granted JAKAFI orphan drug status for MF, PV and GVHD. In addition, ruxolitinib phosphate qualifies for the Small Biotech Exception from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) under the Inflation Reduction Act.\nJAKAFI is distributed primarily through a network of specialty pharmacy providers and wholesalers that allow for efficient delivery of the medication by mail directly to patients or direct delivery to the patient's pharmacy. Our distribution process uses a model that is well established and familiar to physicians who practice within the oncology field.\nWe have retained all development and commercialization rights to JAKAFI in the United States and are eligible to receive development and sales milestones as well as royalties from product sales outside the United States. We hold patents that cover the composition of matter and use of ruxolitinib and its salt. These patents, including applicable extensions, currently expire in mid and late 2028. In December 2022, we were granted pediatric exclusivity, which adds six months to the expiration for all ruxolitinib patents listed in FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) as of the date of the grant of pediatric exclusivity.\n37\nTable of \nContents\nMONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix) / MINJUVI (tafasitamab)\nIn January 2020, we and MorphoSys AG (“MorphoSys”) entered into a collaboration and license agreement to further develop and commercialize MorphoSys’ proprietary anti-CD19 antibody tafasitamab (MOR208), an Fc-engineered antibody against CD19. Under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement, we received rights to co-commercialize tafasitamab in the United States with MorphoSys, and exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States. As more fully described in Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement with MorphoSys, and as a result, we now hold exclusive global rights for tafasitamab, and the collaboration and license agreement was terminated.\nIn July 2020, the FDA approved MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix), in combination with lenalidomide, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (“r/r”) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”). In August 2021, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for MINJUVI (tafasitamab), in combination with lenalidomide, followed by MINJUVI monotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT.\n In June 2025, MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with r/r follicular lymphoma (“FL”) in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide. \nPEMAZYRE (pemigatinib)\nPEMAZYRE is the first internally discovered product to be internationally commercialized by us.\nIn April 2020, the FDA approved PEMAZYRE (pemigatinib), a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. PEMAZYRE is the first FDA-approved treatment for this indication, which was approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. \nIn March 2021, PEMAZYRE was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”) for the treatment of patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer with an FGFR2 fusion gene, worsening after cancer chemotherapy, and was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement that has progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. In July 2021, the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”) recommended PEMAZYRE for patients with cholangiocarcinoma with a FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. NICE’s guidance enables all eligible patients in England and Wales to have access to PEMAZYRE through the National Health Service. In March 2022, PEMAZYRE was approved by the National Medical Products Administration of the People’s Republic of China for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement as confirmed by a validated diagnostic test that has progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. \nIn August 2022, PEMAZYRE was approved by the FDA as the first and only targeted treatment for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (“MLNs”) with FGFR1 rearrangement. In March 2023, PEMAZYRE was approved by the MHLW for the treatment of MLNs with FGFR1 fusion.\nICLUSIG (ponatinib)\nIn June 2016, we acquired the European operations of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and obtained an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ICLUSIG (ponatinib), a kinase inhibitor, in Europe and other select countries. The primary target for ICLUSIG is BCR-ABL, an abnormal tyrosine kinase that is expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”) and Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“Ph+ ALL”).\nIn the European Union, ICLUSIG is approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase or blast phase CML who are resistant to dasatinib or nilotinib, who are intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation, or the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ ALL who are resistant to dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation. \n38\nTable of \nContents\nZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr)\nIn October 2017, we and MacroGenics, Inc. (“MacroGenics”), announced an exclusive global collaboration and license agreement for MacroGenics’ retifanlimab (formerly INCMGA0012), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Under this collaboration, we obtained exclusive worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of retifanlimab in all indications. \nIn March 2023, the FDA approved ZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr) under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (“MCC”). In April 2024, the European Commission approved ZYNYZ (retifanlimab) as a monotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy.\nIn May 2025, the FDA approved ZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced squamous cell anal cancer (“SCAC”) in combination with chemotherapy and as a single agent. We have submitted a Type II variation Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and a Japanese New Drug Application for retifanlimab in advanced SCAC.\nNIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr)\nIn September 2021, we and Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced an exclusive worldwide collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize axatilimab, Syndax’s anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. \nIn August 2024, the FDA approved NIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr) for the treatment of chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients. NIKTIMVO is the first approved anti-CSF-1R antibody targeting the drivers of inflammation and fibrosis seen in chronic GVHD. The U.S. commercial launch of NIKTIMVO commenced in January 2025. Also in January 2025, the FDA approved two smaller vial sizes (9mg and 22mg) of NIKTIMVO to facilitate patient dosing and limit product waste. \nClinical Programs in Hematology and Oncology\nRuxolitinib XR\nWe are developing a once-a-day formulation of ruxolitinib for potential use as monotherapy and in combinations. Bioavailability and bioequivalence data were published for ruxolitinib’s once-daily (“QD”) extended release (“XR”) formulation at the European Hematology Association (“EHA”) Virtual Congress in June 2021. In March 2023, the FDA issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) for ruxolitinib XR tablets for QD use in the treatment of certain types of MF, PV and GVHD. In December 2023, we\n received FDA feedback and agreed on the requirements to address the CRL. In early 2025, we announced that a bioequivalence study of ruxolitinib XR was completed and met the bioequivalence criteria set by the FDA. These data are anticipated to be submitted to the FDA, in response to the CRL, by year-end 2025. \nINCB57643 (BET inhibitor)\nINCB057643 is a small-molecule inhibitor of BET that was being evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with advanced malignancies. In October 2025, development for INCB57643 was discontinued.\nINCA033989 (mutCALR)\nIn June 2025, data from our Phase 1 study evaluating INCA033989, an Incyte-discovered, investigational novel anti-mutant calreticulin (“CALR”)-targeted monoclonal antibody,\n \nin mutCALR positive patients with essential thrombocythemia were presented during a late-breaking session at the 2025 EHA Congress in Milan, Italy. The data showed rapid and durable normalization of platelet counts across all dose levels and importantly, a reduction in peripheral blood mutCALR variant allele frequency correlating with hematologic response. INCA033989 was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile with no dose limiting toxicities reported. Together, the data demonstrates the potential for INCA033989 to modify disease by directly inhibiting and eliminating oncogenic mutCALR cells, while sparing healthy cells and restoring normal blood cell production. \nThe Phase 1 data in patients with MF as monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib are anticipated in the second half of 2025.\n39\nTable of \nContents\nIn October 2025, we announced a strategic partnership with Enable Injections, Inc. (“Enable”) to develop and commercialize specific assets in our portfolio, including INCA033989, with Enable’s enFuse\n®\n on-body delivery system. Under the terms of the agreement, we will obtain a worldwide, exclusive license to use the enFuse technology with INCA033989 in essential thrombocythemia and MF, with the potential to expand to additional assets and indications.\nOther Clinical Programs\nINCB160058 (JAK2V617Fi)\nWe initiated a Phase 1 study of INCB160058, an Incyte-discovered, investigational novel potent and selective JAK2 pseudokinase domain binder with potential to be a disease modifying therapeutic, in the first quarter of 2024. In preclinical studies, INCB160058 inhibited cytokine independent activity of JAK2V617F while sparing WT JAK2.\nTafasitamab\n \nTafasitamab is an anti-CD19 antibody and is being investigated as a therapeutic option in B cell malignancies in a number of ongoing and planned combination trials. The open-label Phase 2 combination trial (L-MIND) is investigating the safety and efficacy of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in patients with r/r DLBCL and the ongoing Phase 3 B-MIND trial is assessing the combination of tafasitamab and bendamustine versus rituximab and bendamustine in r/r DLBCL. firstMIND is a Phase 1b safety trial of tafasitamab as a first-line therapy for patients with DLBCL, and frontMIND is an ongoing placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial evaluating tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide added to rituximab plus chemotherapy as a first-line therapy for patients with DLBCL.\nRetifanlimab\nWe are conducting two Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating retifanlimab, \na humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1,\n in SCAC and non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). POD1UM-303/InterAACT2 is a Phase 3, global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluating carboplatin-paclitaxel with retifanlimab or placebo in patients with inoperable locally recurrent or metastatic SCAC who have not previously been treated with chemotherapy. POD1UM-304 is a Phase 3, global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluating platinum-based chemotherapy with retifanlimab or placebo in patients with first-line, metastatic squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC. \nIn July 2024, we announced that both trials met their respective primary endpoints. In September 2024, we presented late-breaking Phase 3 results showing that  the Phase 3 POD1UM-303/InterAACT2 trial for retifanlimab met the primary endpoint of progression free survival and demonstrated improvement across key secondary endpoints in patients with SCAC receiving retifanlimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel). \nINCB123667 (CDK2)\n INCB123667 is a novel, potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of serine threonine kinase (“CDK2”) which has been shown to suppress tumor growth as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care, in Cyclin E amplified tumor models, in vivo. We are evaluating INCB123667 in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced malignancies including CCNE1 high TNBC and HR+HER2- tumors post-CDK4/6 inhibitors.\nIn September 2024, we presented initial data from the Phase 1 CDK2 inhibitor program at the 2024 European Society of Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress. Phase 1 data of INCB123667 were presented demonstrating single-agent antitumor activity across a range of doses and regimens, notably in patients with ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer whose tumors overexpress Cyclin E1. The Phase 1 trial is ongoing with INCB123667 in combination with other agents. In September 2025, a Phase 2 single-arm study of INCB123667 (CDK2i) in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) with Cyclin E1 overexpression was initiated. A Phase 3, randomized, open-label study of INCB123667 versus investigator’s choice chemotherapy in patients with PROC with Cyclin E1 overexpression is planned to initiate by year-end 2025. \n40\nTable of \nContents\nSelect Earlier-Stage Development Programs in Hematology and Oncology\nINCB161734 (KRAS G12D)\nINCB161734 is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable KRAS G12D inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor with \nKRASG12D\n mutation. In October 2025, preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 1 study were presented at the 2025 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. In the study, INCB161734 demonstrated a manageable safety profile and clinical efficacy in heavily pretreated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with a KRASG12D mutation. Based upon these results, we intend to continue further development of INCB161734.\nINCA33890 (TGFβR2xPD-1)\nINCA33890 is a TGFβR2xPD-1 bispecific antibody that has been engineered to avoid the known toxicity of broad TGFβ pathway blockade. INCA33890 has a 10-fold higher binding affinity for PD-1 relative to TGFβR2, and specifically blocks TGFβ signaling in cells co-expressing PD-1. In July 2023, we initiated a Phase 1 study evaluating INCA33890 in patients with select advanced/metastatic solid tumors.  In October 2025, data from the ongoing Phase 1 study evaluating were presented at the 2025 ESMO Congress. In the study, INCA33890\n demonstrated clinical efficacy across multiple tumors, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) in patients with and without active liver metastases.  INCA33890 was generally well tolerated and evaluation of INCA33890 in combination with standard of care (SoC) treatments in patients with metastatic CRC is ongoing. Based on these initial findings, we plan to initiate a registrational program evaluating INCA33890 in MSS CRC in 2026.\nInflammation and AutoImmunity\nIncyte Dermatology launched its first approved product, OPZELURA (ruxolitinib) cream, in October 2021. OPZELURA subsequently was approved by the FDA and European Commission for vitiligo in July 2022 and April 2023, respectively. Our IAI efforts also include numerous clinical development programs. \nOPZELURA (ruxolitinib) cream\nAtopic Dermatitis\n. In September 2021, the FDA approved OPZELURA (ruxolitinib) cream, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (“AD”) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. AD is a skin disorder that causes long term inflammation of the skin resulting in itchy, red, swollen and cracked skin. \nIn September 2025, the FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) for OPZELURA for the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate AD in non-immunocompromised children two years of age and older whose disease is not well controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not recommended. \nVitiligo. \nIn July 2022, the FDA approved OPZELURA for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. OPZELURA was approved for continuous use and no limits to duration as a treatment for nonsegmental vitiligo. Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune depigmenting skin disease characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. OPZELURA is the first and only FDA approved treatment for repigmentation of vitiligo lesions.\nIn April 2023, the European Commission approved OPZELURA for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents 12 years and older following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). In October 2024, OPZELURA cream 1.5% was granted a Notice of Compliance by Health Canada for the topical treatment of both mild to moderate AD and nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older. \n41\nTable of \nContents\nClinical Programs in Dermatology\nRuxolitinib cream\nRuxolitinib cream is a potent, selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that provides the opportunity to directly target diverse pathogenic pathways that underlie certain dermatologic conditions, including pediatric AD, vitiligo, hidradenitis suppurativa (“HS”) and prurigo nodularis (“PN”).\nAtopic Dermatitis. \nIn July 2025, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 (TRuE-AD4) study evaluating ruxolitinib cream in adult patients with moderate atopic dermatitis. The study met the co-primary endpoints at Week 8, with a statistically significant proportion of patients achieving both Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success and EASI75, which is defined as a 75% or greater improvement in the Eczema Area Severity Index score from baseline. In addition, the study met all key secondary endpoints. Ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated with no new safety signals.\nHidradenitis Suppurativa. \nIn January 2024, we announced positive topline results from a randomized controlled Phase 2 study evaluating ruxolitinib cream in HS. Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream twice daily met the primary efficacy endpoint as measured by a change from baseline in abscess and nodule count at Week 16 versus placebo in patients with mild to moderate HS. Ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated and consistent with its known safety profile. In June 2025, two Phase 3 studies (TRuE-HS2 and TRuE-HS2) evaluating ruxolitinib cream in mild to moderate HS were initiated. \nPrurigo Nodularis. \nIn March 2025, results from two Phase 3 studies (TRuE-PN1 and TRuE-PN2) evaluating ruxolitinib cream in patients with PN were presented in a late-breaking oral session at the American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting. The TRuE-PN1 study met the primary endpoint of a > 4-point improvement from baseline in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale at Week 12 and all key secondary endpoints. The TRuE-PN2 study did not reach statistical significance for the primary endpoint, resulting in the key secondary endpoints with nominal p-values. These key secondary endpoints still demonstrate positive trends for ruxolitinib cream 1.5% versus vehicle. These data will inform planned discussions with regulatory authorities on submission.\nPovorcitinib\nWe also are developing povorcitinib, which is an oral small molecule selective JAK1 inhibitor. Povorcitinib is undergoing evaluation in patients with HS, nonsegmental vitiligo, PN, asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria (“CSU”). \nHidradenitis Suppurativa. \n HS is a chronic skin condition where lesions develop as a result of inflammation and infection of the sweat glands. In March 2025, positive results from two Phase 3 studies (STOP-HS1 and STOP-HS2) evaluating povorcitinib in patients with HS were presented and demonstrated that both studies met their primary endpoint of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12 and at both tested doses (45mg and 75mg). In addition, at Week 12, patients treated with povorcitinib achieved deep levels of clinical response with a greater proportion achieving HiSCR75, reduction in flares, >3-point decrease in the Skin Pain NRS score and Skin Pain NRS30. Furthermore, povorcitinib demonstrated rapid onset of response, including rapid skin pain reduction. \nIn September 2025, additional data from the STOP-HS1 and STOP-HS2 studies were presented at the European Association of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Annual Meeting. In the studies, povorcitinib demonstrated sustained improvements in symptoms for patients with active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) through 24 weeks. These data support the planned regulatory submissions of povorcitinib for the treatment of HS in 2025 and 2026.\nNonsegmental Vitiligo. \nIn March and October 2023, we presented results from the Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating povorcitinib in patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo which demonstrated that treatment with oral povorcitinib was associated with substantial total body and facial repigmentation, as measured by total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index.\nPrurigo Nodularis. \nIn October 2023, we announced that the Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study evaluating the efficacy and safety of povorcitinib\n \nin participants with PN had met its primary endpoint.\n \nIn October 2024, following the positive Phase 2 results, two \nPhase 3 studies in patients with PN were initiated. \n42\nTable of \nContents\nAsthma and Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU).\n \nIn July 2023, we initiated a Phase 2 trial evaluating povorcitinib in patients with moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma. Data from this proof-of-concept study is anticipated in 2026.\nIn April 2025, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 2 study evaluating povorcitinib in patients with CSU. The study met the primary endpoint at Week 12 of change from baseline in the Urticaria Activity Score summed over 7 days. Povorcitinib was well tolerated with no new safety signals observed. In October 2025, we decided not to pursue further development of povorcitinib in CSU to prioritize other programs.  \nOther Clinical Programs\nINCA034460 (anti-CD122)\nIn November 2022, we acquired Villaris Therapeutics, Inc., an asset-centric biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel antibody therapeutics for vitiligo. INCA034460 is a novel, humanized anti-IL-15Rβ monoclonal antibody designed to target and deplete autoreactive tissue resident memory T cells that has demonstrated efficacy as a treatment for vitiligo in preclinical model\ns. In October 2025, we paused further development of INCA034460.\nINCB00928 (zilurgisertib)\nIn May 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 trial evaluating zilurgisertib (INCB00928) in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (“FOP”), a disorder in which muscle tissue and connective tissue are gradually replaced by bone. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation and orphan drug designation to zilurgisertib as a treatment for patients with FOP.\nCollaborative Partnered Programs\nAs described below under “License Agreements and Business Relationships,” we are eligible for milestone payments and royalties on certain products that we licensed to third parties. These include OLUMIANT (baricitinib), which is licensed to our collaborative partner Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), and JAKAVI (ruxolitinib) and TABRECTA (capmatinib), which are licensed to Novartis. \nBaricitinib\nWe have a second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, which is subject to our collaboration agreement with Lilly, in which Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to the compound for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. \nRheumatoid Arthritis.\n In February 2017, the European Commission approved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to, one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In July 2017, the MHLW granted marketing approval for OLUMIANT\n \nfor the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (including the prevention of structural injury of joints) in patients with inadequate response to standard-of-care therapies. In June 2018, the FDA approved the 2mg dose of OLUMIANT for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies.\nAtopic Dermatitis. \nLilly has conducted a Phase 2a trial and a Phase 3 program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In October 2020, the European Commission approved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. In December 2020, baricitinib was approved by the MHLW for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AD. \nAlopecia Areata\n. In June 2022, the FDA approved 2mg, and 4mg doses of OLUMIANT for the treatment of adults with severe alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the hair follicles causing hair loss in patches, becoming the first and only systemic treatment in the indication. In June 2022, OLUMIANT was approved as a treatment for alopecia areata in Europe and Japan.\n43\nTable of \nContents\nCOVID-19.\n In May 2020, we amended our agreement with Lilly to enable Lilly to commercialize baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA’s Emergence Use Authorization provides for the use of baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (“ECMO”).  In June 2022, the FDA approved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO.\nType 1 Diabetes\n. In October 2025, we amended our agreement with Lilly to enable Lilly to commercialize baricitinib for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus.\nCapmatinib\nCapmatinib is a potent and highly selective mesenchymal-epithelial-transition factor gene (“MET”) inhibitor. The investigational compound has demonstrated inhibitory activity in cell-based biochemical and functional assays that measure MET signaling and MET dependent cell proliferation, survival and migration. Under our agreement, Novartis received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications. Capmatinib is being evaluated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, NSCLC and other solid tumors, and may have potential utility as a combination agent.\nIn May 2020, the FDA approved capmatinib as TABRECTA for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 (“METex14”) skipping as detected by an FDA-approved test. TABRECTA is the first and only treatment approved to specifically target NSCLC with this driver mutation and is approved for first-line and previously treated patients regardless of prior treatment type. \nIn June 2020, the MHLW approved TABRECTA for METex14 mutation-positive advanced and/or recurrent unresectable NSCLC. In April 2022, we and Novartis announced a positive opinion from the CHMP based on data from the Phase 2 GEOMETRY mono-1 study. In June 2022, the European Commission approved capmatinib as TABRECTA as a monotherapy treatment of adults with advanced NSCLC harboring alterations leading to METex14 skipping who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy.\nRuxolitinib\nGraft-versus-host disease.\n In March 2022, we and Novartis announced a positive opinion from the CHMP for ruxolitinib in acute and chronic GVHD, based on data from the Phase 3 REACH2 and REACH3 trials. In May 2022, the European Commission approved ruxolitinib as JAKAVI for the treatment of acute or chronic GVHD in patients aged 12 years and older who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies. \nIn August 2023, Novartis announced that JAKAVI had been approved in Japan for use in GVHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\nLicense Agreements and Business Relationships\nWe establish business relationships, including collaborative arrangements with other companies and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our drugs and drug candidates and to provide support for our research programs. We also evaluate opportunities for acquiring products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business from other companies and medical research institutions.\nBelow is a brief description of our significant business relationships and collaborations and related license agreements that expand our pipeline and provide us with certain rights to existing and potential new products and technologies. Additional information regarding our collaboration agreements, including their financial and accounting impact on our business and results of operations, can be found in Note 6 and Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n44\nTable of \nContents\nOut-License Agreements\nNovartis\nIn November 2009, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to ruxolitinib and certain back up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. We retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to JAKAFI (ruxolitinib) in the United States and in certain other indications. Novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our MET inhibitor compound capmatinib and certain back up compounds in all indications. We retained options to co-develop and to co-promote capmatinib in the United States. In April 2016, we amended this agreement to provide that Novartis has exclusive research, development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to ruxolitinib (excluding topical formulations) in the GVHD field.\nLilly\nIn December 2009, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Lilly. Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to baricitinib and certain back up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In March 2016, we entered into an amendment to the agreement with Lilly that allows us to engage in the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in the GVHD field. In May 2020, we amended our agreement with Lilly to enable Lilly to commercialize baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 and in October 2025, we further amended the agreement to enable Lilly to commercialize baricitinib for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. We will receive an upfront payment of $100.0 million in connection with the 2025 amendment, which amendment also restructured the royalty obligations on net sales of baricitinib, certain developmental and regulatory milestones associated with baricitinib, and the marketing and sales support obligations of Lilly. On baricitinib sales for any indication, we are now eligible to receive either a fixed royalty amount or tiered royalties based on a defined level of quarterly global net sales, with the tiered royalties up to a rate in the mid-teens. Additionally, for the treatment of COVID-19, we still receive a premium on royalties.\nIn-License Agreements\nMacroGenics\nIn October 2017, we entered into a Global Collaboration and License Agreement with MacroGenics. Under this agreement, we received exclusive development and commercialization rights worldwide to MacroGenics’ INCMGA0012, an investigational monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-1. MacroGenics has retained the right to develop and commercialize, at its cost and expense, its pipeline assets in combination with INCMGA0012. \nMerus\nIn December 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Merus. Under this agreement, which became effective in January 2017, the parties have agreed to collaborate with respect to the research, discovery and development of bispecific antibodies utilizing Merus’ technology platform. The collaboration encompasses up to ten independent programs. \nSyndax\nIn September 2021, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Syndax covering the worldwide development and commercialization of NIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr), Syndax’s anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. Under the terms of this agreement, we received exclusive commercialization rights to axatilimab outside of the United States, and co-commercialization rights in the United States.\n45\nTable of \nContents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Updates\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-09, “\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n.” This amended guidance applies to all entities and broadly aims to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and are applicable for disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning with the year ending December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU No. 2023-09 will have on our income tax disclosures and the method of adoption. ASU No. 2023-09 does not affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n (DISE).” This new guidance applies to all public entities and requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. Public entities must adopt the new standard prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2024-03 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn July 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-05, “\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets.\n” This amended guidance applies to all entities  and aims to simplify the estimation of expected credit losses for current accounts receivable and contract assets by providing a practical expedient for all companies and an accounting policy election for non-public companies. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025 and interim reporting periods within those annual periods. If electing the practical expedient or accounting policy election (if applicable), entities should apply the amendments in this update prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2025-05 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn September 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-06, “\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use (Subtopic 350-40): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Internal-Use Software.\n”\n \nThis amended guidance applies\n \nto all entities and serves to modernize the accounting for software costs that are accounted for under Subtopic 305-40, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (referred to as \"internal-use software\"). The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. Entities may adopt the new guidance using a prospective, modified, or retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2025-06 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n46\nTable of \nContents\nIn September 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-07, “\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Derivatives Scope Refinements and Scope Clarification for Share-Based Noncash Consideration from a Customer in a Revenue Contract.\n” This amended guidance applies to all entities and it refines the scope of derivative accounting and clarifies rules for share-based noncash consideration in revenue contracts. Specifically, this update is intended to address concerns about the application of derivative accounting to contracts that have features based on the operations or activities of one of the parties to the contract and to reduce diversity in the accounting for share-based payments in revenue contracts. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may adopt the new guidance prospectively, or on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2025-07 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nWe recorded net income of $424.2 million and basic net income per share of $2.17 and diluted net income per share of $2.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to net income of $106.5 million and basic net income per share of $0.55 and diluted net income per share of $0.54 in the corresponding period in 2024.

JAKAFI inventory levels were within normal range at the end of the third quarter of 2025.\nThe increase in OPZELURA net product revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2024 was primarily due to increased patient demand and refills in the U.S. in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. Additionally, $44.4 million of net product revenues during the third quarter of 2025 were from outside of the U.S., driven by continued uptake in France and Italy in vitiligo. OPZELURA inventory levels were within normal range at the end of the third quarter of 2025.\n47\nTable of \nContents\nNIKTIMVO net product revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 reflects continued strong uptake of the product following its commercial launch during the first quarter of 2025.\nThe increase in ZYNYZ net product revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by the approval of the product in squamous cell anal carcinoma in the second quarter of 2025. \nThe increase in total royalty revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2024 was primarily driven by growth in JAKAVI royalty revenue.\nOur product revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to our customers’ purchasing patterns over the course of the year, including as a result of increased inventory building by customers in advance of expected or announced price increases. Product revenues are recorded net of estimated product returns, pricing discounts including rebates offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and distribution fees and co-pay assistance. Our revenue recognition policies require estimates of the aforementioned sales allowances each period.\nThe following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\nDiscounts and \nDistribution\nFees\nCommercial & Government\nRebates and\nChargebacks\nCo-Pay\nAssistance\nand Other\nDiscounts\nProduct\nReturns\nTotal\nBalance at January 1, 2025\n$\n27,440 \n$\n382,558 \n$\n13,290 \n$\n23,013 \n$\n446,301 \nAllowances for current period sales\n161,452 \n1,187,599 \n113,106 \n17,323 \n1,479,480 \nAllowances for prior period sales\n(1,863)\n(9,224)\n46 \n(3,928)\n(14,969)\nCredits/payments for current period sales\n(125,985)\n(894,152)\n(108,721)\n(62)\n(1,128,920)\nCredits/payments for prior period sales\n(21,144)\n(137,935)\n(8,081)\n(7,539)\n(174,699)\nBalance at September 30, 2025\n$\n39,900 \n$\n528,846 \n$\n9,640 \n$\n28,807 \n$\n607,193 \nU.S. government rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our sales allowances. Increases in certain U.S. government reimbursement rates are limited to a measure of inflation, and when the price of a drug increases faster than this measure of inflation it will result in a penalty adjustment factor that causes a larger sales allowance to those government related entities. We expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of our gross product sales will continue to increase in connection with any future product price increases greater than the rate of inflation, and any such increase in these government rebates and chargebacks will have a negative impact on our reported product revenues, net. We adjust our estimates for government rebates and chargebacks based on new information regarding actual rebates as it becomes available.\nWe brought a lawsuit against the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) alleging that a regulation issued by CMS on the definition of “line extension” for purposes of the Medicaid rebate program is too broad and has the unintended consequence of treating OPZELURA as a “line extension” of JAKAFI under this program. We believe that such a reading would violate CMS’s statutory authority and be arbitrary and capricious given that OPZELURA, among other differentiators, is indicated to treat entirely different medical conditions and entirely different patient populations than JAKAFI. As of September 30, 2025, we have accrued approximately $188.9 million within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, relating to the incremental rebates that would be owed were OPZELURA considered a line extension of JAKAFI. The impact on OPZELURA gross to net deductions for the quarter ending September 30, 2025 is approximately 6.8%. If OPZELURA is not treated as a line extension of JAKAFI, this would result in a reversal of our accrual and a lower future gross to net deduction for OPZELURA.\n48\nTable of \nContents\nClaims by third-party payors for rebates and chargebacks are frequently submitted after the period in which the related sales occurred, which may result in adjustments to prior period accrual balances in the period in which the new information becomes available. Our company-sponsored patient savings program in which we provide financial assistance to enable commercially-insured patients to afford their insurance premium and co-pays may fluctuate as the commercial insurance landscape evolves and may impact net revenues, particularly for drugs like OPZELURA. We also adjust our allowance for product returns based on new information regarding actual returns as it becomes available. \nWe expect our sales allowances to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as changes in discount percentages which are impacted by potential future price increases, rate of inflation, and other factors. \nProduct royalty revenues on commercial sales of JAKAVI and TABRECTA by Novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by Novartis. Product royalty revenues on commercial sales of OLUMIANT by Lilly are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by Lilly.\nOur milestone and contract revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 were derived from a combination of upfront payments received from our third party collaborators for the transfer of functional intellectual property, as well as developmental milestones received from our third party collaborators.\nCost of Product Revenues \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\n(in millions)\nProduct costs\n$\n41.1 \n$\n38.2 \n$\n99.2 \n$\n96.8 \nSalary and benefits related\n5.0 \n2.6 \n15.3 \n7.2 \nStock compensation\n0.9 \n0.6 \n2.6 \n1.6 \nRoyalty expense\n30.8 \n38.5 \n90.4 \n100.5 \nProfit share\n14.3 \n— \n24.6 \n— \nAmortization of definite-lived intangible assets\n6.9 \n6.1 \n18.9 \n17.5 \nTotal cost of product revenues\n$\n99.0 \n$\n86.0 \n$\n251.0 \n$\n223.6 \nCost of product revenues includes all product related costs, reserves for obsolescence, employee personnel costs, including stock compensation, for those employees dedicated to the production of our commercial products, royalties and profit sharing under our collaborative agreements and amortization of our licensed intellectual property rights for ICLUSIG and capitalized milestone payments\n.\n The increase in cost of product revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024 was driven by growth in net product revenues, the NIKTIMVO profit share and increased manufacturing related costs, partially offset by the impact of the contract dispute settlement with Novartis.\nContract Dispute Settlement\nAs described further in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, during May 2025, we and Novartis entered into a settlement agreement with respect to litigation initiated by Novartis relating to the duration of royalty payments owed by us to Novartis under the our Collaboration and License Agreement. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $537.1 million of accrued royalties relating to the dispute with Novartis included in accrued and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Under the settlement agreement, we paid Novartis $280.0 million as the settlement of disputed royalties on net sales of JAKAFI in the United States through December 31, 2024, and agreed to reduce by 50% the royalty rate payable by us on future net sales of JAKAFI in the United States beginning January 1, 2025. The reduced royalty paid for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, was approximately $14.9 million. The difference of $242.2 million between the total accrued royalties and the total amount paid by us to Novartis as disclosed above was recorded in contract dispute settlement on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. \n49\nTable of \nContents\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\n(in millions)\nSalary and benefits related\n$\n146.9 \n$\n131.5 \n$\n410.9 \n$\n374.7 \nStock compensation\n39.7 \n45.8 \n114.1 \n117.1 \nEscient acquisition related compensation expense\n— \n— \n— \n11.3 \nEscient IPR&D expense\n— \n— \n— \n679.4 \nClinical research and outside services\n278.9 \n351.8 \n794.7 \n826.1 \nOccupancy and all other costs\n41.1 \n44.1 \n119.1 \n132.2 \nTotal research and development expenses\n$\n506.6 \n$\n573.2 \n$\n1,438.8 \n$\n2,140.8 \nWe account for research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. The increase in salary and benefits related expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding period in 2024 was due primarily to increased headcount to sustain our development pipeline. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. Additionally, as described in Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as part of the Escient acquisition, during the second quarter of 2024, we recognized compensation expense in research and development of $11.3 million associated with the accelerated vesting for certain Escient stock awards in connection with the acquisition on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nResearch and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also include the $679.4 million of expense related to the acquired in-process research and development assets as part of the Escient acquisition, as described in Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in clinical research and outside services expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, was primarily due to the $100.0 million milestone payment made to MacroGenics during the third quarter of 2024. Research and development expenses include upfront and milestone expenses related to our collaborative agreements of $0.1 million and $28.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Research and development expenses include upfront and milestone expenses related to our collaborative agreements of $100.0 million and $101.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were net of $4.3 million, $10.8 million, $3.8 million and $25.1 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners.\nIn addition to one-time expenses resulting from upfront fees in connection with the entry into any new or amended collaboration agreements and payment of milestones under those agreements, research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of preclinical and clinical trial related activities. Many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including requests by regulatory agencies for more information, inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among patients, insufficient supplies for our clinical trials, timing of drug supply, including API, and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials. In addition, the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. These factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products.\n50\nTable of \nContents\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\n(in millions)\nSalary and benefits related\n$\n105.4 \n$\n91.7 \n$\n297.4 \n$\n258.3 \nStock compensation\n21.0 \n31.5 \n70.5 \n75.6 \nEscient acquisition related compensation expense\n— \n— \n— \n20.2 \nOther contract services and outside costs\n202.7 \n186.0 \n617.9 \n561.3 \nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n329.1 \n$\n309.2 \n$\n985.8 \n$\n915.4 \nThe increase in salary and benefits related expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding period in 2024 was due primarily to increased headcount. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. Additionally, as described in Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as part of the Escient acquisition, during the second quarter of 2024, we recognized compensation expense in selling, general and administrative expenses of $20.2 million associated with the accelerated vesting for certain Escient stock awards in connection with the acquisition on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The increase in other contract services and outside costs for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, was primarily due to international marketing activities to support product launches.\n(Gain) loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration, which consists of our future royalty obligations to ARIAD/Takeda, was recorded on the acquisition date, June 1, 2016, at the estimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. The change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was a gain of $12.2 million and loss of $22.1 million, respectively, which is recorded in (gain) loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of $23.4 million and $23.8 million, respectively, which is recorded in (gain) loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was due  primarily to updated projections of future net revenues of Iclusig, including the impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and the passage of time.\nNon-operating Income and Expenses\nInterest income\nInterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $26.8 million and $74.8 million, respectively. Interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $19.3 million and $107.5 million, respectively. The increase in Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 is primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, and the decrease in Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 is primarily due to lower interest rates in 2025 and to a lesser extent, lower average cash balances as compared to the corresponding periods in 2024.\n51\nTable of \nContents\nGain (loss) on equity investments\nGains and losses on equity investments will fluctuate from period to period, based on sales of securities and the change in fair value of the securities we hold in our publicly held collaboration partners. The following table provides a summary of those gains (losses): \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\n(in millions)\nAgenus\n$\n— \n$\n(6.8)\n$\n— \n$\n(6.7)\nMerus\n— \n(4.1)\n— \n106.1 \nMorphoSys\n— \n— \n— \n30.7 \nSyndax\n8.6 \n(1.9)\n3.1 \n(3.4)\nOther\n— \n(0.2)\n— \n(0.5)\nTotal gain (loss) on equity investments\n$\n8.6 \n$\n(13.0)\n$\n3.1 \n$\n126.2 \nProvision for income taxes \nThe provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $58.1 million and $287.1 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $50.1 million and $171.5 million, respectively. \nOur effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a net decrease in our valuation allowance against certain U.S. federal deferred tax assets, resulting from the recently enacted U.S. tax law changes, as more fully described in Note 14 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance against certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. This was partially offset by tax rate benefits associated with research and development and orphan drug tax credit generations, the foreign derived intangible income deduction and a decrease in a prior year valuation allowance against certain U.S. federal deferred tax assets, resulting from the recently enacted U.S. tax law changes.\nOur effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign losses with no associated tax benefit (i.e., full valuation allowance) and an increase in our valuation allowance against certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. This was partially offset by tax rate benefits associated with research and development and orphan drug tax credit generations and the foreign derived intangible income deduction. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible charges of $710.9 million associated with the Escient acquisition. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt September 30, 2025, we had available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.9 billion. Our cash and marketable securities balances are primarily held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts and U.S. government debt securities. Available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy’s primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $870.2 million and net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $45.9 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the changes in net income as a result of the contract dispute settlement during the second quarter of 2025 and the Escient acquisition during the second quarter of 2024 and changes in working capital.\n52\nTable of \nContents\nOur investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales of long term investments. Net cash used in investing activities was $65.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which primarily represented purchases of marketable securities of $212.9 million, capital expenditures of $37.0 million and payments for intangible assets of $25.0 million, offset in part by maturities of marketable securities of $209.6 million. Net cash provided by investing activities was $179.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily represented sales of equity investments of $282.9 million and maturities of marketable securities of $207.9 million, offset in part by purchases of marketable securities of $229.0 million, capital expenditures of $68.9 million and payments for intangible assets of $13.9 million. In the future, net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments, acquisitions, and capital expenditures and maturities/sales and purchases of marketable securities.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $36.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily representing the $19.1 million paid for excise taxes relating to the June 2024 share repurchase, cash paid for tax withholdings related to restricted and performance share vesting and cash paid to ARIAD/Takeda for contingent consideration, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans. Net cash used in financing activities was $2.04 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily driven by expenditures associated with the share repurchase of $2.00 billion.\nIn August 2021, we entered into a $500.0 million, senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was subsequently amended in May 2023 and June 2024 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The June 2024 amendment to the Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from August 2024 to June 2027. We may increase the maximum revolving commitments or add one or more incremental term loan facilities, subject to obtaining commitments from any participating lenders and certain other conditions, in an amount not to exceed $250.0 million plus a contingent additional amount that is dependent on our pro forma consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. The Credit Agreement is described further in Note 17 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025 modified key provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The change related to the expensing of domestic research costs will materially reduce our U.S. tax liabilities in 2025 and 2026. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the modified provisions and have reflected an estimate in our financial statements for the period ending September 30, 2025.\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds available under our revolving credit facility, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; costs for future facility requirements; and expenditures for future strategic equity investments or potential acquisitions. We have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies or drug development candidates in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these licenses, we may be required to pay upfront fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products. These contingent future payments are discussed in detail in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTo the extent we seek to augment our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations to satisfy our cash requirements for future acquisitions or other strategic purposes, we expect that additional funding can be obtained through equity or debt financings or from other sources. The sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock. Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness."
