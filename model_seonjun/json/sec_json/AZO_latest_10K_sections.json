(“AutoZone,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a leading retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the Americas. We began operations in 1979 and at August 30, 2025, operated 6,627 stores in the United States (“U.S.”), 883 stores in Mexico and 147 stores in Brazil. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light duty trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. At August 30, 2025, in 6,098 of our domestic stores as well as the vast majority of our stores in Mexico and Brazil, we had a commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts and other products and commercial credit to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, fleet owners and other accounts. We also sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. Additionally, we sell the ALLDATA brand of automotive diagnostic, repair, collision and shop management software through www.alldata.com. We also provide product information on our Duralast branded products through www.duralastparts.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services. \nOur websites and the information contained therein or linked thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this report.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe the foundation of our success is our culture, which is deeply rooted in our Pledge and Values: Puts Customers First, Cares About People, Strives for Exceptional Performance, Energizes Others, Embraces Diversity and Helps Teams Succeed. Our Pledge and Values define how our employees (“AutoZoners”) take care of customers and fellow AutoZoners by fostering a strong, unique culture of teamwork and customer service. Each AutoZoner works hard to Live the Pledge, remain committed to our values, share their passion for WOW! Customer Service and Go the Extra Mile every day to continue building and growing AutoZone for our customers. \n​\nWe seek to be the employer of choice as we compete for talent in our retail stores, field supervision, distribution centers, and store support functions. We focus heavily on retention by offering competitive compensation and benefits packages, extensive training and development opportunities.\n​\nAs of August 30, 2025, we employed approximately 130,000 AutoZoners, approximately 60 percent of whom were employed full-time and the remaining 40 percent were employed part-time. Approximately 91 percent of our AutoZoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision, approximately six percent in distribution centers and approximately three percent in store support and other functions. Included in the above numbers are approximately 19,000 AutoZoners employed in our international operations. We have never experienced any material labor disruption, do not have any collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. and believe that relations with our AutoZoners are good.\n​\nTraining & Development\nWe have a number of different types of jobs and career opportunities. While many of our AutoZoners follow more traditional career paths (e.g., part-time to full-time sales, store manager, district manager, regional manager, vice president), we encourage cross-functional development and support of AutoZoners as they expand their careers into other departments and fields of interest within the Company. Many members of our senior leadership team have held positions in multiple areas of the business. We also invest in advanced leadership training to deepen our bench strength and support succession planning. For additional information, see “Store Personnel Training and Incentives” below. We believe these opportunities are important to attract, motivate and retain high quality AutoZoners.\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRecognition\nThe AutoZone Pledge and Values drive our success and foster a strong, unique culture of teamwork and customer service. We encourage the recognition of AutoZoners for a variety of accomplishments, such as going above and beyond to deliver Trustworthy Advice and WOW! Customer Service, taking initiative to prevent incidents and injuries, making contributions to help detect or report internal or external theft or providing significant service to help others. Whether they work in our stores, distribution centers, support centers or travel to support our customers and business, we believe AutoZoners everywhere should be recognized for their efforts and outstanding performance. We also recognize AutoZoners for their years of service to the organization and our customers.\n​\nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to providing a safe working and shopping environment for our AutoZoners and customers. Aligned with our values, we strive to continually monitor our working and shopping environment to keep our AutoZoners and customers as safe as possible.\n​\nAdditional information about our human capital resources can be found in our most recent Corporate Responsibility  Report, which is available on our website. Our Corporate Responsibility Report is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into this or any of our other filings with \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). \n​\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nStore Operations\nAt August 30, 2025, our stores were in the following locations:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nStore\n​\n​\nCount\nAlabama\n \n 134\nAlaska\n \n 8\nArizona\n \n 173\nArkansas\n \n 77\nCalifornia\n \n 681\nColorado\n \n 104\nConnecticut\n \n 59\nDelaware\n \n 23\nFlorida\n \n 455\nGeorgia\n \n 229\nHawaii\n \n 13\nIdaho\n \n 36\nIllinois\n \n 251\nIndiana\n \n 172\nIowa\n \n 40\nKansas\n \n 58\nKentucky\n \n 110\nLouisiana\n \n 139\nMaine\n \n 14\nMaryland\n \n 103\nMassachusetts\n \n 91\nMichigan\n \n 225\nMinnesota\n \n 69\nMississippi\n \n 102\nMissouri\n \n 124\nMontana\n \n 15\nNebraska\n \n 27\nNevada\n \n 75\nNew Hampshire\n \n 23\nNew Jersey\n \n 133\nNew Mexico\n \n 67\nNew York\n \n 233\nNorth Carolina\n \n 247\nNorth Dakota\n \n 8\nOhio\n \n 291\nOklahoma\n \n 93\nOregon\n \n 59\nPennsylvania\n \n 255\nPuerto Rico\n \n 67\nRhode Island\n \n 20\nSaint Thomas\n \n 2\nSouth Carolina\n \n 110\nSouth Dakota\n \n 10\nTennessee\n \n 189\nTexas\n \n 736\nUtah\n \n 74\nVermont\n \n 2\nVirginia\n \n 160\nWashington\n \n 102\nWashington, DC\n \n 5\nWest Virginia\n \n 45\nWisconsin\n \n 80\nWyoming\n \n 9\nTotal Domestic stores\n \n 6,627\nMexico\n \n 883\nBrazil\n \n 147\nTotal stores\n \n 7,657\n​\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nStore Formats\nSubstantially all stores are based on standard store formats, resulting in generally consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix with approximately 90% to 99% of each store’s square footage used as selling space. Most of our stores carry approximately 20,000 to 25,000 unique SKUs with 40% to 50% of the space dedicated to hard parts inventory. Hub stores carry approximately 40,000 to 50,000 unique SKUs and mega hub stores carry approximately 80,000 to 110,000 unique SKUs with 70% to 85% of their space utilized for hard parts. The hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store, dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store. The remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance, accessories and non-automotive items.\nStores are replenished primarily by the nearest distribution center but also typically have same-day access to one of our 367 domestic and 53 international hub stores’ expanded inventory assortment. As a subset of our domestic hub stores, we ended fiscal 2025 with 133 mega hub stores, an increase of 24 since the end of fiscal 2024. Additionally, we have eight mega hub stores in Mexico. Hub and mega hub stores work in concert with other stores to drive customer satisfaction through improved local parts availability and expanded product assortments. \nStore Personnel Training and Incentives\nWe provide on-the-job training as well as formal training programs, including an annual national sales meeting with related cascading meetings at our distribution centers, regional offices and stores; store meetings on specific sales and product topics; standardized computer-based training to support culture, safety, salesmanship, compliance and product and job knowledge; and several specialist, vendor and third-party programs to support learning and development in areas requiring technical expertise and specific job knowledge. All domestic AutoZoners are encouraged to complete our in-house product knowledge program and Parts Expert certification, which is developed in partnership with our key suppliers. Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management. Additionally, store managers, commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performance-based bonuses. \nStore Support Centers\nAll store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in Memphis, Tennessee; Monterrey, Mexico; Chihuahua, Mexico; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Gurugram, India. We believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level, while reducing expenses and cost of sales. In addition, we have offices in Shanghai, China and Istanbul, Turkey that provide sourcing or other support functions.\n​\nStore Automation\nAll of our stores have Z-net, our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our AutoZoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and provide complete job solutions, advice and information for customer vehicles. Z-net provides parts information based on year, make, model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store, at other nearby stores and through special order. The Z-net display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods, where both the AutoZoner and customer can view the screen.\nOur stores utilize our computerized proprietary Point-of-Sale System, which includes bar code scanning and point-of-sale data collection terminals. Our proprietary Store Management System provides administrative assistance, as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control. We believe the Point-of-Sale System also enhances customer service, while the Store Management System provides simplified warranty and product return procedures. \nCommercial\nOur commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market, and we are a leading distributor of automotive parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, fleet owners and other accounts in the Americas. As part of our program, we offer prompt delivery to our customers and commercial credit, as well as online ordering through www.autozonepro.com or through the AutoZone Pro mobile application. Through our hub and mega hub stores, we offer a larger assortment than our satellite stores of parts and \n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nproducts desired by professional technicians. We have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national, regional and fleet commercial accounts.\nStore Development\nThe following table reflects our store development during the past five fiscal years:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal Year\n​\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\n    \n2021\nStores:\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nBeginning\n \n 7,353\n \n 7,140\n \n 6,943\n \n 6,767\n \n 6,549\nNew\n \n 305\n \n 217\n \n 198\n \n 177\n \n 219\nClosed\n \n 1\n \n 4\n \n 1\n \n 1\n \n 1\nNet new\n \n 304\n \n 213\n \n 197\n \n 176\n \n 218\nRelocated\n \n 9\n \n 6\n \n 12\n \n 13\n \n 12\nEnding\n \n 7,657\n \n 7,353\n \n 7,140\n \n 6,943\n \n 6,767\n​\nWe believe expansion opportunities exist in markets we do not currently serve, as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence. We undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets. The most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate. Key factors in selecting new site and market locations for stores include population, demographics, vehicle profile, customer buying trends, commercial businesses, number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate. In reviewing the vehicle profile, we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older, or “our kind of vehicles;” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles. We seek to open new stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time.\n \nWe believe our stores are “destination stores,” generating their own traffic, therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking. \nIn addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations, we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions.\nMarketing and Merchandising Strategy\nWe are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in our conveniently located, well-designed stores and through our online platforms. Key elements of this strategy are:\nCustomer Service\nCustomer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy, which is based upon consumer marketing research. We emphasize that our AutoZoners should always put customers first by providing prompt, courteous service and trustworthy advice. Our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties offered by us or our vendors. In addition to our in-store offerings, we sell our full suite of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive parts through www.autozone.com, for pick-up in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business, with same day or next day delivery programs in most of our U.S. markets. Additionally, we offer a mobile application that provides customers with store locations, driving directions, operating hours, product availability, the ability to purchase products and other information.\nWe also provide access to specialty tools as one of our free services. Through our Loan-A-Tool program customers can borrow a specialty tool, such as a steering wheel puller, for which a do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customer or a repair shop would have little or no subsequent use beyond a single job. AutoZoners also provide free diagnostic and related services, including check engine and anti-lock braking system light readings through our AutoZone Fix Finder service, testing of starters, alternators and batteries, battery charging and the collection of used oil for recycling.\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMerchandising\nThe following tables show some of the types of products we sell by major category of items:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFailure\n    \nMaintenance\n     \nAccessories\nA/C Compressors \nBatteries & Accessories \nBearings \nBelts & Hoses \nCalipers \nChassis \nClutches \nCV Axles \nEngines \nFuel Pumps \nFuses \nIgnition \nLighting \nMufflers \nRadiators \nStarters & Alternators \nThermostats \nTire Repair \nWater Pumps\n​\nAntifreeze & Windshield Washer Fluid \nBrake Drums, Rotors, Shoes & Pads \nChemicals, including Brake & Power \n   Steering Fluid, Oil & Fuel Additives \nOil & Transmission Fluid \nOil, Cabin, Air, Fuel & Transmission   \n   Filters \nOxygen Sensors \nPaint & Accessories \nRefrigerant & Accessories \nShock Absorbers & Struts \nSpark Plugs & Wires \nWindshield Wipers\n​\nAir Fresheners \nCell Phone Accessories \nDrinks & Snacks \nFloor Mats & Seat Covers \nInterior & Exterior Accessories \nMirrors \nPerformance Products \nProtectants & Cleaners \nSealants & Adhesives \nSteering Wheel Covers \nTools\nTowing\nVehicle Entertainment Systems \nWash & Wax \n​\n​\n​\nWe believe customer satisfaction is often impacted by our ability to promptly provide specific automotive products as requested. Each store carries the same basic products, but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and tailor the remaining store’s assortment to the local demographics. Our hub and mega hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that are available to customers of the surrounding local stores. We are continuously updating the products we offer to ensure our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire.\nPricing\nWe want to be the value leader in our industry, by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price, backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service. For many of our products, we offer multiple value choices in a good/better/best assortment, with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products. A key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of in-house brands, which includes Duralast and the family of Duralast brands, Econocraft, ProElite, ShopPro, SureBilt, TotalPro, TruGrade and Valucraft. We believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors.\nBrand Marketing: Marketing and Loyalty\nWe believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment. We are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so we can build long-lasting, loyal relationships. We utilize advertising, direct marketing, loyalty programs and promotions primarily to highlight our great value, the availability of high quality parts and develop a relationship with an expanding base of customers. Digital and broadcast media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic, while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our ProVantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales. \nStore Design, Visual Merchandising and Promotional Execution\nWe design and build stores for high visual impact. The typical store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage, exposed beams and ductwork, finished floors and brightly lit interiors. Batteries, maintenance products, accessories and non-automotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers. In-store signage and special displays promote products on floor displays, end caps and shelves. We utilize in-store signage, creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they may need.\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\nPurchasing and Supply Chain\nMerchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in Memphis, Tennessee; Monterrey, Mexico; Chihuahua, Mexico; Sao Paulo, Brazil and Gurugram, India. Additionally, we have offices in Shanghai, China and Istanbul, Turkey to support our global sourcing efforts. In fiscal 2025, one class of similar products accounted for approximately 14 percent of our total revenues, and one individual vendor provided 13 percent of our total purchases. No other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total revenues, and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases. We believe alternative sources of supply exist, at similar costs, for most types of product sold. Most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by third-party transportation firms. The distribution centers replenish our stores up to multiple times per week depending on store sales volumes.\nCompetition\nThe sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive. AutoZone competes on the basis of customer service, including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners and our ability to provide prompt delivery to commercial customers; merchandise quality, selection and availability; product warranty; store layouts, location and convenience; price; and the strength of our AutoZone brand name and quality, trademarks and service marks.\nOur competitors include national, regional and local auto parts chains, independently owned parts stores, online automotive parts stores or marketplaces, wholesale distributors, jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories and tools. \nGovernment Relations\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in the jurisdictions in which we operate, many of which are complex, frequently changing and subject to varying interpretations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, the marketing and sale of products; proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials, particularly in connection with our used oil, oil filter and battery recycling programs; occupational health and safety; environmental matters; labor and employment; employee wages and benefits; information security and data privacy; real property; financial reporting and disclosure; antitrust and fair competition; international trade and transportation, logistics and delivery operations. \nWhile compliance with the numerous laws and regulations applicable to our business, including environmental regulations, has not had a material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position to date, we can make no assurances as to the future costs of compliance. For more information, see the Risk Factors titled \n“Legal and Regulatory Risks” \nand\n “Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks”\n in “Part I. Item 1A, Risk Factors” in this report.\nTrademarks and Patents\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success and important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies. We have registered several trademarks and service marks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as in certain other countries, including without limitation: “AutoZone,” “AutoZone Rewards,” “Get in the Zone,” “Zone,” “Duralast,” “Econocraft,” “ProElite,” “ShopPro,” “SureBilt,” “TotalPro,” “TruGrade,” “Valucraft,” and “ALLDATA,” along with variations of these trademarks. Our trademark registrations have various expiration dates; however, assuming that the trademarks are properly maintained and in use, such registrations may typically be renewed indefinitely. \n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality\nOur business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of February through September, and the lowest sales in the months of December and January. During short periods of time, a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail; thereby increasing sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales, as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, we believe the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the Americas.\nAutoZone Websites\nOur primary website is www.autozone.com. We make available on the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, registration statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably feasible after filing or furnishing such documents with the SEC.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are a leading retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the Americas. We began operations in 1979 and at August 30, 2025, operated 6,627 stores in the U.S., 883 stores in Mexico and 147 stores in Brazil. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light duty trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. At August 30, 2025, in 6,098 of our domestic stores as well as the vast majority of our stores in Mexico and Brazil, we had a commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts and other products and commercial credit to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, fleet owners and other accounts. We also sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. Additionally, we sell the ALLDATA brand of automotive diagnostic, repair, collision and shop management software through www.alldata.com. We also provide product information on our Duralast branded products through www.duralastparts.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services.\nExecutive Summary\nFor fiscal 2025, net sales increased to $18.9 billion, a 2.4% increase over the prior year. \nDomestic commercial sales increased 6.7%, which represents 31.7% of our total Domestic sales\n. Operating profit decreased 4.7% to $3.6 billion, net income decreased 6.2% to $2.5 billion and diluted earnings per share decreased 3.1% to $144.87 for the year.\nFiscal 2025 consisted of 52 weeks whereas fiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks. The inclusion of the 53\nrd\n week in fiscal 2024 resulted in an increase to net sales of $365.9 million and an increase in operating profit of $86.7 million. Additionally, fiscal 2025 comparisons were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates which had an unfavorable impact to net sales of $273.1 million and operating profit of $88.2 million. Operating profit comparison was also negatively impacted by an unfavorable net non-cash LIFO impact of $104.0 million.\nDuring fiscal 2025, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 85% of total sales. While we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years, we have seen a slight decrease in mix of sales of the accessories category and a slight increase in the maintenance and failure categories compared to the previous two years.\nOur business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including but not limited to inflation, interest rates, levels of consumer debt, fuel and energy costs, prevailing wage rates, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, tariffs, trade policies and other geopolitical factors, hiring and other economic conditions. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, which are generally outside of our control, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.\n​\nThe two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven-year-old or older vehicles on the road.\nMiles Driven\nWe believe as the number of miles driven increases, consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. For the twelve-month period ended July 2025, miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.0% compared to the same period in the prior year based on the latest information available from the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nSeven Year Old or Older Vehicles\nAs the number of seven-year-old or older vehicles on the road increases, we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell. We expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer. According to the latest data provided by S&P Global Mobility, the average age of light vehicles on the road increased slightly to 12.8 years and these vehicles account for approximately 43% of U.S. vehicles.\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation – Federal Highway Administration, vehicles are driven an average of approximately 11,000 miles each year. In seven years, the average miles driven equates to approximately 77,000 miles. Our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life, most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance and repairs are needed to keep the vehicle operating.\n29\n\n\nTable of

Time-Off of approximately $43.0 million (pre-tax).\n(3) \n Fiscal 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021 include excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of $58.2 million, $81.4 million, $92.2 million, $63.2 million, and $56.4 million, respectively.\n(4) \n The domestic and international comparable sales increases are based on sales for all AutoZone stores open at least one year. Constant currency same store sales exclude impacts from fluctuations of foreign exchange rates by converting both the current year and prior year international results at the prior year foreign currency exchange rate. Same store sales are computed on a 52-week basis. Relocated stores are included in the same store sales computation based on the year the original store was opened. Closed store sales are included in the same store sales computation up to the week it closes, and excluded from the computation for all periods subsequent to closing. All sales through our www.autozone.com website, including consumer direct ship-to-home sales, are also included in the computation. \n(5) \n During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company temporarily suspended share repurchases under the share repurchase program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which was restarted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\n(6) \n Inventory turnover is calculated as cost of sales divided by the average merchandise inventory balance over the trailing 5 quarters.\n(7) \n After-tax return on invested capital is defined as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize leases). \n(8) \n Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is defined as the sum of total debt, finance lease obligations and annual rents times six; divided by net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n(9) \n Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is defined as the change in cash and cash equivalents less the change in debt plus treasury stock purchases. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(10) \nShare repurchases are inclusive of excise tax in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. The excise tax is assessed at one percent of the fair market value of net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022.\n​\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFiscal 2025 Compared with Fiscal 2024\nFor the fiscal year ended August 30, 2025, we had net sales of $18.9 billion compared with $18.5 billion for the year ended August 31, 2024, an increase of 2.4%. This growth was driven primarily by a domestic same store sales increase of 3.2% and net sales of $374.3 million from new domestic and international stores. Domestic commercial sales increased $329.5 million, or 6.7%, compared to fiscal 2024 domestic commercial sales. \nSame store sales, or sales for our domestic and international stores open at least one year, are computed on a 52-week basis and are as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal Year Ended August\n​\n​\n​\n    \n​\n    \n​\nConstant Currency\n (1)\n    \n​\n​\n2025\n​\n2024\n​\n2025\n​\n2024\nDomestic\n​\n 3.2\n%  \n​\n 0.4\n%  \n​\n 3.2\n%  \n​\n 0.4\n%  \nInternational\n \n(3.2\n%)  \n \n 16.1\n%  \n \n 9.3\n%  \n \n 10.2\n%  \nTotal Company\n \n 2.4\n%  \n \n 2.1\n%  \n \n 3.9\n%  \n \n 1.4\n%  \n​\n(1)\nConstant currency same store sales exclude impacts from fluctuations of foreign exchange rates by converting both the current year and prior year international results at the prior year foreign currency exchange rate.\n​\nGross profit for fiscal 2025 was $10.0 billion, or 52.6% of net sales, a 47 basis point decrease compared with $9.8 billion, or 53.1% of net sales for fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross margin was driven by 55 basis points ($64.0 million charge in the current year versus $40.0 million benefit in the prior year) from non-cash LIFO impact.\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2025 increased to $6.4 billion, or 33.6% of net sales, from $6.0 billion, or 32.6% of net sales for fiscal 2024. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by investments to support our growth initiatives.\nInterest expense, net for fiscal 2025 was $475.8 million compared with $451.6 million during fiscal 2024. Average borrowings for fiscal 2025 were $9.0 billion, compared with $8.7 billion for fiscal 2024. Weighted average borrowing rates were 4.48% and 4.39% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOur effective income tax rate was 20.3% and 20.2% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. The benefit from stock options exercised in fiscal 2025 was $58.2 million compared to $81.4 million in fiscal 2024 (see “Note E – Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \nNet income for fiscal 2025 decreased by 6.2% to $2.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share decreased 3.1% to $144.87 from $149.55 in fiscal 2024. The impact on the fiscal 2025 diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases was an increase of $0.26.\nFiscal 2024 Compared with Fiscal 2023\nA discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2023 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and at www.autozone.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page.\nQuarterly Periods\nEach of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2025, 17 weeks in 2024 and 16 weeks in 2023. Because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of our annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 represented 33.0% of annual sales and 33.5% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 represented \n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\n33.6% of annual sales and 33.9% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 represented 32.6% of annual sales and 34.2% of net income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts, products and accessories. We believe that our cash generated from operating activities, available cash reserves and available credit, supplemented with our long-term borrowings will provide ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support growth initiatives and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As of August 30, 2025, we held $271.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $2.2 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, without giving effect to commercial paper borrowings. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business, repay our debt as it becomes due and fund our share repurchases over the short-term and long-term. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. \nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2025, $3.0 billion in 2024 and $2.9 billion in 2023. Cash flows from operations increased slightly over last year primarily due to favorable changes in deferred income taxes.\nOur net cash flows used in investing activities were $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $876.2 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures. We invested $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $796.7 million in capital assets in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by our growth initiatives, including investments in new stores and hub and mega hub store expansions. We had net new store openings of 304, 213 and 197 for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities. We purchased marketable debt securities of $64.5 million, $38.8 million and $66.9 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of $63.3 million, $40.8 million and $58.4 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net investment in tax credit equity investments was $111.8 million, $227.5 million and $98.0 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion, $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock, which totaled $1.6 billion, $3.1 billion and $3.7 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and increased borrowings in fiscal 2024 and 2023. During the year ended August 30, 2025, we repaid our $400 million 3.250% Senior Notes and $500 million 3.625% Senior Notes due April 2025 and issued $500 million of new debt compared to $2.3 billion in 2024 and $1.8 billion in 2023. In fiscal years 2025 and 2023 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes. In fiscal year 2024 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. \nThe Company had net proceeds from commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $168.6 million during fiscal 2025, net repayments of commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $629.6 million during fiscal 2024 and net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $606.2 million during fiscal 2023. \nDuring fiscal 2026, we expect to moderately increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2025. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our growth initiatives, including new stores and expanded hub and mega hub stores.\n \nThe amount of investments in our new stores is impacted by different factors, including whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment) and whether such buildings are located in the U.S., Mexico or Brazil, or located in urban or rural areas.\nIn addition to building and land costs, our new stores and distribution centers require working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We plan to continue leveraging our \n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\ninventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our suppliers’ ability to factor their receivables from us. T\nhe Company has arrangements with third-party financial institutions to confirm invoice balances owed by the Company to certain suppliers and pay the financial institutions the confirmed amounts on the invoice due dates. These arrangements allow the Company’s inventory suppliers, at their sole discretion, to enter into agreements with these financial institutions to finance the Company’s obligations to the suppliers at terms negotiated between the suppliers and the financial institutions. Supplier participation is optional and our obligations to our suppliers, including the amount and dates due, are not impacted by our suppliers’ decision to enter into an agreement with a third-party financial institution. \nA downgrade in our credit ratings or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions’ and our suppliers’ willingness to participate in these arrangements. We plan to continue negotiating extended terms with our suppliers, benefitting our working capital and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 114.2% at August 30, 2025, and 119.5% at August 31, 2024. \nDepending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.\nOur cash balances are held in various locations around the world. As of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents of $79.1 million and $99.8 million, respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support the liquidity needs in our foreign operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended August 30, 2025, our adjusted after-tax return on invested capital (“ROIC”), which is a non-GAAP measure, was 41.3% as compared to 49.7% for the prior year. Adjusted ROIC is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). We use adjusted ROIC to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. Refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further details of our calculation.\nDebt Facilities\nOn November 15, 2024, we amended our existing revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”)\n, to extend the termination date by one year. As amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate, and all amounts borrowed will be due and payable, on November 15, 2028\n. Revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be base rate loans, Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) loans, or a combination of both, at our election. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes (i) a $75 million sublimit for swingline loans, (ii) a $50 million individual issuer letter of credit sublimit and (iii) a $250 million aggregate sublimit for all letters of credit.\nCovenants under our Revolving Credit Agreement include restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances.\nAs of August 30, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings and $1.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement. \nThe Revolving Credit Agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.5:1. This ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of August 30, 2025, was 5.1:1.\nWe also maintained a letter of credit facility that allowed us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $25 million. The letter of credit facility was in addition to the letters of \n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncredit that may be issued under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of August 31, 2024, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility, which was terminated in September 2024.\nIn addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Agreement discussed above, we had $149.1 million in letters of credit outstanding as of August 30, 2025. These letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis.\nAs of August 30, 2025, the $748.6 million of commercial paper borrowings, the $400 million 3.125% Senior Notes due April 2026 and the $450 million 5.050% Senior Notes due July 2026 were classified as long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have the current ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility. As of August 30, 2025, we had $2.2 billion of availability under our Revolving Credit Agreement, which would allow us to replace these short-term obligations with a long-term financing facility. \nOn April 15, 2025, we repaid the $400 million 3.250% Senior Notes due April 2025 and our $500 million 3.625% Senior Notes due April 2025.\nOn April 18, 2024, we repaid the $300 million 3.125% Senior Notes due April 2024.\nOn July 17, 2023, we repaid the $500 million 3.125% Senior Notes due July 2023.\nOn January 17, 2023, we repaid the $300 million 2.875% Senior Notes due January 2023.\nOn April 14, 2025, we issued $\n500\n million \n5.125\n% Senior Notes due June 2030 \nunder our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on July 19, 2022 (File No. 333-266209) (the “2022 Shelf Registration Statement”). The 2022 Shelf Registration Statement allowed us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store or distribution center openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions.\n Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn June 28, 2024, we issued $600 million in 5.100% Senior Notes due July 2029 and $700 million 5.400% Senior Notes due July 2034 under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes.\nOn October 25, 2023, we issued $500 million in 6.250% Senior Notes due November 2028 and $500 million 6.550% Senior Notes due November 2033 under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn July 21, 2023, we issued $450 million in 5.050% Senior Notes due July 2026 and \n$300 million in 5.200% Senior Notes due August 2033 under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement.\n Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 27, 2023 we issued $450 million in 4.500% Senior Notes due February 2028 and $550 million in 4.750% Senior Notes due February 2033 under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Senior Notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our Senior Notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens, sale and leaseback transactions and consolidations, mergers and the sale of assets. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the applicable scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. Interest is paid on a semi-annual basis. \n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs of August 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements.\nFor the fiscal years ended August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense (“EBITDAR”) ratio was 2.5:1 for both periods. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, finance lease liabilities and rent times six; and we calculate adjusted EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense to net income. We target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels. To the extent adjusted EBITDAR increases, we expect our debt levels to increase; conversely, if adjusted EBITDAR decreases, we would expect our debt levels to decrease. Refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further details of our calculation.\nStock Repurchases\nDuring 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our Board of Directors (the “Board”). On June 19, 2024, the Board voted to increase the repurchase authorization by $1.5 billion, bringing the total authorization to $39.2 billion. From January 1998 to August 30, 2025, we have repurchased a total of 155.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $38.5 billion. We repurchased 0.4 million, 1.1 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.5 billion, $3.2 billion and $3.7 billion during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Considering cumulative repurchases as of August 30, 2025 we had $632.3 million remaining under the Board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock. We will continue to evaluate current and expected business conditions and adjust the level of share repurchases under our share repurchase program in a manner that is consistent with our capital allocation strategy or as we otherwise deem appropriate.\nCash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was $1.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2025, August 31, 2024 and August 26, 2023, respectively. Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less net increases or decreases in debt (excluding deferred financing costs) plus share repurchases. We use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available. We believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares, while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings. Refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further details of our calculation.\nOn October 8, 2025, the Board voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional $1.5 billion of our common stock in connection with our ongoing share repurchase program. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1998, the Board has authorized $40.7 billion in share repurchases. Subsequent to August 30, 2025, and through October 20, 2025, we have repurchased 51,543 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $215.6 million. Considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to August 30, 2025, and through October 20, 2025, we have $1.9 billion remaining under the Board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock.\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Commitments\nThe following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of August 30, 2025:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal\n​\nPayment Due by Period\n​\n​\nContractual\n​\nLess than\n​\nBetween\n​\nBetween\n​\nOver\n(in thousands)\n​\nObligations\n \n1 year\n \n1\n‑\n3 years\n \n3\n‑\n5 years\n \n5 years\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDebt\n(1)\n    \n$\n 8,848,600\n​\n$\n 1,598,600\n​\n$\n 1,050,000\n​\n$\n 2,800,000\n​\n$\n 3,400,000\nInterest payments\n(2)\n​\n \n 1,951,388\n​\n​\n 370,125\n​\n​\n 637,175\n​\n​\n 489,950\n​\n​\n 454,138\nOperating leases\n(3)\n​\n \n 4,382,768\n​\n​\n 424,466\n​\n​\n 891,971\n​\n​\n 779,934\n​\n​\n 2,286,397\nFinance leases\n(3)\n​\n \n 464,987\n​\n​\n 112,918\n​\n​\n 223,305\n​\n​\n 88,985\n​\n​\n 39,779\nSelf-insurance reserves\n(4)\n​\n \n 280,103\n​\n​\n 82,630\n​\n​\n 105,300\n​\n​\n 45,436\n​\n​\n 46,737\nConstruction commitments\n​\n \n 130,480\n​\n \n 130,480\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\nTransferable federal tax credits\n​\n​\n 207,156\n​\n​\n 207,156\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n$\n 16,265,482\n​\n$\n 2,926,375\n​\n$\n 2,907,751\n​\n$\n 4,204,305\n​\n$\n 6,227,051\n​\n(1)\nDebt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest, discounts, and debt issuance costs.\n(2)\nRepresents obligations for interest payments on long-term debt.\n(3)\nOperating and finance lease obligations include related interest in accordance with ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\n(4)\nSelf-insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations and are presented net of insurance receivables. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments is predictable based upon historical patterns. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nOur tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $22.3 million at August 30, 2025. Approximately $4.2 million is classified as current liabilities and $18.1 million is classified as long-term liabilities. We did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the long-term liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions. \n​\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 30, 2025:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nTotal \n​\n​\nOther \n(in thousands)\n​\nCommitments\n​\n​\n​\n​\nStandby letters of credit\n​\n$\n 150,761\nSurety bonds\n​\n​\n 100,496\n​\n​\n$\n 251,257\n​\nA substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers.\nThere are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

These non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year-to-year operating results. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board use the above-mentioned non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performance-based compensation.

Accounting Estimates\nPreparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified self-insurance reserves as a critical accounting estimate that is materially impacted by assumptions and has discussed this policy with the Audit Committee of our Board. \nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nWe retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation, general and product liability, property and vehicle insurance; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. Our self-insurance reserve estimates totaled $268.8 million at August 30, 2025, and $257.7 million at August 31, 2024. Where estimates are possible, losses covered by insurance are recognized on a gross basis with a corresponding insurance receivable.\nThe assumptions made by management in estimating our self-insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and use of a specialist, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported. The actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. When estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors. In recent history, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. As we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly.\nManagement believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. For example, changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $20.0 million for fiscal 2025. \nOur liabilities for workers’ compensation, general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long-term using the risk-free interest rate as of the balance sheet dates.\nIf the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 25 basis points, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.3 million for fiscal 2025.",
