(SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.’s (ATTC) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider. \nFollowing our formation, we expanded our communications footprint and operations, most significantly:\n•\nOur subsidiaries merged with incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) Pacific Telesis Group in 1997 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999.\n•\nIn 2005, we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from “SBC Communications Inc.” to “AT&T Inc.”\n•\nIn 2006, we acquired ILEC BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth), which included BellSouth’s 40% economic interest in AT&T Mobility LLC (AT&T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100% ownership of AT&T Mobility.\n•\nIn 2014, we completed the acquisition of wireless provider Leap Wireless International, Inc. \n•\nIn 2015, we acquired wireless properties in Mexico and acquired DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States (included in our Video business) and Latin America (referred to as Vrio).\n•\nFrom 2018 through April 2022, we acquired and held various investments in entertainment businesses, namely Time Warner Inc., which comprised a substantial portion of our previous WarnerMedia segment.\n•\nIn July 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction (DIRECTV Transaction), we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method. In September 2024, we agreed to sell our remaining interest in DIRECTV to TPG, which we expect to close in mid-2025.\n•\nIn April 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction). Upon its separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as did other dispositions that were part of a single plan, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia separation.\n1\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nGeneral\nWe are a leading provider of telecommunications and technology services globally. The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\nThe \nCommunications segment \nprovides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the United States and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect integrated product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n•\nMobility \nprovides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n•\nBusiness Wireline \nprovides advanced ethernet-based fiber services, fixed wireless services, IP Voice and managed professional services, as well as legacy voice and data services and related equipment, to business customers. \n•\nConsumer Wireline \nprovides broadband services, including fiber connections that provide multi-gig services, and our fixed wireless access product (AT&T Internet Air or “AIA”) that provides internet services delivered over our 5G wireless network, to residential customers in select locations. Consumer Wireline also provides legacy telephony voice communication services.\nThe \nLatin America segment \nprovides wireless service and equipment in Mexico. \nCorporate support costs, including administrative support costs borne by AT&T where business units do not influence decision making and results from business no longer integral to our operations are reported as \nCorporate \nand\n Other\n, which\n \nreconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes. \nAreas of Focus\nWe are a leader in providing connectivity services through our market focus areas of 5G and fiber. Fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, both wired and wireless. Building on that fiber foundation is our solid spectrum portfolio, strengthened through Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction acquisitions and 5G deployment. We believe our fixed wireline and mobile approach will differentiate our services and provide us with additional convergence growth opportunities in the future as bandwidth demands continue to grow. We will continue to demonstrate our commitment to ensure management attention is sharply focused on growth areas and operational efficiencies.\nOur integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms to provide instant connectivity at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements. Streaming, augmented reality, “smart” technologies, user generated content and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to continue to drive greater demand for broadband, which we believe will allow us to capitalize on our fiber and 5G deployments. During 2025, we are focused on the core capabilities of our products, our infrastructure and our network. Our concentration is to aggregate the most traffic on the largest, lowest marginal cost, converged network through efficient spectrum deployment and construction of the largest high-capacity broadband solutions in the United States, while also working with regulators and customers to decommission high-cost legacy technologies over the next several years.\nDuring 2024, we collaborated with Ericsson to lead the U.S. in commercial scale open radio access network (Open RAN) deployment to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, fostering lower network costs, improved operational efficiencies and allowing for continued investment in our fast-growing broadband network. We plan for about 70% of our wireless network traffic to flow across open-capable platforms by late 2026. Beginning in 2025, we expect to scale this Open RAN environment throughout our wireless network in coordination with multiple suppliers. We believe the move to an open, agile, programmable wireless network positions us to quickly capitalize on the next generation of wireless technology and spectrum when it becomes available. These innovative technologies are expected to enable lower-power, sustainable networks with higher performance to deliver enhanced user experiences.\nWireless Service \nWe continue to experience rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices, and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet. The deployment of 5G, which allows for faster connectivity, lower latency and greater bandwidth, requires modifications of existing cell sites to add equipment supporting new frequencies, like the C-Band and the 3.45 GHz band. The increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5G technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services. As the wireless industry has matured, with nearly full penetration of smartphones in the U.S. population, future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services, plans and devices that bundle product offerings and take advantage of our 5G wireless network. \nTo support higher mobile data usage, our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geogra\nphic basis as possible. \nWe expect to continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, as well as obtaining additional spectrum, when available, that meets our long-term needs. We participate in FCC spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support \n2\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nmore advanced mobile internet services. \nAdditionally, in November 2024, we agreed to purchase select spectrum licenses from United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular) for approximately $1,000, subject to closing conditions, including the consummation of UScellular’s proposed sale of its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile US, Inc. \nIn North America, our network covers over 440 million people with 4G LTE and over 314 million with 5G technology. In the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 336 million people with our LTE technology and more than 314 million people with our 5G technology. \nBroadband Technology \nIn 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to expand our fiber footprint and grow customers. At December 31, 2024, we had more than 9.3 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding 1.0 million during the year. The expansion builds on our recent investments to convert to a software-based network, managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network supports next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently. At December 31, 2024, we had 15.3 million broadband connections, compared to 15.1 million broadband connections in the prior year.\nCopper Decommissioning \nWhile building the network of the future, we are actively working to exit our legacy copper network operations across the large majority of our wireline footprint. Our exit strategy includes migrating customers to fiber and wireless alternatives, and working with policy-makers to decommission our inefficient and less reliable copper network. At December 31, 2024, we had 3.3 million network access lines in service and 127,000 DSL subscribers compared, to 4.2 million network access lines in service and 210,000 DSL subscribers in the prior year.\nBUSINESS OPERATIONS\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nOur segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.\nAdditional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading “Segment Results” in Item 7 and in Note 4 of Item 8.\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nOur Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&T, AT&T Business, Cricket, AT&T PREPAID\nSM\n, AT&T Fiber and AT&T Internet Air brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2024 segment operating revenues and accounted for substantially all of our 2024 total segment operating income. This segment contains the Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units.\nMobility – \nOur Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless service to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid or reseller. As of December 31, 2024, we served 118 million Mobility subscribers, including 89 million postpaid (73 million phone), 19 million prepaid and 10 million through resellers. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\nService\nWe offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through FirstNet\n®\n services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.\nConsumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer unlimited plans that include features allowing for the sharing of voice, text and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.\nWe also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&T PREPAID brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.\n3\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nEquipment\nWe sell a wide variety of handsets, wireless data cards and wireless computing devices manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases/protective covers and wireless chargers. We sell online and through our own company-owned stores, agents and third-party retail stores. We provide our customers the ability to purchase handsets on an installment basis and the opportunity to bring their own device. Subscribers that bring their own devices or retain handsets for longer periods impact upgrade activity. Like other wireless service providers, we also provide postpaid contract subscribers promotional equipment offers to initiate, renew or upgrade service.\nBusiness Wireline – \nOur Business Wireline business unit provides services to business customers, including multinational corporations, small and mid-sized businesses, and governmental and wholesale customers. Our Business Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\nService\nWe offer fiber and other advanced connectivity services, such as AT&T Dedicated Internet, fiber ethernet and broadband, fixed wireless, and hosted and managed professional services, as well as legacy voice and other transitional services comprised of copper-based voice and data, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), wholesale, outsourcing and IP sales. Historically, a majority of our Business Wireline service revenues came from legacy copper-based voice and data and traditional products; however, over recent years those services have been declining due to secular pressures. \nWe continue to reconfigure our wireline network to take advantage of the latest technologies and services, and rely on our SDN and NFV to enhance business customers’ digital agility in a rapidly evolving environment. Some of the services we have offered historically are in secular decline and, going forward, we will focus on our owned and operated connectivity services powered by 5G and fiber as well as evaluating opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure.\nEquipment\nEquipment revenues include customer premises equipment.\nConsumer Wireline\n – Our Consumer Wireline business unit provides broadband services, including fiber connections, AIA and legacy telephony voice communication services, to customers in the United States by utilizing our IP-based and copper wired network. Our Consumer Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: broadband, legacy voice and data services and other service and equipment.\nBroadband Service\nWe provide broadband and internet services to approximately 14.1 million customers, including 9.3 million fiber broadband subscribers at December 31, 2024. With changes in video viewing preferences and the impacts of remote learning trends, we are experiencing increasing demand for high-speed broadband services. We believe our investment in expanding our industry-leading fiber network positions us to be a leader in wired connectivity. Our focus on fiber brings owners economics and expected efficiencies while we continue to evaluate opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure. \nWe believe that our flexible platform, with a broadband and wireless connection, is the most efficient way to transport direct-to-consumer video and data experiences both at home and on mobile devices. Through this integrated approach, we can optimize the use of storage in the home as well as in the cloud, while also providing a seamless service for consumers across screens and locations. \nLegacy Voice and Data Services\nRevenues from our traditional voice services continue to decline as customers switch to wireless or VoIP services provided by us, cable companies or other internet-based providers.\nOther Service and Equipment\nOther service revenues include VoIP services, customer fees and equipment.\nAdditional information on our Communications segment is contained in the “Overview” section of Item 7.\nLATIN AMERICA\nOur Latin America segment provides wireless service in Mexico. We utilize our regional and national wireless networks in Mexico to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. The Latin America segment provided approximately 3% of 2024 segment operating revenues and less than 1% of our 2024 total segment operating income. We divide our revenue into the following categories: service and equipment.\n4\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nService\nWe provide postpaid and prepaid wireless services in Mexico to approximately 24 million subscribers under the AT&T and Unefon brands. Postpaid service allows for (1) no annual service contract for subscribers who bring their own device or purchase a device on installment and (2) service contracts for periods up to 36 months for subscribers who purchase their equipment under the traditional device subsidy model. We also offer prepaid plans.\nEquipment\nWe sell a wide variety of handsets, including smartphones manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We sell through our own company-owned stores, agents and third-party retail stores.\nAdditional information on our Latin America segment is contained in the “Overview” section of Item 7.\nMAJOR CLASSES OF SERVICE\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total consolidated reported operating revenues by any class of service that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated total operating revenues in any of the last three fiscal years:\nPercentage of Total \nConsolidated Operating Revenues\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommunications Segment\nWireless service\n53\n \n %\n52 \n %\n50 \n %\nBusiness service\n15\n \n17 \n18 \nEquipment\n17\n \n17 \n18 \nLatin America Segment\nWireless service\n2\n \n2 \n2 \nEquipment\n1\n \n1 \n1 \nAdditional information on our geographical distribution of revenues is contained in Note 4 of Item 8.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nFacilities-based wireless communications providers in the United States, like AT&T, must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with FCC rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum. The FCC’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high-quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period, typically 10 to 15 years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings have historically not been subject to prescriptive regulation, the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services.\nThe Communications Act of 1934 and other related laws give the FCC broad authority to regulate the U.S. operations of our interstate telecommunications services. In addition, our ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.\nWe continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize and/or moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.\nOur subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided.\n5\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nFor a discussion of significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations, please see the information contained under the headings “Operating Environment and Trends of the Business” and “Regulatory Landscape” of Item 7, which information is incorporated herein by reference. \nIMPORTANCE, DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES\nCertain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business. Many of our subsidiaries also hold government-issued licenses or franchises to provide wireline or wireless services. Additional information relating to regulations affecting those rights is contained under the heading “Operating Environment and Trends of the Business” of Item 7. We actively pursue patents, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the United States and abroad. We maintain a significant global portfolio of patents, trademarks and service mark registrations. We have also entered into licenses that permit other companies to utilize certain of our patents, trademarks, service marks, and technologies, in exchange for payments and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions. As we transition our network from a switch-based network to an IP, software-based network, we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers.\nWe periodically license third-party patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for payments. We also receive claims from third parties asserting that our products, services or technologies infringe on their patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims could require us to pay damages or acquire license rights, stop offering the relevant products or services, and/or cease network functions or other activities. While the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or non-renewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMAJOR CUSTOMERS\nNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nCOMPETITION\nCompetition continues to increase for communications and digital services from traditional and nontraditional competitors. Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available. In addition, lack of or a reduced level of regulation of comparable legacy services has lowered costs for alternative communications service providers. As a result, we face continuing competition as well as some new opportunities in significant portions of our business.\nWireless \nWe face substantial competition in our wireless businesses. Under current FCC rules, multiple licensees, who provide wireless services on the cellular, PCS, Advanced Wireless Services, 700 MHz and other spectrum bands, may operate in each of our U.S. service areas. Our competitors include two national wireless providers; a larger number of regional providers and resellers of each of those providers’ services; and certain cable companies. In addition, we face competition from providers who offer voice, text messaging and other services as applications on data networks. We are one of three facilities-based providers in Mexico (retail and wholesale), with the most significant market share controlled by América Móvil. We may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services. While some of these technologies and services are now operational, others are being developed or may be developed. We compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network quality, coverage area and customer service.\nBroadband \nThe desire for high-speed data on demand, including video, is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or copper-based services and use our fiber or fixed wireless services or competitors’ wireless, satellite and internet-based services. In most U.S. markets, we compete for customers with large cable companies and wireless broadband providers for high-speed internet and voice services.\nLegacy Voice and Data \nWe continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to industry-wide secular declines and competitors (e.g., wireless, cable and VoIP providers) who can provide comparable services at lower prices because they are not subject to traditional telephone industry regulation (or the extent of regulation they are subject to is in dispute), utilize different technologies or promote a different business model. In most U.S. markets, we compete for customers with large cable companies and other smaller telecommunications companies.\nAdditionally, we provide local and interstate telephone and switched services to other service providers, primarily large internet service providers using the largest class of nationwide internet networks (internet backbone), wireless carriers, other telephone companies, cable companies and systems integrators. These services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies, the introduction of innovative offerings and increasing satellite, wireless, fiber-optic and cable transmission capacity for services.\n6\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nAT&T scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas, including IP networking, advanced network design and architecture, network and cybersecurity, network operations support systems and data analytics. The majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers. Research and development expenses were $955 in 2024, $954 in 2023, and $1,236 in 2022.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nNumber of Employees\n As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 140,990 persons.\nEmployee Development\n We believe our success depends on our employees’ success and that all employees must have the skills they need to thrive. We offer training and elective courses that give employees the opportunity to enhance their skills. We also intend to help cultivate the next generation of talent that will lead our company into the future by providing employees with educational opportunities through our internal training organization.\nLabor Contracts\n Approximately 43% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions. After expiration of collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached. The main contract set to expire in 2025 covers approximately 9,000 employees in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas and is set to expire in April.\nCompensation and Benefits\n In addition to salaries, we provide a variety of benefit programs to help meet the needs of our employees. These programs cover active and former employees and may vary by subsidiary and region. These programs include 401(k) plans, pension benefits, and health and welfare benefits, among many others. In addition to our active employee base, at December 31, 2024, we had approximately 496,000 retirees and dependents who were eligible to receive retiree benefits.\nWe review our benefit plans to maintain competitive packages that reflect the needs of our workforce. We also adapt our compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices across our business. We are committed to pay equity for employees who hold the same jobs, work in the same geographic area, and have the same levels of experience and performance.\nEmployee Wellness\n We provide our employees access to flexible and convenient health and welfare programs and workplace accommodations. We have prioritized self-care and emphasized a focus on wellness and providing flexible scheduling or time-off options.\nInclusion\n We believe that championing inclusion does more than just make us a better company, it contributes to a world where people are empowered to be their very best and it leads to a workforce that is representative of, and responsive to, the broad customer base that we serve. That is why we are committed to inclusion and one of the reasons why our company purpose is “to connect people to greater possibilities.” This emanates from our unwavering pledge to ensure that employees feel included when they join AT&T, and are provided with opportunities for advancement, training and development to realize their full potential while working for the company.\nWe believe in attracting and hiring talented people who represent a mix of backgrounds and experiences. At AT&T, we have employee groups that reflect our large and varied workforce. These affinity groups provide opportunities for professional enrichment, leadership, community engagement, market development and networking. It is important that our employees feel they are included, valued, and are fully engaged in our success.",

The increase in 2024 was primarily due to a third-quarter noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4,422 associated with our Business Wireline reporting unit. We performed an interim goodwill impairment test of the Business Wireline reporting unit and concluded that the calculated fair value was lower than the book value, which was driven by a faster-than-previously anticipated industry-wide secular decline of legacy services (see Note 9). Noncash charges in 2024 also included restructuring charges, including termination fees associated with our network modernization program to deploy commercial scale open radio access network (Open RAN).\nNoncash charges in 2023 primarily relate to severance and restructuring charges, as well as the abandonment of non-deployed wireless equipment associated with our Open RAN network modernization program. \nDepreciation and amortization \nexpense increased in 2024, primarily due to the shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless network equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our Open RAN network modernization efforts. Also contributing to higher depreciation expense was the impact of ongoing capital spending for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades. \nOperating income\n decreased in 2024 and increased in 2023. Our operating margin was 15.6% in 2024, compared to 19.2% in 2023, and (3.8)% in 2022, which included noncash goodwill impairment charges of $24,812.\nInterest expense \nincreased\n \nin 2024, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with spectrum acquisitions, mostly offset by lower debt balances. Interest expense in 2023 also includes distributions on Mobility preferred interests, which were repurchased on April 5, 2023 (see Note 16). \n21\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nEquity in net income of affiliates \nincreased in 2024. The increase reflects cash distributions received by AT&T in excess of the carrying amount of our investment in DIRECTV, partially offset by the performance of our investment in DIRECTV (see Notes 10 and 19).\nOther income (expense) – net \nincreased in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by actuarial remeasurement of benefit plan assets and obligations, with an actuarial loss of $56 in 2024, compared to net actuarial and settlement losses of $1,594 in 2023 (see Note 14). Also contributing to the increase was the prior-year write-down of our SKY Mexico equity investment. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments.\nIncome tax expense \nincreased in 2024. While our income before income taxes decreased in 2024, it includes a goodwill impairment associated with our Business Wireline reporting unit, which is not deductible for tax purposes and results in a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 26.6% in 2024, 21.3% in 2023, and (122.2)% in 2022. The effective tax rate in 2022 was also impacted by goodwill impairments, which are not deductible for tax purposes.\nSegment Results \nOur segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We evaluate segment performance based on operating income as well as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. See “Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nCOMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT\nPercent Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs.\n2023\n2023 vs.\n2022\nSegment Operating Revenues\nMobility\n$\n85,255\n \n$\n83,982 \n$\n81,780 \n1.5\n \n %\n2.7 \n %\nBusiness Wireline\n18,819\n \n20,883 \n22,538 \n(9.9)\n(7.3)\nConsumer Wireline\n13,578\n \n13,173 \n12,749 \n3.1\n \n3.3 \nTotal Segment Operating Revenues\n$\n117,652\n \n$\n118,038 \n$\n117,067 \n(0.3)\n%\n0.8 \n%\nSegment Operating Income (Loss)\nMobility\n$\n26,314\n \n$\n25,861 \n$\n23,812 \n1.8\n \n%\n8.6 \n%\nBusiness Wireline\n(88)\n1,289 \n2,290 \n—\n \n(43.7)\nConsumer Wireline\n869\n \n651 \n634 \n33.5\n \n2.7 \nTotal Segment Operating Income\n$\n27,095\n \n$\n27,801 \n$\n26,736 \n(2.5)\n %\n4.0 \n %\nOperating revenues \ndecreased in 2024, driven by declines in our Business Wireline business unit, which reflects lower demand for legacy services and product simplification, as well as the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to a new cybersecurity joint venture, LevelBlue, in the second quarter of 2024.

We believe that our simplified go-to-market strategy for 5G in underpenetrated markets will continue to contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that expansion of our fiber footprint and our multi-gig offerings will drive greater demand for broadband services on our fast-growing fiber network, as well as increasing our converged customers that have both wireless and fiber.\nAs we expand our fiber reach, we will be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity to offset continuing declines in legacy Business Wireline products by growing connectivity with small to mid-sized businesses. We plan to use our strong fiber and wireless assets, broad distribution and integrated product offerings to strengthen our overall market position. We will continue to rationalize our product portfolio with a longer-term shift of the business to fiber and mobile connectivity, and growth in value-added services. As customers are demanding faster and more reliable services, we are decommissioning our legacy copper network and enhancing our offerings to include services that provide better experiences over new technologies, such as AT&T Internet Air. \n2025 Expense Trends \nDuring 2025, we expect expense trends consistent with the prior year, and that we will continue to focus on efficiency, led by our cost transformation initiative. We expect the spending required to support growth and efficiency initiatives, primarily our continued deployment of fiber and 5G, to pressure expense trends in 2025. These investments will help prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming, augmented reality, “smart” technologies, user generated content and artificial intelligence (AI). The software benefits of our 5G wireless technology should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. Furthermore, to the extent customers upgrade their handsets in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\nWe continue to transform our operations to be more efficient and effective. We are restructuring businesses, working with regulators and customers to sunset legacy networks, improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation, sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels, and reassessing overall benefit costs. We also expect cost savings through AI-driven efficiencies in our network design and operations, software development, sales, marketing, customer support services and general and administrative costs.\nMarket Conditions \nIn recent years, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates, inflation and an increasing interest rate environment continued to produce volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. We expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2025 as we respond to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and our competitive marketplace, especially in wireless services.\nIncluded on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits. Our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). We expect only minimal ERISA contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2025. Investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans. In addition, our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions; however, these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in “Other income (expense) – net.” Changes in our discount rate, which are tied to changes in the bond market, and changes in the performance of equity markets, may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2025 (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”).\nExpected Growth Areas \nOver the next few years, we expect our growth to come from wireless and IP-based fiber broadband services. We provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the U.S. on a converged telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms. In 2025, our key initiatives include:\n•\nContinuing our wireless subscriber momentum and 5G deployment, with expansion of wireless subscribers in underpenetrated markets and converged customers.\n•\nContinuing our fiber deployment, improving fiber penetration, growing AT&T Internet Air services, accelerating subscriber growth and increasing broadband revenues.\n•\nDeploying Open RAN to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, fostering lower network costs, improved operational efficiencies and allowing for continued investment in our fast-growing broadband network.\n•\nContinuing to drive efficiencies and a competitive advantage through cost transformation initiatives and product simplification. \n27\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nWireless\n \nWe expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years. We are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video and data usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for next-generation integrated services that combine technologies and services. As of December 31, 2024, we served 141 million wireless subscribers in North America, with 118 million in the United States. \nOur LTE technology covers over 440 million people in North America, and in the United States, we cover all major metropolitan areas and over 336 million people. When combined with our upgraded backhaul network, we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services. In December 2018, we introduced the nation’s first commercial mobile 5G service and expanded that deployment nationwide in July 2020. At December 31, 2024, our network covers more than 314 million people with 5G technology in the United States and North America.\nOur networks covering both the U.S. and Mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies’ networks. We believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity. At December 31, 2024, we provided LTE coverage to over 104 million people in Mexico.\nIntegration of Wireless and Fiber Services \nThe communications industry has evolved into internet-based technologies capable of converging the offering of wireline and wireless services. As the owner and operator of scaled wireless and fiber networks, we plan to continue to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and providing broadband offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with their mobile service. In January 2022, we launched our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest internet to AT&T Fiber customers in select locations with symmetrical 2 gig and 5 gig tiers. We intend to continue to develop and provide unique integrated mobile and broadband/fiber solutions.\nREGULATORY LANDSCAPE\nAT&T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. While these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries, the words “we,” “AT&T” and “our” are used to simplify the discussion. The following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues.\nInternational Regulation \nOur subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate. Our licensing, compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise (i.e., large business) services globally and wireless services in Mexico.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in Europe in May of 2018. This regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance. AT&T processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers, employees of its enterprise customers and its employees.\nU.S. Regulation \nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), Congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. Nonetheless, since then, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained, re-imposed or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. Recently, the FCC’s regulatory approach has depended on control of the executive branch, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations in a number of areas, while imposing or re-imposing regulations in other areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition. We have organized the following discussion by service impacted.\nInternet\n Until 2015, the FCC classified fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as information services subject to minimal regulation. In 2015, the FCC reclassified such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC and imposed “net neutrality rules.” Since then, the FCC has twice reversed course, most recently again reclassifying such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC in an order adopted on April 25, 2024. Multiple trade associations and other parties challenged the FCC’s reclassification decision in appeals consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The trade associations petitioned the Sixth Circuit to stay the FCC’s order. On August 1, 2024, the Sixth Circuit issued a stay of the FCC order pending review of the appeals, holding that broadband providers are likely to succeed on the merits. On January 2, 2025, the Sixth Circuit issued an order granting the petition for review and setting aside the FCC net neutrality order, holding that broadband internet access service is an information service.\n28\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nAt least one state has adopted legislation regulating the rates of fixed broadband service. In 2021, New York enacted the Affordable Broadband Act (ABA), requiring ISPs offering “fixed” mass-market broadband service, including fixed wireless, to offer discounted plans to low-income customers. In June 2021, the ABA was enjoined by a federal district court, which found the ABA preempted by federal law. In April 2024, the Second Circuit overruled and vacated the district court order. In August 2024, trade associations asked the Supreme Court to review the Second Circuit’s decision. On December 16, the Supreme Court issued an order denying the request. Those associations have since requested rehearing of that Supreme Court decision.\n \nUnder an agreement with the New York Attorney General, the law began to be enforced on January 15, 2025. In response, AT&T announced that it would no longer offer its AT&T Internet Air fixed wireless service in New York. Other states could consider similar legislation.\nSince 2018, some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that established state net neutrality rules, including California and Vermont. We expect additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements in the future.\nOn November 15, 2023, the FCC adopted rules to “facilitate” equal access to broadband and prevent digital discrimination in broadband access. The rules, which became effective March 22, 2024, prohibit covered entities from implementing policies or practices not justified by genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility, that differentially impact consumers’ access to broadband internet access service based on prohibited characteristics (including income level, race, and ethnicity) or that have such differential impact, whether intentional or not. The rules broadly apply prospectively to all aspects of an ISP’s service that could impact a consumer’s ability to access broadband, including deployment, marketing, and credit checks, among other things. We may be required to answer complaints alleging that the company has violated the FCC rules and those complaints may seek relief, including changes to our business practices or civil forfeitures that could result in significant costs or reputational harm. It is currently uncertain how the FCC will implement and enforce these new rules. Several business associations have filed appeals challenging the rules and several of those appeals have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit, which held oral argument on September 25, 2024. \nPrivacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative, regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance, further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data.\nInfrastructure Investment \nOn November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law. The legislation appropriates $65,000 to support broadband deployment and adoption. The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) is responsible for distributing more than $48,000 of this funding, including $42,500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas through the Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Programs. NTIA and states are in the process of administering these grants. Where appropriate, AT&T has applied for, and in some cases has been awarded, and may continue to apply for grants under this or other government infrastructure programs. \nWireless \nIndustry-wide network densification and 5G technology expansion efforts, which are needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access, will involve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment. This increases the importance of local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment in the public right-of-way on reasonable timelines and terms. The FCC has adopted multiple Orders streamlining federal, state, and local wireless structure review processes that had the tendency to delay and impede deployment of small cell and related infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services. Additional spectrum will be needed industrywide for 5G and future services. In 2023, the FCC’s statutory authority to conduct spectrum auctions lapsed and it is uncertain when Congress will reauthorize it. Also in 2023, the federal government released a national spectrum strategy that focused on spectrum sharing but did not include terms of future spectrum sharing model(s) or specific timelines to make additional spectrum bands available for 5G and future generations of service. As a result, the federal government’s ability and intent to make sufficient spectrum available to the industry in needed timeframes and on terms suitable for mobile broadband network deployments remains uncertain. \nIn June and November 2020, the FCC issued Declaratory Rulings clarifying the limits on state and local authority to deny applications to modify existing structures to accommodate wireless facilities. In September 2024, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals resolved challenges to those Declaratory Rulings, largely sustaining the FCC’s rulings. The decision ensures that the FCC retains the ability to remove state and local regulations that could delay or impede spectrum and technology upgrades on existing cell site facilities. \nIn recent years, the FCC took several actions to make spectrum available for 5G services, including the auction of 280 MHz of mid-band spectrum previously used for satellite service (the “C-Band” auction) and 39 GHz band spectrum. AT&T obtained spectrum in these auctions. The FCC also made 150 MHz of mid-band CBRS spectrum available, to be shared with Federal incumbents, which enjoy priority. In addition, in 2022, the FCC completed Auction 110, in which AT&T won 40 MHz of 3.45 GHz spectrum nationwide at a cost of $9,079. (See Note 6)\n29\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nBecause of the size of the financial statement line items they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits \nOur actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weighted-average assumptions are discussed in Note 14. Our assumed weighted-average discount rates for pension and postretirement benefits of 5.70% and 5.60%, respectively, at December 31, 2024, reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations. These bonds had an average rating of at least Aa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, and generally not callable, convertible or index linked. For the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, we increased our pension discount rate by 0.70%, resulting in a decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of $1,994, and increased our postretirement discount rate by 0.60%, resulting in a decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of $317.\nOur expected long-term rate of return is 7.75% on pension plan assets and 4.00% on postretirement plan assets for 2024 and 2025. Our expected return on plan assets is calculated using the actual fair value of plan assets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a 0.50% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would cause 2025 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase $136, which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns in the current year upon remeasurement of our retiree benefit plans.\nWe recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in “Other income (expense) – net” in our consolidated statements of income. These gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31, and accordingly, will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required. Should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions, the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years. See Note 14 for additional discussions regarding our assumptions.\nAsset Valuations and Impairments \nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested at least annually on October 1 for impairment. For impairment testing, we estimate fair values using models that predominantly rely on the expected cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit or use of the asset. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life. Inputs underlying the expected cash flows include, but are not limited to, subscriber counts, revenue per user, capital investment and acquisition costs per subscriber, and ongoing operating costs. We based our assumptions on a combination of our historical results, trends, business plans and marketplace participant data.\nAnnual Goodwill Testing\nGoodwill is tested on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. We estimate fair values using an income approach (also known as a discounted cash flow model) and market multiple approaches. The income approach utilizes our future cash flow projections with a perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. The market multiple approach uses the multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to those offered by the reporting units.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we updated the long-term strategic plan of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The updated plans reflected lower long-term projected future cash flows associated with the industry-wide secular decline, including a faster-than-previously anticipated decline of legacy services. We identified this as an impairment indicator and performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The interim impairment test methodology was consistent with our approach for annual impairment testing (see Note 1), using similar models updated with our current view of key inputs and assumptions. We concluded that the calculated fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit was lower than the book value, resulting in a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4,422 for the entirety of our Business Wireline reporting unit goodwill.\nAs of October 1, 2024, the calculated fair values of the reporting units with remaining goodwill exceeded their book values in all circumstances in excess of 10%. If either the projected long-term growth rates declined by 0.5%, if the projected long-term \n30\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nEBITDA margin declined by 0.5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 0.5%, the fair values would still be higher than the book value of the reporting units.\nThe fair values of our remaining reporting units could be negatively impacted by future sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions, higher discount rates or declines in the value of AT&T stock and could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. \nU.S. Wireless Licenses\nThe fair value of U.S. wireless licenses is assessed using a discounted cash flow model (the Greenfield Approach) and a qualitative corroborative market approach based on auction prices, depending upon auction activity. The Greenfield Approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. These licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis, consistent with their use on a national scope for the United States. For impairment testing, we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels, with a long-term growth rate reflecting expected long-term inflation trends. We assume churn rates will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rates that are in line with industry-leading churn. We used a discount rate of 8.75%, based on the optimal long-term capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses, to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows. If either the projected rate of long-term growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%, or if the discount rate increased by 0.5%, the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value. The fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10%.\nIncome Taxes \nOur estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 13 and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities.\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 for discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting standards.\nOTHER BUSINESS MATTERS \nEnvironmental \nWe are subject from time to time to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under federal, state or local environmental laws. We reference in our Forms 10-Q and 10-K certain environmental proceedings that could result in monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) of three hundred thousand dollars or more. However, we do not believe that any of those currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nContinuing operations for the years ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n38,771\n \n$\n38,314 \n$\n35,812 \nCash used in investing activities\n(17,490)\n(19,660)\n(26,899)\nCash used in financing activities\n(24,708)\n(15,614)\n(59,564)\nAt December 31, \n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n3,298\n \n$\n6,722 \nTotal debt\n123,532\n \n137,331 \nWe had $3,298 in cash and cash equivalents available at December 31, 2024, decreasing $3,424 since December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents included cash of $2,149 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of $1,149. Approximately $1,268 of our cash and cash equivalents were held in accounts outside of the U.S. and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation. \n31\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nIn 2024, cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations, including cash from our sale and transfer of our receivables to third parties, distributions from DIRECTV and sales of idle Rabbi Trust assets and other investments. These inflows were exceeded by cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses. The cash generated\n \nfrom operating activities was used to fund capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, repay short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and dividend payments to stockholders. We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\nRefer to “Contractual Obligations” discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations \nDuring 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $38,771, compared to $38,314 in 2023, reflecting the timing of working capital associated with device payments, as well as the expansion of committed, cost-efficient receivable sales programs, and operational growth, partially offset by higher cash tax payments.\nWe actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost (referred to as supplier financing program). In addition, for payments to suppliers of handset inventory, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as direct supplier financing). The net impact of direct supplier financing, including principal and interest payments, was to improve cash from operating activities $661 in 2024 and decrease cash from operating activities $299 in 2023. All supplier financing payments are due within one year. (See Note 22)\nCash Used in Investing Activities from Continuing Operations\nDuring 2024, cash used in investing activities totaled $17,490, consisting primarily of $20,263 (including interest during construction) for capital expenditures. During 2024, net FirstNet sustainability payments were $237. In 2024, we received a return of investment of $928 from DIRECTV representing distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from DIRECTV (see Note 10) and sold Rabbi Trust and other investments totaling $2,575.\nFor capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Vendor financing payments were $1,792 in 2024, compared to $5,742 in 2023. Capital expenditures in 2024 were $20,263, and when including $1,792 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $22,055 ($1,540 lower than the prior year).\nThe vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. In 2024, we placed $700 of productive assets (primarily software) in service under vendor financing arrangements (compared to $2,651 in 2023).\nThe amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. In 2025, we expect that our capital investment, which includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing, will be in the $22,000 range.\nCash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations \nIn 2024, cash used in financing activities totaled $24,708 and was comprised of debt repayments, payments of dividends and vendor financing payments.\nA tabular summary of our debt activity during 2024 is as follows:\nFirst\nQuarter\nSecond \nQuarter\nThird\nQuarter\nFourth\nQuarter\nFull Year 2024\nNet commercial paper borrowings\n$\n428 \n$\n262 \n$\n(2,686)\n$\n— \n$\n(1,996)\nRepayments:\nUSD notes\n$\n(2,300)\n$\n(1,615)\n$\n— \n$\n(2,575)\n$\n(6,490)\nEUR notes\n(2,181)\n(32)\n— \n— \n(2,213)\nCAD notes\n— \n(442)\n— \n— \n(442)\nCHF notes\n— \n— \n— \n(467)\n(467)\nOther\n(204)\n(136)\n(203)\n(142)\n(685)\nRepayments of long-term debt\n$\n(4,685)\n$\n(2,225)\n$\n(203)\n$\n(3,184)\n$\n(10,297)\n32\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe weighted average interest rate of our long-term debt portfolio, including credit agreement borrowings and the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.2% as of December 31, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. We had $122,116 of total notes and debentures outstanding at December 31, 2024. This also included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and Australian dollar denominated debt that totaled approximately $30,685.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $5,089 of long-term debt maturing within one year. We had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings or other short-term borrowings on December 31, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 6.0% as of December 31, 2023.\nDuring 2024, we paid $1,792 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to $5,742 in 2023. Total vendor financing payables included in our December 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet were $1,448, with $749 due within one year (in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”) and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in “Other noncurrent liabilities”).\nIn December 2024, our Board of Directors approved a $10,000 share repurchase authorization and terminated the March 2014 authorization, under which approximately 144 million shares were available for repurchase. At December 31, 2024, we had $10,000 remaining from our common stock repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in December 2024.\nWe paid dividends on common and preferred shares of $8,208 in 2024, compared with $8,136 in 2023. Dividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors totaled $1.11 per share in 2024 and in 2023. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&T and long-term growth opportunities.\nOur 2025 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and repurchasing common stock when deemed appropriate. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.\nCredit Facilities\nThe following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. We currently have a $12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2029 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\nWe also utilize other external financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.\nCollateral Arrangements\nMost of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our $34,884 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During 2024, we received $477 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 12)\nOther\nOur total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year), redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders’ equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At December 31, 2024, our debt ratio was 50.7%, compared to 53.5% at December 31, 2023 and 56.1% at December 31, 2022. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests.\n33\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nA significant amount of our cash outflows for continuing operations is related to tax items, acquisition of spectrum through FCC auctions and benefits paid for current and former employees:\n•\nTotal taxes incurred, collected and remitted by AT&T during 2024 and 2023 were $16,968 and $16,877. These taxes include income, franchise, property, sales, excise, payroll, gross receipts and various other taxes and fees. \n•\nTotal domestic spectrum acquired primarily through FCC auctions, including cash, exchanged spectrum, auction deposits and spectrum relocation and clearing costs, was approximately $380 in 2024, $2,940 in 2023 and $10,200 in 2022.\n•\nTotal health and welfare benefits provided to certain active and retired employees and their dependents totaled approximately $2,550 in 2024 and $2,990 in 2023, with $736 paid from plan assets in 2024, compared to $624 in 2023. Of those benefits, approximately $2,290 related to medical and prescription drug benefits in 2024, compared to $2,730 in 2023. We paid $2,447 of pension benefits out of plan assets in 2024, compared to $4,863 in 2023.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024, and the estimated timing of payment, are in the following table:\nPayments Due By Period\nTotal\nLess than\n1 Year\n1-3\nYears\n3-5\nYears\nMore than\n5 Years\nLong-term debt obligations\n1\n$\n135,952 \n$\n5,399 \n$\n14,962 \n$\n13,823 \n$\n101,768 \nInterest payments on long-term debt\n2\n90,504 \n5,549 \n10,300 \n9,326 \n65,329 \nPurchase obligations\n3\n \n27,997 \n9,916 \n10,982 \n5,495 \n1,604 \nOperating lease obligations\n4\n25,475 \n4,789 \n7,693 \n5,015 \n7,978 \nFirstNet sustainability payments\n5\n16,449 \n420 \n2,462 \n3,132 \n10,435 \nUnrecognized tax benefits (UTB)\n6\n9,912 \n245 \n— \n— \n9,667 \nOther finance obligations\n7\n8,802 \n1,522 \n2,039 \n1,566 \n3,675 \nTotal Contractual Obligations\n$\n315,091 \n$\n27,840 \n$\n48,438 \n$\n38,357 \n$\n200,456 \n1\nRepresents principal or payoff amounts of notes, debentures and credit agreement borrowings at maturity (see Note 11). Foreign debt includes the impact from hedges, when applicable.\n2\nIncludes credit agreement borrowings.\n3\nWe expect to fund the purchase obligations with cash provided by operations or through incremental borrowings. The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. (See Note 21)\n4\nRepresents operating lease payments (see Note 8).\n5\nRepresents contractual commitment to make sustainability payments over the 25-year contract. These sustainability payments represent our commitment to fund FirstNet’s operating expenses and future reinvestment in the network, which we own and operate. FirstNet has a statutory requirement to reinvest funds that exceed the agency’s operating expenses, which we anticipate to be $15,000. (See Note 20)\n6\nThe noncurrent portion of the UTBs is included in the “More than 5 Years” column, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments, if any, at this time (see Note 13).\n7\nRepresents future minimum payments under the Crown Castle and other arrangements (see Note 18), payables subject to extended payment terms (see Note 22) and finance lease payments (see Note 8).\nCertain items were excluded from this table because the year of payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated, we believe the obligations are immaterial, or the settlement of the obligation will not require the use of cash. These items include: deferred income tax liability of $58,939 (see Note 13); net postemployment benefit obligations of $9,595 (including current portion); and other noncurrent liabilities of $8,292.\n34\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nDISCUSSION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nWe also evaluate segment and business unit performance based on EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as EBITDA divided by total revenue. EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting, and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and EBITDA margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommunications Segment\nOperating income\n$\n27,095\n \n$\n27,801 \n$\n26,736 \nAdd: Depreciation and amortization expense\n19,433\n \n17,363 \n16,681 \nEBITDA\n$\n46,528\n \n$\n45,164 \n$\n43,417 \nOperating income margin\n23.0\n \n%\n23.6 \n%\n22.8 \n%\nEBITDA margin\n39.5\n \n%\n38.3 \n%\n37.1 \n%\nMobility\nOperating income\n$\n26,314\n \n$\n25,861 \n$\n23,812 \nAdd: Depreciation and amortization expense\n10,217\n \n8,517 \n8,198 \nEBITDA\n$\n36,531\n \n$\n34,378 \n$\n32,010 \nOperating income margin\n30.9\n \n%\n30.8 \n%\n29.1 \n%\nEBITDA margin\n42.8\n \n%\n40.9 \n%\n39.1 \n%\nBusiness Wireline\nOperating income\n$\n(88)\n$\n1,289 \n$\n2,290 \nAdd: Depreciation and amortization expense\n5,555\n \n5,377 \n5,314 \nEBITDA\n$\n5,467\n \n$\n6,666 \n$\n7,604 \nOperating income margin\n(0.5)\n%\n6.2 \n%\n10.2 \n%\nEBITDA margin\n29.1\n \n%\n31.9 \n%\n33.7 \n%\nConsumer Wireline\nOperating income\n$\n869\n \n$\n651 \n$\n634 \nAdd: Depreciation and amortization expense\n3,661\n \n3,469 \n3,169 \nEBITDA\n$\n4,530\n \n$\n4,120 \n$\n3,803 \nOperating income margin\n6.4\n \n%\n4.9 \n%\n5.0 \n%\nEBITDA margin\n33.4\n \n%\n31.3 \n%\n29.8 \n%\nLatin America Segment\nOperating income\n$\n40\n \n$\n(141)\n$\n(326)\nAdd: Depreciation and amortization expense\n657\n \n724 \n658 \nEBITDA\n$\n697\n \n$\n583 \n$\n332 \nOperating income margin\n0.9\n \n%\n(3.6)\n%\n(10.4)\n%\nEBITDA margin\n16.5\n \n%\n14.8 \n%\n10.6 \n%\n35\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts",
