MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOverview\nUnited Airlines Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, \"UAL\" or the \"Company\") is a holding company incorporated in Delaware and its wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, \"United\").\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is a combined report of UAL and United, including their respective consolidated financial statements. As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United comprises substantially all of UAL's operating revenues, operating expenses, assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures, and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" and the \"Company\" in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.\nOur shared purpose is \"Connecting People. Uniting the World.\" We have the most comprehensive route network among North American carriers, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations, which utilize jet aircraft with at least 126 seats, and regional operations, which utilize smaller aircraft that are operated under contract by United's regional carriers. The Company serves virtually every major market around the world, either directly or through participation in Star Alliance\n®\n, the world's largest airline alliance network.\nOur current expectations described below are forward-looking statements and our actual results and timing may vary materially based on various factors that include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under \"Economic and Market Factors,\" \"Governmental Actions\" and \"Forward-Looking Information\" and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (the \"2024 Form 10-K\"). The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\nEconomic and Market Factors\nThe airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, airline capacity, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. We, like other companies in our industry, have been subject to these and other industry-specific competitive dynamics. In addition, our operations, supply chain, partners and suppliers have been subject to various global macroeconomic factors. We expect to continue to remain vulnerable to a number of industry-specific and global macroeconomic factors that may cause our actual results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations or current expectations. The economic and market factors and trends that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: the execution and effect of our business strategies, including our United Next plan, especially relating to our focus on expanding market and product opportunities and the growth in the scale of our operations; the impact on the Company of significant operational challenges by third parties on which we rely; aircraft delivery delays; rising inflationary pressures; labor market and supply chain constraints and related costs affecting us and our partners; volatile fuel prices; increasing maintenance expenses; changes in interest rates; changes in travel patterns; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates, including an economic downturn or macroeconomic uncertainty leading to a decrease in demand for air travel or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may impact international travel demand. We continue to monitor the potential favorable or unfavorable impacts of these and other factors on our business, operations, financial condition, future results of operations, liquidity and financial flexibility, which are dependent on future developments, including as a result of those factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of the 2024 Form 10-K. Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility and our growth plans may be delayed, particularly in the short term, due to the impact of the above factors and trends.\n21\nTable of Contents\nGovernmental Actions\nWe operate in complex, highly regulated environments in the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom and other regions around the world. Compliance with laws, regulations, administrative practices and other restrictions or legal requirements in the countries in which we do business is onerous and expensive. In addition, changes to existing legal requirements or the implementation of new legal requirements and any failure to comply with such legal requirements could negatively impact our business, operations, financial condition, future results of operations, liquidity and financial flexibility by increasing the Company's costs, limiting the Company's ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company's products and services and requiring changes to the Company's supply chain and its business. Legal requirements that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: the closure of our flying airspace and termination of other operations due to regional conflicts, including the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and interruptions of our flying as a result of the military conflicts in the Middle East, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of any conflicts beyond their current scope; delays in aircraft certification (especially relating to the 737 MAX 10 aircraft); increased Federal Aviation Administration oversight of the aircraft production process; any legal requirement that would result in a reshaping of the benefits that we provide to our consumers through our loyalty program or the co-branded credit cards issued by our partner; the effect of trade tariffs and any potential changes to them that we are unable to mitigate; and certain rules and regulations proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation that would impose additional costs and operational restrictions on airlines. Changes in existing applicable legal requirements or new applicable legal requirements as well as the related interpretations and enforcement practices regarding them, create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be understood and applied. As a result, the impact of changing and new legal requirements generally cannot be reasonably predicted and those requirements may ultimately require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and reasons for material changes therein for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period in 2024.\nThird Quarter 2025 Compared to Third Quarter

million, or 15.7%, in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to rate increases at various airports and higher landed weight volume due to increased flight activity.\nRegional capacity purchase increased $35 million, or 5.3%, in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an approximately 10% increase in regional flying activity.\nFor details on the Company's Special charges, see Note 10 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nOther operating expenses increased $242 million, or 10.5%, in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in flying activity and on-board passengers, including increased costs for onboard catering, ground handling and passenger services, crew-related expenses, as well as expenditures related to information technology projects and services.\nNonoperating Income (Expense\n). \nThe table below shows

debt.\nInterest income decreased $45 million, or 23.9%, in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower interest rates and slightly lower levels of cash and short-term investments.\n24\nTable of Contents\nUnrealized losses on investments, net, were $13 million in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $90 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to changes in the market value of the Company's investments in equity securities. See Note 7 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information related to these equity investments.\nMiscellaneous, net, changed by $59 million in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to $75 million of debt extinguishment and modification fees in the year-ago period as compared to $20 million in the third quarter of 2025.\nIncome Taxes.\n \nSee Note 5 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information related to income taxes.\nFirst Nine Months 2025 Compared to First Nine Months 2024 \nThe Company recorded net income of $2.3 billion in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to net income of $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024.

groups.\nAircraft fuel expense decreased $607 million, or 6.7%, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to a lower average price per gallon of fuel, partially offset by increased consumption from increased flying activity.\nLanding fees and other rent increased $300 million, or 11.8%, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to rate increases at various airports, terminal expansions and other increases in the number of airport gates, and higher landed weight volume due to increased flight activity.\nAircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $120 million, or 5.3%, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to engine overhauls and component part repairs driven by higher volumes and cost of materials.\n26\nTable of Contents\nRegional capacity purchase increased $164 million, or 8.9%, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an approximately 12% increase in regional flying activity.\nDistribution expenses decreased $142 million, or 8.4%, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to a change in the mix of sales channels as well as the refinement of assumptions used in determining our credit card fees expense.\nFor details on the Company's Special charges, see Note 10 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nOther operating expenses increased $696 million, or 10.4%, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in flying activity and on-board passengers, including increased costs for onboard catering and amenities, ground and cargo handling, airport lounge operations and passenger services, crew-related expenses, as well as expenditures related to employee uniforms and information technology projects and services.\nNonoperating Income (Expense).\n \nThe following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the Company's nonoperating income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30 (in

as a result of various debt prepayments and scheduled amortization and a reduction in the average cost of debt.\nInterest income decreased $81 million, or 14.6%, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower interest rates and slightly lower levels of cash and short-term investments.\nUnrealized losses on investments, net, were $8 million in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to $160 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to the change in the market value of the Company's investments in equity securities. See Note 7 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information related to these equity investments.\nMiscellaneous, net, changed by $126 million in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to $110 million of debt extinguishment and modification fees in the year-ago period as compared to $20 million in the first nine months of 2025, foreign exchange gains recorded in the current period as compared to losses in the year-ago-period and an increase in the benefit from the Company's net periodic benefit cost of its pensions and postretirement benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes. \nSee Note 5 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information related to income taxes.\n LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Liquidity\nWe deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, including returns to shareholders through potential share repurchases. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $13.3 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $14.5 billion at December 31, 2024. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity needs for the next 12 months, and we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with our anticipated access to the capital markets and projected cash from operations.\nThe Company has a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2025. The revolving credit facility is secured by certain route authorities and airport slots and gates. No borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2025.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOn July 7, 2025, Mileage Plus Holdings, LLC (\"MPH\"), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of United, and Mileage Plus Intellectual Property Assets, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of MPH (\"MIPA\" and, together with MPH, the \"Issuers\"), redeemed in full (the \"Redemption\") all $1.52 billion aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' outstanding MileagePlus 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027 (the \"MileagePlus Notes\"), which were secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuers and their subsidiaries.

However, aircraft deliveries are subject to a number of variables, as further described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2024 Form 10-K, and we cannot guarantee delivery of any particular aircraft at any specific time notwithstanding firm purchase commitments.\nThe aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery through 2033. The amount and timing of the Company's future capital commitments could change to the extent that: (i) the Company and the aircraft manufacturers, with whom the Company has existing orders for new aircraft, agree to modify (or further modify) the contracts governing those orders; (ii) rights are exercised pursuant to the relevant agreements to cancel deliveries or modify the timing of deliveries; or (iii) the aircraft manufacturers are unable to deliver in accordance with the terms of those orders. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on these purchase commitments. \n28\nTable of Contents\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30 (in millions):\n2025\n2024\nIncrease (Decrease)\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n7,145 \n$\n7,221 \n$\n(76)\nInvesting activities\n(4,785)\n(936)\n3,849 \nFinancing activities\n(4,436)\n(3,591)\n845 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(2,075)\n$\n2,694 \n$\n(4,769)\nOperating Activities.\n \nCash flows provided by operating activities decreased approximately $76 million in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower operating income in the first nine months of 2025.\nInvesting Activities.\n \nCash flows used in investing activities increased $3.8 billion in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in the purchase of short-term and other investments as well as a decrease in proceeds from the sale of short-term and other investments.\nFinancing Activities.\n Significant financing events in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were as follows:\nDebt, Finance Lease and Other Financial Liability Principal Payments\n. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company made payments for debt, finance leases, and other financial liabilities of $4.2 billion.\nShare repurchase. \nAs part of our capital deployment program, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in October 2024. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company repurchased, through open market purchases, approximately 0.2 million and 7.8 million shares, respectively, of UAL common stock for a total of approximately $19 million and $612 million, respectively, as part of its share repurchase program. See Note 3 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 3 to the financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the share repurchase program.\nCredit Ratings.\n As of the filing date of this report, UAL and United had the following corporate credit ratings:\nS&P\nMoody's\nFitch\nUAL\nBB+\nBa2\nBB\nUnited\nBB+\n*\nBB\n*The credit agency does not issue corporate credit ratings for subsidiary entities. \nThe Company has been able to secure financing with investment grade credit ratings for certain enhanced equipment trust certificates (\"EETCs\"), term loans and secured bond financings. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of future financing for the Company as well as affect the fair market value of existing debt. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Currently, Moody's and Fitch have assigned the Company a positive outlook, while S&P maintains a stable outlook.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Liquidity Matters. \nAs described in the 2024 Form 10-K, the Company's liquidity may be adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, pension funding obligations, reserve requirements associated with credit card processing agreements, guarantees, commitments and contingencies.\nSee the 2024 Form 10-K and Notes 7, 8 and 9 to the financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSee \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2024 Form 10-K.\n29\nTable of Contents\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis report contains certain \"forward-looking statements,\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), including in Part I, Item 2.

Such forward-looking statements are based on historical performance and current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the Company's future financial results, goals, plans, commitments, strategies and objectives and involve inherent risks, assumptions and uncertainties, known or unknown, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, that are difficult to predict, may be beyond the Company's control and could cause the Company's future financial results, goals, plans, commitments, strategies and objectives to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the statements.

All statements, other than those that relate solely to historical facts, are forward-looking statements.\nAdditionally, forward-looking statements include conditional statements and statements that identify uncertainties or trends, discuss the possible future effects of known trends or uncertainties, or that indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information available to us on the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulation.\nOur actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without limitation, the following: execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan; changes in our fleet and network strategy or other factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders, costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or entry into aircraft orders on less favorable terms, as well as any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as planned, including as a result of any mandatory groundings of aircraft; any failure to effectively manage, and receive anticipated benefits and returns from, acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other portfolio actions, or related exposures to unknown liabilities or other issues or underperformance as compared to our expectations; adverse publicity, increased regulatory scrutiny, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and operational restrictions as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft, engines and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional network and United Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States and globally; reliance on third-party service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services; extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate and space, facility and infrastructure constraints at our hubs or other airports (including as a result of government shutdowns); geopolitical conflict, terrorist attacks or security events (including the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and interruptions of our flying as a result of the military conflicts in the Middle East, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of any conflicts beyond their current scope or a delay in any planned resumption of service to an area impacted by conflict); any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our business and the impact of any significant failure or disruption of, or failure to effectively integrate and implement, these technologies or systems; increasing privacy, data security and cybersecurity obligations or a significant data breach; increased use of social media platforms by us, our employees and others; the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our operations or financial performance; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or agreement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel; the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing our debt; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future \n30\nTable of Contents\ntaxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the price of our common stock; the impacts of seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry; increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage; risks relating to our repurchase program for UAL common stock and warrants; and other risks and uncertainties set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of our 2024 Form 10-K, and under \"Economic and Market Factors\" and \"Governmental Actions\" in Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report, as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC.\nThe foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections, beliefs and assumptions upon which we base our expectations may change. For instance, we regularly monitor future demand and booking trends and adjust capacity, as needed. As such, our actual flown capacity may differ materially from currently published flight schedules or current estimations.\n31\nTable of Contents"
