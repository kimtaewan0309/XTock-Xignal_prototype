The year end is December 31, 2024 unless additional years are included or noted.\nOverview\nFastenal Company (together with our subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as Fastenal or by terms such as we, our, or us) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. We opened our first branch in 1967 in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population today of approximately 26,000. We began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers through a branch network in small, medium, and, in subsequent years, large cities. Over time, how and where we engage our customers has expanded and evolved. Today we sell a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines through a global network of in-market locations utilizing diverse technologies such as vending devices, bin stock devices, and eBusiness. The large majority of our transactions are business-to-business. We provide additional descriptions of our product lines and market channels later in this document. At the end of 2024, we had 3,628 in-market locations (defined in the table below) in 25 countries supported by 15 distribution centers in North America, with 12 in the United States (U.S.), two in Canada, and one in Mexico; one in Asia; and two in Europe, and we employed 23,702 people. We believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers, and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement.\nOur Channels to Market\nWe engage our customers primarily through branch and Onsite locations. Branches and Onsites exist very close to our customers, usually within miles of, and often within or immediately proximate to, our customers' physical operations. Together, these constitute our 'in-market' network. Many of our customers engage with us through eBusiness, but in most cases these customers are utilizing eBusiness to supplement our service through our other channels.\n2\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows, as of the end of each of the last 10 fiscal years, our consolidated net sales; the number of branch, Onsite, and total in-market locations; their respective sales, as well as the average monthly sales per location that were generated from our branch and Onsite locations; and our sales generated from non-traditional sources:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\n2017\n2016\n2015\nNet sales\n$\n7,546.0\n \n7,346.7 \n6,980.6 \n6,010.9 \n5,647.3 \n5,333.7 \n4,965.1 \n4,390.5 \n3,962.0 \n3,869.2 \nBranch locations\n1,597\n \n1,597 \n1,683 \n1,793 \n2,003 \n2,114 \n2,227 \n2,383 \n2,503 \n2,622 \n    Branch sales \n(1)\n$\n4,109.3\n \n4,073.6 \n4,161.6 \n3,726.2 \n3,587.1 \n3,660.1 \n3,625.8 \n3,399.6 \n3,198.1 \n3,281.8 \n    Average monthly sales \nper branch location \n(2)\n$\n214.4\n \n207.0 \n199.5 \n163.6 \n145.2 \n140.5 \n131.1 \n116.0 \n104.0 \n104.0 \nOnsite locations \n2,031\n \n1,822 \n1,623 \n1,416 \n1,265 \n1,114 \n894 \n605 \n401 \n264 \n    Onsite sales \n(1)\n$\n3,201.6\n \n2,926.7 \n2,465.5 \n1,898.0 \n1,485.6 \n1,391.7 \n1,081.7 \n770.2 \n569.2 \n454.3 \n    Average monthly sales per Onsite location \n(2)\n$\n138.5\n \n141.6 \n135.2 \n118.0 \n104.1 \n115.5 \n120.3 \n127.6 \n142.7 \n158.4 \nOther sales \n(3)\n$\n235.1\n \n346.4 \n353.5 \n386.7 \n574.6 \n281.9 \n257.6 \n220.7 \n194.7 \n133.1 \nTotal in-market locations \n(4)\n3,628\n \n3,419 \n3,306 \n3,209 \n3,268 \n3,228 \n3,121 \n2,988 \n2,904 \n2,886 \n(1)\nSales attributable to our traditional and international branch locations (both of which are defined below), and our Onsite locations, respectively.\n(2)\nAverage sales per month considers the average active base of branches and Onsites, respectively, in the given year, factoring in the beginning and ending location count, divided by total sales attributable to our branch and Onsite locations, respectively, further divided by 12 months. This information is presented in thousands.\n(3)\nThis portion of sales is generated outside our traditional in-market locations, examples of which include sales arising from our custom in-house manufacturing, industrial services, and other non-traditional sources of sales. In 2020, this included the effects of COVID-19, one response to which was substantial sales of pandemic-related products that were direct-shipped (versus sold through in-market locations) as a means of delivering critical supplies more quickly.\n(4)\n'In-market locat\nions' is defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of Onsite locations.\nThis structure has evolved over time as a result of one of Fastenal's guiding principles since inception: that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer. This has been achieved by opening branch locations and, more recently, Onsite locations. Today, we believe there are few companies that offer our North American in-market location coverage. In 2024, roughly 53% of our sales and 50% of our in-market locations were in major Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) (populations in the U.S. and Canada greater than 500,000 people), while 21% of our sales and 20% of our in-market locations were in small MSAs (populations under 500,000 people), and 26% of our sales and 30% of our in-market locations were not in an MSA (populations under 50,000 people). In our view, this has proven to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis. Maintaining operations that are physically proximate to our customers' operations have represented, and continue to represent, the foundation of our service approach.\nThe distinctions between our branch and Onsite locations are as follows:\nBranch locations\n typically service a wide variety and number of customers, ranging from the local operations of large, national account customers to smaller local businesses. Locations are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network and employment and production data for manufacturing and non-residential construction companies. We stock all branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and tailored by our district and branch personnel to the needs of the local customer base. \nBased on the unique characteristics of certain markets and the judgement of local leadership, different branch types have emerged over time. In the United States and Canada, the most common type is the \nCustomer Fulfillment Center (CFC),\n which tends to feature a limited showroom and stock customer-specific inventory. These have the appearance of and function more like an industrial supply house and stocking location. The United States and Canada also utilize a \nCustomer Service Branch (CSB)\n, which tend to feature a showroom and a more standardized stocking model of products designed for contractors. CSBs often conduct some business with non-account or retail-like customers. At the end of 2024, 87% of our United States and Canada branches operated as a CFC and 13% operated as a CSB. Outside the United States and Canada we typically deploy an \nInternational Branch\n. These locations lack a showroom and tend to service fewer customers who tend to be large, national account customers disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing and heavily oriented toward planned product spend.\n3\nTable of Contents\nRegardless of what branch type ultimately evolves to service the unique features of a specific geographic location, all our branches share a common purpose and similar operating priorities. We believe our ability to provide a consistent local service model on a global basis is attractive to our customer base, which consists heavily of North American-based multinational companies with significant foreign operations. \nSince Fastenal's founding and through 2013, branch openings were a primary growth driver for us, peaking in 2013 at 2,687 locations. Branches were entirely U.S.-based until 1994, when we opened our first location in Canada followed by opening our first branch location in Mexico in 2001. Since then, we have continued to expand our global footprint, including into Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. In the period from 2013 to 2023, we experienced a net decline of 1,090 in our total branch count, which was primarily due to consolidations in our U.S. market. New growth drivers, business models, and business tools emerged and diminished the direct role of branch openings in our growth, resulting in a strategic rationalization to align our physical footprint with changes in our business strategies. In 2024, we disclosed that this strategic rationalization had concluded and future openings and closings were likely to be more balanced and in accordance with the strategies and specific circumstances of local operations. \nAt the end of 2024, we had 1,499 branches in North America, which includes the United States, Canada, and Mexico, representing 52.2% of net sales and 98 branches outside of North America representing 2.2% of net sales. \nOnsite locations\n are not new, having entered into the first such arrangement in 1992. However, it was largely a local option that grew slowly before we identified it as a growth driver in 2014, at which point we made substantial investments to accelerate its traction in the marketplace. In this model, we provide dedicated sales and service to a single customer from a location that is physically within, or strategically proximate to, the customer's facility, with inventory that is specific to the customer's needs. In many cases, we are shifting sales with the customer from an existing branch location, though we also see new customer opportunities arise as a result of our Onsite capabilities. The model is best suited for larger companies, though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of sales than most of our competitors. It has been our experience that the sales mix at our Onsite locations typically produces a lower gross profit percentage than at our branch locations, but we gain sales with the customer and our cost to serve is lower. We have identified over 11,000 manufacturing and construction customer locations in North America with potential to implement the Onsite service model. These include customers with which we have an existing national account relationship today, and potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence with which we do not have a meaningful relationship today. However, as awareness of our capabilities has grown, we have identified additional Onsite potential with certain agencies of state, provincial, and local government customers, and academia. We also believe as we continue to follow our existing national account customers outside the U.S., our market potential for Onsite solutions will continue to expand. The international opportunity is substantial, but our speed is limited by our relatively underdeveloped infrastructure in comparison to the U.S. We expect sales from Onsite arrangements to continue to increase meaningfully over time. At the end of 2024, we had 1,961 Onsite locations in North America, which included the United States, Canada, and Mexico, representing 41.6% of net sales and 70 Onsite locations outside of North America representing 0.8% of net sales. As of December 31, 2024, we signed 358, 326, and 356 new Onsite locations (referred to herein as signings) in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \n4\nTable of Contents\nAt the end of 2024, we operated branches and Onsites in 25 total countries. The following table provides a summary of the branches and Onsite locations we operated at the end of each year, as well as the openings, closings, and conversions during each year:\nNorth America\nOutside North America\nU.S.\n (1)\nCanada\nMexico\nSubtotal\nCentral & South America \n(2)\nAsia \n(3)\nEurope \n(4)\nSubtotal\nTotal\nIn-Market Locations - 12/31/22\n2,707 \n276 \n177 \n3,160 \n21 \n45 \n80 \n146 \n3,306 \nStarting Branches\n1,369 \n169 \n66 \n1,604 \n5 \n22 \n52 \n79 \n1,683 \nOpened Branches\n— \n— \n3 \n3 \n— \n3 \n4 \n7 \n10 \nClosed/Converted Branches \n(5)\n(92)\n(5)\n— \n(97)\n— \n— \n1 \n1 \n(96)\nEnding Branches \n1,277 \n164 \n69 \n1,510 \n5 \n25 \n57 \n87 \n1,597 \nStarting Onsites\n1,338 \n107 \n111 \n1,556 \n16 \n23 \n28 \n67 \n1,623 \nOpened Onsites\n283 \n18 \n20 \n321 \n— \n1 \n7 \n8 \n329 \nClosed/Converted Onsites \n(5)\n(115)\n(6)\n(3)\n(124)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(6)\n(130)\nEnding Onsites\n1,506 \n119 \n128 \n1,753 \n15 \n22 \n32 \n69 \n1,822 \nIn-Market Locations - 12/31/23\n2,783 \n283 \n197 \n3,263 \n20 \n47 \n89 \n156 \n3,419 \nStarting Branches\n1,277 \n164 \n69 \n1,510 \n5 \n25 \n57 \n87 \n1,597 \nOpened Branches\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n2\n \n—\n \n3\n \n6\n \n9\n \n11\n \nClosed/Converted Branches \n(5)\n(14)\n—\n \n1\n \n(13)\n—\n \n(1)\n3\n \n2\n \n(11)\nEnding Branches \n1,264\n \n164\n \n71\n \n1,499\n \n5\n \n27\n \n66\n \n98\n \n1,597\n \nStarting Onsites\n1,506 \n119 \n128 \n1,753 \n15 \n22 \n32 \n69 \n1,822 \nOpened Onsites\n271\n \n36\n \n27\n \n334\n \n—\n \n4\n \n5\n \n9\n \n343\n \nClosed/Converted Onsites \n(5)\n(117)\n(2)\n(7)\n(126)\n(1)\n—\n \n(7)\n(8)\n(134)\nEnding Onsites \n1,660\n \n153\n \n148\n \n1,961\n \n14\n \n26\n \n30\n \n70\n \n2,031\n \nIn-Market Locations - 12/31/24\n2,924\n \n317\n \n219\n \n3,460\n \n19\n \n53\n \n96\n \n168\n \n3,628\n \n(1)\nIncludes the U.S., the Dominican Republic, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\n(2)\nIncludes Panama, Brazil, and Chile.\n(3)\nIncludes Singapore, China, Malaysia, and Thailand.\n(4)\nIncludes the Netherlands, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Spain, France, and Belgium.\n(5)\nThe net impact of non-in-market locations or Onsite locations converted to branches, branches converted to Onsite locations or non-in-market locations, and closures of branches or Onsite locations.\nWe believe the profitability of our in-market locations is affected by the average sales produced by each site. In any in-market location, certain costs related to growth are at least partly variable, such as employee-related expenses, while others, like rent and utility costs, tend to be fixed. As a result, it has been shown that as an in-market location increases its sales base over time, it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin. This ability to increase our operating profit margin is influenced by: (1) general growth based on end market expansion and/or market share gains that increases the monthly sales of the location and (2) the age of the in-market location (new locations tend to be less profitable due to start-up costs and, in the case of a branch, the time necessary to generate a customer base). The paths to higher operating profit margins are slightly different in a traditional branch versus an Onsite location, as the former will tend to have more fixed costs to leverage, while the latter will tend to have a smaller fixed cost burden but have greater leverage of its employee-related expenses. In the short term, the Onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established sales away from an existing branch even as its fixed expenses are largely unchanged.\nThere are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close an in-market location. Key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market, factories may have closed, our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer branches, and/or our customers may have transitioned to our Onsite model. An Onsite location may also close because local or regional management determines that the business at the location is unlikely to scale sufficiently to justify our being on premise, in which case the relationship often reverts to being managed in a local branch. \n5\nTable of Contents\nWe utilize additional types of selling locations within our network, but these tend to be more specialized in nature and relatively few in number, comprising less than five percent of our total selling locations. We remain committed to a large, robust service network, including traditional branches, international branch\nes, and Onsites; it r\nemains the indispensable foundation of our business. We anticipate that relatively stable branch count in the United States and Canada, combined with growth in branch count outside of the United States and Canada and growth in global Onsite locations, will result in an increase to overall in-market locations over time.\nOur Business Tools\nFastenal Managed Inventory (FMI\n®\n)\nOver time, we have invested in and developed various technologies that allow us to put physical product closer to the point of use in a customer location, increase the visibility of a customer's supply chain (to the customer as well as our personnel), and/or improve the ability to monitor or control usage. While there are isolated exceptions, these technologies are not themselves channels to the market but rather are utilized by our branch and Onsite channels to enhance service to our customers. Collectively, these tools comprise our Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI) Technology suite. We believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers. FMI programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and, coupled with our fully integrated distribution network, foster a strong relationship with customers.\nIndustrial vending (FASTVend\n®\n)\n was introduced in 2008 to provide our customers with improved product monitoring and control. Benefits include reduced consumption, reduced purchase orders, reduced product handling, and 24-hour product availability. We believe that we have a market advantage by virtue of our extensive in-market network of inventory and local personnel. For these reasons, the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011, and we finished 2024 with approximately 119,800 FASTVend devices in the field. We believe industrial vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized. We also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base of devices before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support. We estimate the market could support as many as 1.7 million vending units and, as a result, we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time. \nOur industrial vending portfolio consists of 20 different vending devices, with 16 of these being in either a helix or locker format. Our most utilized models include the helix-based FAST 5000 and our 12- and 18-door lockers; combined, these comprise approximately 64% of our installed base of devices. These are either configurable or are available in multiple configurations to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customers. Target monthly sales per device typically range from under $1,000 to in excess of $3,000, with our flagship FAST 5000 device having a targeted monthly throughput of $2,000. \nBin stock (FASTStock\n℠\n and FASTBin\n®\n)\n programs, where product is held in bins in a customer facility, are similar to our vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities. Such programs have existed in the industrial supply industry for a considerable time, with open bins being clustered in a racking system, each of which holds original equipment manufacturing (OEM) fasteners, maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) fasteners, and/or non-fastener products that are consumed in the customers' operations. Historically, these bins were simply plastic and metal containers that held product and were visually inspected by our customers or Fastenal personnel to determine replenishment need. These bins in some cases are organized and labeled into customized digital plan-o-grams, which we call FASTStock and allow for the scanning of product when it is at a minimum desired level. However, in 2019 we introduced our FASTBin technology. FASTBin is the evolution of FASTStock into a set of electronic inventory management solutions that automate process controls by providing 24/7 continuous inventory monitoring, real-time inventory visibility, and automatic replenishment of bin stock parts.\nThese technologies come in four forms: (1) scales that utilize a high-precision weight sensor system to measure the exact quantity on hand in real time, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum; (2) infrared (IR) that uses IR sensors lining individual bins to provide real-time visibility of approximate quantity and inventory values, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum threshold; (3) RFID, which is a Kanban system that utilizes RFID tags so that when an empty bin is removed from the rack and placed in a replenishment zone (also part of the same racking system), a notification is sent to Fastenal to refill the order; and (4) FASTClick, which is an electronic button utilized on products or in locations that do not lend themselves to a vending- or bin-based solution that allows a customer to signal they would like a replenishment activity without the need of a Fastenal representative. These technologies provide superior monitoring capabilities and immediate visibility to consumption changes, allowing for a lean supply chain, reducing risk of stock-outs, and providing a more efficient labor model for both the customer and the supplier.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur \nweighted FMI measure\n combines signings and installations of FASTBin and FASTVend in a standardized machine equivalent unit (MEU) based on the expected output of each type of device. We do not include FASTStock in this measurement because scanned stocking locations can take many forms, such as bins, shelves, cabinets, pallets, etc., that cannot be converted into a standardized MEU. This conversion takes the targeted monthly throughput of each FMI device signed or installed and compares it to the $2,000 target monthly throughput of our FAST 5000 vending device. For example, an RFID enclosure, with target monthly sales of $2,000 would be counted as '1.00' machine equivalent ($2,000/$2,000 = 1.00). An infrared bin, with target monthly sales of $40, would be counted as '0.02' machine equivalent ($40/$2,000 = 0.02).\nThe table below summarizes the signings and installations of, and sales through, our FMI devices.\nTwelve-month Period\n2024\n2023\nChange\nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend signings (MEUs)\n27,984\n \n24,126 \n16.0 \n%\nSignings per day\n110\n \n95 \nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend installations (MEUs; end of period)\n126,957\n \n113,138 \n12.2 \n%\nFASTStock sales\n$\n956.6\n \n927.6 \n3.1 \n%\n% of sales\n12.5\n \n%\n12.5 \n%\nFASTBin/FASTVend sales\n$\n2,295.5\n \n2,070.2 \n10.9 \n%\n% of sales\n30.0\n \n%\n27.8 \n%\nFMI sales\n$\n3,252.1\n \n2,997.8 \n8.5 \n%\nFMI daily sales\n$\n12.8\n \n11.8 \n7.6 \n%\n% of sales\n42.5\n \n%\n40.3 \n%\nDigital Solutions\nWe also invest in digital solutions that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers, leverage local inventory for same-day solutions, and provide efficient service. While there is a transactional element to our digital services, many of the solutions we invest in are intended to add value to customers by illuminating various elements of their supply chain. In many cases, this provides insights that allow us to migrate transactional, 'non-sticky' (and traditionally high cost) online spend into a 'sticky' managed setting (such as our FMI programs). These solutions take many forms:\n1) \nTransactional\n. Our eBusiness includes eProcurement activities, which are integrated transactions, including electronic data interchange (EDI), and eCommerce (transactional website sales), which provide a means for our customers to effectively and efficiently procure MRO and unplanned spend. While there is a retail component to our transactional digital services, most of the sales attributable to this is with our traditional customer base, nearly all of which purchase digitally as a supplement to other channels and tools it utilizes with Fastenal. We attribute the sales generated from a customer location through our transactional platforms to the in-market location traditionally servicing this customer location.\n2) \nAnalytics\n. Data analytics provide customers with detailed insights into their business operations. FAST360° offers a comprehensive view of inventory and spending, allowing users to visualize product organization and analyze spending trends. FAST360° Analytics uses Microsoft Power BI to offer stakeholders visualization tools for analyzing spend, supply channels, and cost savings. FAST360° acts as the bridge between our fulfillment operations and a customer's view into our managed service model, and provides our customers with one central source of information. These platforms empower users to make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and improve efficiency by providing actionable insights into Fastenal-managed inventory and spending. By incorporating visual representations of complex data into standardized and tailored reporting templates, the team collaborates with Fastenal's customers and business leaders to turn insights into action.  \n3) \nDigital Visibility\n. Certain of our digital capabilities are intended to produce operational efficiencies for our customers and ourselves and/or to deliver strategic value by illuminating customer supply chain operations. For instance, we have developed, and continue to develop, 'Mobility' applications, one example of which is our Vending App, which provides a number of benefits. It provides easy, real-time information pertaining to a customer's local inventory position within their point-of-use devices. It incorporates customer usage data to recommend optimized parts and quantity for specific devices, which improves customer inventories while reducing the risk of stock-outs. Moving our fulfillment process from a vending device-based keypad function to a tablet or scanning interaction improves the restock process (reduced risk of product outages), reducing time consumed (greater efficiency) while improving accuracy (improved quality assurance). We will continue to build out our suite of Mobility applications. EDI is the connectivity between our system and our customers' procurement systems – whether a direct integration into their Enterprise Resource Planning system or through a third-party procurement network or marketplace. These solutions provide a system-to-system exchange of electronic procurement documents (such as purchase orders, advanced shipping notices, and invoices for direct and indirect spend). Our eProcurement Solutions provide a bridge between our \n7\nTable of Contents\nmanaged replenishment activity and our customers' procurement systems – creating an efficient, accurate and streamlined procure-to-pay process. \n4.) \nCrib Management\n. We host FASTCrib, a cloud-based software tool designed to provide customers with visibility and control of their entire supply chain. It is an integrated platform that maintains customer-specific product catalogs, provides control and tracking of inventory levels, streamlines and consolidates procurement processes, and enables rich visualization and reporting in an environment with robust user controls. It also has modules for asset tracking and integrates into our FMI suite. FASTCrib creates a one-stop, just-in-time supply chain management capability for all of the products and services consumed by our customers, whether provided directly by Fastenal or other vendors.  \nDigital Footprint\nOur d\nigita\nl products and services are comprised of sales through FMI (FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend) plus that proportion of our eBusiness sales that do not represent billings of FMI services (collectively,\n our Digital Footprint).\n We believe the data that is created through our digital capabilities enhances product visibility, traceability, and control that reduces risk in operations and creates ordering and fulfillment efficiencies for both us and our customers. As a result, we believe our opportunity to grow our business will be enhanced through the continued development and expansion of our digital capabilities. Our Digital Footprint represented 60.4% of sales in 2024.\nWe believe the combination of our broad product offering, physical presence on a global scale, and toolbox of services, specialists, and digital capabilities, produces a customer engagement model that is difficult for large and small competitors to replicate. This is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and difficult to displace service. We also believe it differentiates us when compared to web purchasing models as an independent sales channel. We expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time. Our greatest opportunity lies with the deployment of efficient and effective supply chain programs. We are focused on addressing the four key components: people, products, processes, and technology, to support this model.\nDistribution Network\nWe operate 15 regional distribution centers in North America: 12 in the U.S., two in Canada, and one in Mexico. We also operate one distribution center in Asia and  two distribution centers in Europe. These distribution centers give us approximately 5.1 million square feet of distribution capacity. Additional details on these locations can be found within the 'Item 2. Properties' section of this Form 10-K. These distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our in-market locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier, with approximately 79% of our North American in-market locations receiving service four to five times per week. The distribution centers in Indiana and Kansas also serve as 'master' hubs, with those in California and North Carolina serving as 'secondary' hubs to support the needs of the in-market locations in their geographic regions, as well as to provide a broader selection of products for the in-market locations serviced by the other distribution centers.\nWe currently operate 11 of our North American distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). These distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency, and currently handle approximately 94% of our picking activity. We expect to invest in additional automation technologies, expand existing distribution facilities, and/or add new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our in-market locations increases.\nWe also utilize a network of Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminals (LIFTs) which reside within our existing distribution centers and are intended to support areas that have a dense population of FMI devices. Traditionally, branch personnel were solely responsible for stocking and packaging FMI-related inventory, delivering to a customer's location, and refilling the customer's devices. As our sales through FMI devices have grown, this approach resulted in redundant inventory in a territory and a greater proportion of our sales personnel's time being spent on non-sales activities, an issue we are mitigating through LIFTs. We primarily utilize a 'drop-and-deliver' model wherein a LIFT is responsible for stocking and packaging FMI supplies, producing inventory and accuracy benefits, and delivering them to the business unit, where delivery and replenishment is then performed by local district or branch personnel. In a minority of cases we deploy a 'drop-and-scatter' model, wherein delivery and replenishment is also performed by LIFT personnel. In 2024, approximately 10% of our FMI sales was supported through a LIFT, but over time we believe this figure can approximate 40% of our FMI sales.\nTransportation\nThe ability to move product, globally and domestically, from our sources of supply to our customers is critical to the competitiveness of our business model. We utilize multiple modes of transportation to support our business model.\nWe transport product from our global manufacturing and supplier partners to our distribution centers. Related costs range from port fees, duties, costs related to container and shipper services, and inland trucking and intermodal charges. We consider these expenses to be a part of our landed product cost, and significant fluctuations are typically addressed through product pricing.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe transport product between our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our in-market locations. We typically transport approximately 90% of our products on our own fleet of Class 6, 7, and 8 trucks, with the remainder being on third party shippers. Costs range from lease charges, driver pay, fuel costs to support our captive fleet, and fees paid to third-party shippers. These expenses are included in cost of goods sold but are not considered a part of our landed product cost, with fluctuations typically addressed by applying freight charges to customer purchases and by securing commercial back-hauls. We primarily lease our trucks, and at December 31, 2024, we operated approximately 490 units.\nWe transport product from our in-market locations to our customers on a fleet of pick-up, box, and other trucks. Expenses to maintain this fleet are considered selling-related transportation costs, which include lease charges, depreciation, and fuel, and are typically reflected in all other SG&A expenses. We have a mix of leased and owned vehicles, and at December 31, 2024, we operated approximately 10,200 units.\nInformation Systems\nOur Information Systems teams develop, implement, secure, and maintain the computer-based technology used to support business functions within Fastenal. Corporate, digital, distribution center, and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations, while each selling location uses a locally installed Point-Of-Sale system. The systems consist of custom in-house developed, purchased, and subscription licensed software. A dedicated Wide Area Network is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users.\nTrademarks and Service Marks\nWe conduct business under various trademarks and service marks, and we utilize a variety of designs and taglines in connection with each of these marks, including \nWhere Industry Meets Innovation\n™\n. \nAlthough we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks, we consider the 'Fastenal' name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, various trademarks and service marks. Our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the U.S. as long as they are in use, their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use.\nProducts\nFastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies. This includes threaded fasteners, bolts, nuts, screws, studs, and related washers, as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware, such as pins, machinery keys, concrete anchors, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, rivets, and related accessories. Our fastener product line, which is primarily sold under the Fastenal product name, represented 30.7% of our consolidated sales in 2024.\nFastener distribution is complex. In most cases, the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight. This presents challenges in moving product from suppliers, most of whom are outside of North America, to our distribution centers, as well as from our distribution centers to our in-market and customer locations. At the same time, fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products, construction projects, and maintenance and repair while also exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application. In many cases, a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime and/or effective use. These features have greatly influenced our logistical development, training and educational programs, support capabilities, and inventory decisions, which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate.\nIn 1993, we began to aggressively add additional product lines, and these represented 69.3% of our consolidated sales in 2024. These products, which we refer to as non-fastener product lines, tend to move through the same distribution channel, get used by the same customers, and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line. This logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering. However, over time, the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line. For instance, non-fastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending.\nThe largest category of non-fastener products is our safety supplies product line, which accounted for 22.2% of our consolidated sales in 2024. This product line has seen significant sales growth in the last 10 years, which we believe is directly attributable to our success cross-selling safety supplies to customers that utilize us for non-safety products, as well as our ability to market, deploy, and service industrial vending over that period. We expect these variables to remain the primary drivers of performance for our safety supplies product line.\nWe plan to continue to add other product lines in the future.\nIn the last several decades, we have added 'private label' brands (often referred to as 'Exclusive Brands', or brands sold exclusively through Fastenal) to our non-fastener offering. Prior to 2023, each of our product categories tended to have its own private label. In 2023, we consolidated these into two labels: Body Guard\n®\n, which is our long-standing brand for North American safety supplies, and ORMADUS\n®\n, which is our global brand encompassing the remainder of our product offerings. These private label brands represented approximately 12% of our consolidated sales in 2024.\n \nWe believe it is also appropriate \n9\nTable of Contents\nto think about our private label sales as a percentage of our non-fastener sales for two reasons: (1) there is not a well-defined branded versus private label dynamic in fasteners as there is in non-fasteners; and (2) non-fastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers, who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business. Private label brand sales represented approximately 17% of our total non-fastener sales in 2024. Over time we expect our private label sales as a percentage of our total non-fastener sales to increase, although oftentimes, these increases through specific channels are masked by the relative sales growth we experience with Onsite locations, which typically have a lower percentage of total sales of private label than in branches or sales through vending devices.\nDetailed information about our sales by product line is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included later in this Form 10-K. Each product line may contain multiple product categories.\nInventory Control\nOur inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, by our sales personnel at in-market locations, and by our district and regional leadership. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations, from individual selling locations, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information. Our computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum stocking level. In the past we have utilized a base inventory model for all of our branches, and such a model still exists in a smaller subset of our locations. Increasingly, however, branches primarily stock inventory that is deemed to be appropriate by the district and branch personnel to service the customers within their selling territory. Similarly, non-branch selling locations (primarily Onsites) stock inventory exclusively based on customer-specific arrangements. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call 'inventory re-distribution'.\nInventory held at our selling locations, close to customers and available on a same-day basis, accounted for approximately 59% of our total inventory at the end of 2024. Inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 41% of our total inventory at the end of 2024. The distribution center and manufacturing location inventory, when combined with our trucking network, allows for fast, next-day service at a very competitive cost.\nManufacturing and Support Services Operations\nIn 2024, \napproximately 96% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements. The remaining 4% related to products manufactured, modified, or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our industrial services. These manufactured products c\nonsist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers' specifications \nat one of our nine manufacturing locations, or standard sizes manufactured under our Holo-Krome\n®\n, \nCardinal Fasteners\n®\n, and \nSpensall\n®\n product lines. These manufacturing products represent approximately 7% of our fastener sales. The services provided by the industrial services group include, but are not limited to, tool and hoist repair, chain sling and hose fabrication, band saw blade welding, packaging, and other light manufacturing and fabrication. We may add additional services in the future. We engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect the services to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 6% of our consolidated net sales in the future.\nSources of Supply\nWe use a diverse group of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute. Most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control, strong relationships, reliable lead times, and effective costing. During 2024, we had a single supplier that accounted for more than 5% of our inventory purchases, whereas all remaining suppliers fell below that threshold.\nIn the case of fasteners and our private label non-fastener products, we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area, Asia. Within Asia, suppliers in China and Taiwan represent a significant source of product. Further, in many cases where we source directly from a North American supplier, the original country of origin of the acquired parts is the supplier's Asian facilities. As a result, the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions.\nBeyond inventory, we have some concentration of purchasing activity. For example, we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet, and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment. However, we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these, if necessary.\nCustomers and Marketing\nOur model is built around a broad product offering, timely fulfillment processes, convenient physical locations, extensive digital and services capabilities, and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees. We believe we are successful because of our ability to integrate these features into supply chain solutions that are tailored to the specific challenges \n10\nTable of Contents\nof our customer's operations. When deployed effectively, we have demonstrated the ability to assume responsibility for portions of our customer's sourcing operations while reducing the cost, lowering the risk, and increasing the scalability of our customer's supply chains. Our value proposition is focused on improving the operating effectiveness and reducing the total cost of ownership of our customer's supply chains.\nApproximately 70% to 75% of our customers are in manufacturing end markets, which encompasses heavy machinery, fabricated products, process industries (oil & gas, petrochemical, mining, pulp and paper, etc.), and transportation components (automotive, aerospace, etc.). We provide both the OEM and MRO needs of these customers. The remaining 25% to 30% of our customers fall primarily into non-residential construction (general and commercial contractors), reseller (retail and wholesale trades, dealers, and rental businesses), transportation services (air, train, maritime or truck transport, as well as warehousing and fulfillment centers), and state and local government entities, including schools, school districts, and universities.\nBased on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing, our business has historically been cyclical. However, we believe our model has certain features that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes. First, we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing market. While slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries, locally or globally, we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions. Second, while a meaningful part of our sales is derived from products that are incorporated into final products, the greater proportion of our sales is derived from products used to maintain facilities. This latter source of sales tends to be impacted by cyclical forces, but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic.\nApproximately 72% of our consolidated sales in 2024 were with customers whose spend was subject to a contractual agreement between ourselves and the customer. The terms and conditions of these contracts will vary from customer to customer, with the most common features being the scope of products and services rendered, product and service pricing, payment terms, delivery expectations, quality obligations, warranty and liability exposure, and contract duration. Many contracts will also incorporate expectations for direct (e.g., cost) or indirect (e.g., process productivity and efficiency) savings that are expected to be achieved over the course of the contract and the interval at which progress toward these expectations will be reviewed.  \nOur contractual programs fall into three broad categories:\n•\nNational accounts represent the largest proportion of our contract business, accounting for 63% of our consolidated sales in 2024. This program is aimed at multi-location customers where the scale and scope of the OEM and MRO products that need to be managed are very complex and costly. We believe our broad product offering coupled with our local presence as part of a national and increasingly international footprint, our ability to provide a consistent level of high-touch service, and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing, quality control, and product knowledge, are attractive to these multi-site customers. Further, we believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other capabilities, such as Onsite, FMI, digital solutions, and resources to serve these customers' unique demands.\n•\nLocal and regional contracts tend to establish terms and conditions for a customer's locations that have a more limited geographic scope, typically falling within an individual district or region. The scale and scope of the products and services that are addressed tend to be narrower and less complex than is the case for national account agreements. Some agreements cover the entirety of a customer's operations where the locations are focused in a specific geographic territory. Other agreements may represent a subset of a customer's North American or global operations, with additional locations either covered by separate local and regional contracts, being serviced on a transactional basis, or not being serviced at all. In the former case, we often try to migrate the customer to a national agreement.\n•\nGovernment contracts establish Fastenal as an approved supplier of MRO products to facilities managed by local, state, or municipal authorities. We do not generate meaningful direct sales from federal government agencies. These agreements are not different in function from local and regional non-government contracts. However, they generally involve different priorities, are heavily influenced by stricter regulatory obligations, and require specialized knowledge and processes to negotiate and maintain compliance.  \nWe anticipate sales to contract customers will increase as a percentage of our total sales over time.\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\nActive Accounts\n100,052\n105,448\n119,583\n130,020\n137,380\n152,491\n156,069\nKey Accounts\n39,467\n39,266\n39,151\n36,190\n33,794\n34,621\n32,895\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur basic unit of measurement of customer b\nusiness activity in an in-market location is an active account, which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $100 per month. Customers often have more than one active account at a single in-market location, reflecting their utilization of different Fastenal services, and frequently have active accounts at many in-market locations across our global network. In 2024, approximately 99.5% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our active accounts, with the remainder being from walk-in or infrequent, non-account, and small account customers. We have reported on the quantity of our active accounts annually, as set forth in the table above. The table also includes a subset of our active accounts, called 'key accounts'. This is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $2,000 per month. Key accounts have been a greater focus of our selling activities since 2020 because they typically utilize a wider range of our products and services, and in 2024, approximately 93.2% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our key accounts.\nDuring 2024, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated net sales.\nDirect marketing continues to be the backbone o\nf our business through our local in-market selling personnel, as well as our non-branch selling personnel. We support our sales team with multi-channel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing, print and rad\nio advertising, targeted campaigns, promotional flyers, and events. Our national advertising has been focused on a NASCAR\n®\n sponsorship serving as a primary partner of Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing\n®\n,\n \nwhich stands as one of the longest tenured-brands in NASCAR. In 2020, our sports marketing efforts were extended when the National Hockey League (NHL\n®\n) awarded us as the preferred MRO supplier of the sport.\nSeasonality\nSeasonality has some impact on our sales. The first and fourth quarters of each year are typically our lower volume periods, given their overlap with winter months in North America during which our direct and indirect sales to customers in the non-residential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather. The fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the Thanksgiving (October in Canada and November in the U.S.), Christmas, and New Year holiday periods, due to plant shut downs. In contrast, the second and third quarters of each year typically have higher sales due to stronger non-residential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays (although Good Friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of July will always fall in the third quarter).\nCompetition\nOur business is highly competitive and includes large national distributors whose strongest presence tends to be in more densely populated areas, and smaller regional or local distributors, which compete in many of the smaller markets in which we have branches. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products, in no particular order, are customer service, price, convenience, product availability, and cost saving solutions.\nMarket strategies in industrial distribution are varied. With respect to products, many of the larger distributors have trended toward a broad-line offering over time; however, they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share. This association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors, though many smaller competitors do deploy a broad-line model. Means of serving the customer are even more diverse. For instance, many competitors maintain a local, branch-based presence in their markets, while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses, while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales. Recent years have seen the emergence of eBusiness solutions, such as websites, and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors, it also has introduced non-traditional web-based competitors into the marketplace. The diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base. The large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels, from a single distributor or a range of distributors, to procure the products they need in their operations.\nWe believe that better service, and a competitive selling advantage, can be provided by maintaining a physical selling and stocking presence closer to the customers' location(s). As a result, we maintain in-market locations in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products. The convenience of a large number of in-market locations in a given area, combined with our ability to provide them with frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers, facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products. We also believe our FMI solutions, supported by an in-market location, provide a unique way to serve our customers with convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors. Having trained personnel at each in-market location also enhances our ability to compete (see 'Employees' below).\nOur Onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers. Building on our core business strategy of the local branch, the Onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers, all with a relatively low incremental investment given the existing branch and distribution structure.\n12\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital Resources\nEmployees\nAt the end of 2024, we employed 23,702 full- and part-time employees. Of these, approximately 71% held a selling role. We characterize these personnel as follows:\n2024\n% of Total\n2023\n% of Total\nSelling personnel \n(1)\n16,712\n \n70.5\n \n%\n16,512 \n71.2 \n%\nDistribution/Transportation personnel\n4,211\n \n17.8\n \n%\n4,042 \n17.4 \n%\nManufacturing personnel\n752\n \n3.2\n \n%\n733 \n3.2 \n%\nOrganizational support personnel\n (2) \n2,027\n \n8.5\n \n%\n1,914 \n8.2 \n%\n     Total personnel\n23,702\n \n100.0\n \n%\n23,201 \n100.0 \n%\n(1)\nOf our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location.\n(2)\nOrganizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (35%-40% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (22% to 27% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business (FSB), accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nEmployee Profile\nOf the employees noted above, 18,701 are located in the U.S., 3,304 are located in Canada and Mexico, and 1,697 are located overseas in 23 other countries throughout the world.\nBased on our EEO-1 data for 2024, in the U.S., females and minorities constitute 24.1% and 24.3% of our workforce, respectively. We believe these absolute figures gain further context when viewed against two additional data sets. First, over the past ten years there is a clear trend toward greater diversity in our business. Since 2014, our female and minority workforces have grown 2.3x and 4.4x faster, respectively, than our overall U.S. workforce. This trend reflects multiple dynamics in our business evolution, including the natural progression of our geographic expansion, the cycle of our promote-from-within philosophy, and efforts to improve hiring processes over time. Second, based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we believe Fastenal's mix of female and minority employees is generally consistent with the proportion of females and minorities working in manufacturing and construction, which is representative of the pool of employees from which we might draw candidates. For instance, relative to the 24.1% of our U.S. workforce that is female, the proportion of females in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 29.3% and 11.2%, respectively. Similarly, relative to the 24.3% of our U.S. workforce that are minorities, the proportion of non-white (a definition utilized by the U.S. Census Bureau) individuals in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 22.2% and 12.7%, respectively.\nHealth and Safety\nEmployee health and safety continues to be a priority in every aspect of our business. We have taken a multi-faceted approach to safety that helps us understand and reduce hazards in our business. Today, our health and safety programs span all operations including manufacturing, distribution centers, fleet and auto, and our branch and Onsite network. These key business units play a dynamic role in defining how we engage with our employees on health and safety. Trainings, audits, inspections, risk assessments, safety coaching, and employee engagement are all programs that help us consistently manage our facility safety and employee safety. In 2024, there were over 247,000 completed health and safety engagements, which is an increase of 16% compared to 2023. Our internal scorecard system and safety management system ensures we maintain focus on a variety of risks while we sustain an inclusive safety environment that contributes to innovation and improved performance. We continue to expand and evolve our safety programs to better meet our employee needs and workplace conditions as our business grows.\nThis commitment to, and continuous improvement toward, a safer work environment for our employees has generated excellent results. A widely accepted measure of organizational health and safety is the Experience Modification Rate (EMR). An organization's EMR is established through the comparison of a company's past and expected losses incurred through workplace injury against industry averages, which are compiled by the National Council on Compensation Insurance and consider unique variables such as the size and characteristics of an organization. Industry averages are benchmarked at a 1.00 EMR, with a reduction in the rate being reflective of an organization's ability to implement superior safety procedures and protocols, resulting in a safer environment and reducing both personnel and financial risk. In 2024, Fastenal had an EMR of 0.46, which is 54% better than the average performance rate for our industry.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, we achieved third-party re-certification for the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System. This certification illustrates the strength of our health and safety programs, as well as our commitment to continual improvement to better support our growing workforce. As our business model continues to grow through our branch and Onsite network, our customer critical programs have evolved to mitigate risk and incidents, while meeting customer specific needs. This partnership with our customers allows us to collaborate and expand our health and safety programs to enhance our customers' workplace safety performance.\nEmployment and Compensation Philosophy\nFastenal's success is defined by our people. Our cultural values – \nAmbition\n, \nIntegrity\n, \nInnovation,\n and\n Teamwork\n – are woven into the fabric of our human resources processes and protocols, and inform our employment and compensation philosophies.\nSeveral principles underpin our employment philosophy. One principle is decentralization: placing employees close to our customers' operations and trusting these employees to independently make local decisions to provide differentiated local service. A second principle is that we are a passionately promote-from-within company, guided by a belief that if you work hard, make great decisions, learn from mistakes, and exemplify our cultural values, you should receive greater opportunity and responsibility. We believe these principles cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset and foster an environment of trust and empowerment.\nAs it relates to our compensation philosophy, we believe our combination and mix of base and bonus pay motivates our people to high levels of individual and company success, as the goals and objectives have been repeatedly demonstrated to be achievable with superior effort. We are guided by simple principles. First, compensation programs should be easy to understand, with goals and objectives that are clearly communicated and resources for success that are provided. They should be calculable by the employee and numbers-driven (e.g., not subjective). Second, total compensation should have a significant component that is based on how well the employee has grown their piece of the business and served our customers. Third, employees should receive incentives as soon as practical upon attainment of the goal.\nApproximately 71% of our employees interface directly with customers on a daily or frequent basis, with the remainder supporting the selling efforts of our customer-facing employees. Typical pay arrangements provide a base amount paid periodically during the month, along with a major opportunity to earn bonus amounts, paid monthly, based on growth in sales, gross or pre-tax profit achieved, and prudent management of working capital. In certain roles, there may also be a portion of compensation based on contribution to attaining predetermined departmental or project and cost containment goals, most of which are focused on either customer service or better execution of company-wide activities.\nBecause we believe the growth in our stock value should be the reward for achieving long-term success consistent with being an owner, we have a stock option plan. In the case of certain foreign employees, we have a stock appreciation rights plan. All of our employees are eligible to receive stock option grants or stock appreciation rights.\nWe believe our combination of short- and long-term rewards and incentives has proven successful as reflected in our historic performance and levels of employee retention and turnover.\nOur employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe our employee relations are good.\nTalent Acquisition and Development\nFastenal's values are integral to our employment process and serve as guideposts for leadership. The ultimate goal is straightforward: find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. Reasons to stay include training, opportunity, and a welcoming environment. From a practical standpoint, this means that we attract a broad group of candidates and then hire the candidate who is the best match for the position based on their skills and abilities. In accordance with our decentralized leadership structure, we believe the person best suited to make this decision is the local leader trying to fill the opening. In light of our promote-from-within philosophy, we know we are hiring a potential future leader with every new hire.\nOur Human Resources department develops efficient processes to expand our reach and pool of diverse talent while balancing the needs and requirements of data collection and storage. We have created a standardized framework for posting jobs and interviewing for positions, supplemented with training through the FSB. We have a Diversity and Compliance team that is heavily involved in developing this standardized framework, which ensures its integrity. Not only is this process followed for all new hires, we replicate the same procedures for any internal transfers and promotions.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe FSB (our internal corporate university program) develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company-specific training and development programs that are offered to our employees. The programs are offered through a combination of classroom instructor-led training, virtual instructor-led training, and online learning. FSB provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees' performance. In addition, we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning, as well as training plans based on roles within Fastenal. These institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business, such as leadership, effective best practices, sales and marketing, products, supply chain, and distribution.\nProduct Sourcing Endeavors\nSourcing from suppliers with good standing is the foundation of an ethical supply chain. We expect our suppliers to comply with all relevant regulations and applicable standards. Our teams conduct risk analysis for suppliers who want to do business with us and require them to provide additional supporting documentation affirming their ethics, quality, and reliability. This ensures they meet our standards in these areas and are complying with Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. Utilizing third-party tools and global databases, Fastenal actively monitors government sanctions, denied party listings, withhold release orders, export restriction updates, financial status, adverse media, and multiple other official exclusion lists that provide information on any known risk of any entities and locations with which Fastenal engages, and screens all business partners against those lists. Additionally, we monitor key areas of trade-related risk, including dual-use goods, trade cases, anti-dumping and counter-vailing cases, and other protectionist trade measures for all countries that products are traded in. As part of our comprehensive Supply Chain Security program, we also evaluate our suppliers' approach to labor to ensure that they are using appropriate, and appropriately compensated, employees and ensure upstream supply chain visibility on globally sourced products.\nWith a local and global supplier base, continuous evaluation and local representation is a necessity to ensure protocols are flagged when risk may be evident, ensuring a safeguard against poor and/or impaired quality and regulatory violations that may otherwise impact our reputation or ability to effectively operate in the marketplace. This is performed not only at the time of supplier vetting and onboarding, but for the life of the relationship with the supplier. This process promotes a supply chain that is supportive of Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. In the event of non-compliance or potential risk, we work with the supplier to correct the situation. If remediation efforts are not undertaken to ensure the supplier remains in compliance with Fastenal's standards and code of conduct, alternative sources of supply may be considered to ensure the integrity of our supply chain. Supply chain compliance representatives are placed in international corporate offices to ensure global coverage and governance, ensuring that no matter where a customers' operations may take them, Fastenal has the infrastructure, resources, and internal processes established to perform its supply chain governance obligations.\nIn 2024, approximately 26% of our total company-wide inventory spend was with small and/or diverse businesses. This flows from our Supplier Diversity program, as part of which we are committed to building supply chain relationships with small businesses and businesses with diverse ownership.\nAvailable Information\nOur Internet address for corporate and investor information is www.fastenal.com.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons for the current year and the prior year. Discussions of 2022 items can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nBusiness and Operational Overview\nFastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of more than 3,600 in-market locations. Our largest end market is manufacturing. Sales to these customers include products for both OEM, where our products are consumed in the final products of our customers, and MRO, where our products are consumed to support the facilities and ongoing operations of our customers. We also service general and commercial contractors in non-residential end markets as well as farmers, truckers, railroads, oil exploration companies, oil production and refinement companies, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our branches, Onsite locations, and customers are primarily located in North America, though we continue to grow our non-North American presence as well.\nIt is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace: First, it is big and fragmented. We estimate the North American marketplace for industrial supplies is in excess of $140 billion per year (and we have expanded beyond North America) and no company has a significant portion of this market. Second, many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive, but the cost and time to manage, procure, and transport these products can be quite meaningful. Third, many customers prefer to reduce their number of MRO and OEM suppliers to simplify their business, while also utilizing various technologies and models (including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly) to improve availability and reduce waste. Lastly, we believe the markets are efficient. In our view, this means that companies who grow market share are those that develop differentiated capabilities that provide the greatest value to the customer.\nOur approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto \nGrowth Through Customer Service\n®\n \nand our tagline \nWhere Industry Meets Innovation\n™\n. The concept of growth is simple: find more customers every day that value the services we provide and increase our activity with them. However, execution is hard work. First, we recruit service-minded individuals to support customers and empower them to operate in a decentralized fashion to maximize their flexibility to solve customer problems. We support these customer-facing resources with a supply chain capability that is speedy, efficient, and cost-effective. This has formed the foundation of our high-touch model since inception. Second, we invest in, develop, and deploy capabilities that allow us to illuminate and provide greater control over a customer's supply chain. These capabilities range from service models that take advantage of our local presence and/or our ability to more efficiently manage complex procurement needs, to hardware and software technologies that promote actionable data capture, improve operating efficiencies, and reduce supply chain risk. Third, we strive to generate strong profits, which produce the cash flow necessary to support our growth, our product and technology development, and the needs of our customers.\nThe ultimate aim of this 'high-touch, high-tech' approach to gaining market share is to allow us to get closer to our customers, going so far as to be right to the point of consumption within customers' facilities. Marrying our presence, capabilities and technologies deepens our relationships and our understanding of our customers' day-to-day opportunities and obstacles. This, in turn, enhances our ability to provide innovative and comprehensive solutions to our customers' challenges. By doing these things every day, Fastenal remains a growth-centric organization.\n32\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Overview\nThe following table presents a performance summary of our results of operations for the periods ended December 31.\n2024\n2023\nYOY\nChange\n2022\nYOY\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n7,546.0\n \n7,346.7 \n2.7 \n%\n$\n6,980.6 \n5.2 \n%\nBusiness days\n255\n \n253 \n254 \nDaily sales\n$\n29.6\n \n29.0 \n1.9 \n%\n$\n27.5 \n5.7 \n%\nGross profit\n$\n3,401.9\n \n3,354.5 \n1.4 \n%\n$\n3,215.8 \n4.3 \n%\n% of net sales\n45.1\n \n%\n45.7 \n%\n46.1 \n%\nSG&A expenses\n$\n1,891.9\n \n1,825.8 \n3.6 \n%\n$\n1,762.2 \n3.6 \n%\n% of net sales\n25.1\n \n%\n24.9 \n%\n25.2 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n1,510.0\n \n1,528.7 \n-1.2 \n%\n$\n1,453.6 \n5.2 \n%\n% of net sales\n20.0\n \n%\n20.8 \n%\n20.8 \n%\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n1,508.1\n \n1,522.0 \n-0.9 \n%\n$\n1,440.0 \n5.7 \n%\n% of net sales\n20.0\n \n%\n20.7 \n%\n20.6 \n%\nNet income\n$\n1,150.6\n \n1,155.0 \n-0.4 \n%\n$\n1,086.9 \n6.3 \n%\nDiluted net income per share\n$\n2.00\n \n2.02 \n-0.6 \n%\n$\n1.89 \n6.7 \n%\nNote – Daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days (in the U.S.) in the period.\nWe saw modest economic contraction in our key markets in 2024. The Institute for Supply Management's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) for the U.S. averaged 48.3 for the full year and remained below 50, the threshold demarcating manufacturing growth or contraction, in 11 out of 12 months. Business activity as measured by U.S. Industrial Production declined 0.4% in the first 11 months of 2024 over 2023 with markets that are most relevant to us, such as Primary Metal (-1.5%), Fabricated Metals (-0.8%), and Machinery (-2.2%) declining more rapidly than the broad index. This was the primary factor contributing to daily sales growth of 1.9%, slowing from the preceding year. The overall profile of our growth was consistent with 2023: growth was driven by larger, key accounts and Onsite customers and by non-fastener products, particularly safety. We continued to expand our installed base of Onsites and FMI technology and lift the proportion of sales that run through our Digital Footprint. However, the effect of our continued investment in key areas we view as critical to accelerate future growth and the slow growth in sales volume combined to pressure our profitability, reducing operating margin. On the other hand, asset efficiency remained stable from the preceding year and we generated good cash flow.\nThe table below summarizes our absolute and full-time equivalent (FTE; based on 40 hours per week) employee headcount, our investments related to in-market locations (defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of active Onsite locations), and weighted FMI devices at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the end of the prior period.\nQ4\n2024\nQ4\n2023\nTwelve-month\n% Change\nSelling personnel\n \n- absolute employee headcount\n16,712\n \n16,512\n1.2 \n%\nSelling personnel - FTE employee headcount\n15,055\n \n15,070\n-0.1 \n%\nTotal personnel - absolute employee headcount\n23,702\n \n23,201\n2.2 \n%\nTotal personnel - FTE employee headcount\n20,958\n \n20,721\n1.1 \n%\nNumber of branch locations\n1,597\n \n1,597\n— \n%\nNumber of active Onsite locations\n2,031\n \n1,822\n11.5 \n%\nNumber of in-market locations\n3,628\n \n3,419\n6.1 \n%\nWeighted FMI devices (MEU installed count)\n126,957\n \n113,138\n12.2 \n%\n33\nTable of Contents\nDuring the last twelve months, we increased our total FTE employee headcount by 237. Our total FTE selling and sales support personnel decreased by 15. While we added FTE to support growth in our Onsite locations, we reduced personnel at our branch locations, reflecting both shifts to Onsite locations and tight management of headcount given challenging business conditions. We had an increase in our distribution and transportation FTE personnel of 115 to support increased product throughput at our distribution facilities. We had an increase in our remaining FTE personnel of 137, which related primarily to personnel investments in manufacturing, quality control, IT, and business analytics.\nThe table below summarizes the number of branches opened and closed, net of conversions, as well as the number of Onsites activated and closed, net of conversions during the periods presented.\nTwelve-month Period\n2024\n2023\nBranch openings\n11\n \n10 \nBranch closures, net of conversions\n(11)\n(96)\n% of net closures vs. prior year-end number of branch locations\n-0.7\n \n%\n-5.7 \n%\nOnsite activations\n343\n \n329 \nOnsite closures, net of conversions\n(134)\n(130)\n% of net closures vs. prior year-end number of Onsite locations\n-7.4\n \n%\n-8.0 \n%\nOur in-market network forms the foundation of our business strategy. In recent years, we have seen a gradual increase in our in-market locations. This has reflected significant growth in Onsites and, to a lesser degree, international branches, which has more than overcome a meaningful decline in our traditional branch network from a strategic rationalization that aligned our physical footprint with changes in our business strategies. Branch closures may occur in the future to reflect normal churn in our business, but the strategic rationalization has concluded. As a result, we expect to see an increase in the rate of in-market location growth as we continue to open Onsites while our traditional branch network remains stable or grows moderately to sustain and improve our North American network, to continue our global expansion beyond North America, and to support our growth drivers. This dynamic played out in 2024.\nCURRENT YEAR RESULTS ENDED 2024\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth consolidated statements of income information (as a percentage of net sales) for the periods ended December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n100.0\n \n%\n100.0 \n%\nGross profit\n45.1\n \n%\n45.7 \n%\nSG&A expenses\n25.1\n \n%\n24.9 \n%\nOperating income\n20.0\n \n%\n20.8 \n%\nNet interest expense\n0.0\n \n%\n-0.1 \n%\nIncome before income taxes\n20.0\n \n%\n20.7 \n%\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales\nThe table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended December 31, and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period:\n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n$\n7,546.0\n \n7,346.7 \nPercentage change\n2.7\n \n%\n5.2 \n%\nBusiness days\n255\n \n253 \nDaily sales\n$\n29.6\n \n29.0 \nPercentage change\n1.9\n \n%\n5.7 \n%\nDaily sales impact of currency fluctuations\n-0.1\n \n%\n-0.3 \n%\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in net sales noted above for 2024 was primarily due to higher unit sales of MRO, OEM, and construction supplies. We believe higher unit sales in 2024 were primarily a result of our ability to gain market share, as most measures of industrial activity were flat to down throughout the period. Despite this challenging environment, in 2024 we produced net sales growth of 2.7% and, owing to two more selling days in the period, daily sales growth of 1.9%.\nWe estimate the disruption to operations and logistics from severe winter weather in January 2024 and hurricanes in September 2024, while meaningful in the months in which they occurred, were not material to net sales for the full year of 2024.\nChanges in product pricing did not have a material impact on net sales in 2024.\nWe effectively increased the penetration of key growth initiatives in 2024, as judged by installations and adoption, which enhanced the value we provide to our customers and supported our growth and efficiency. This was achieved through three areas. First, we signed 358 Onsites in 2024, below our goal of 375 to 400 units but constituting expansion from 2023 (326 signings) and consistent with previous peak signing years in 2019 (362 signings) and 2022 (356 signings). Our installed base of Onsites was 2,031 at the end of December 2024, +11.5% over the preceding year. Second, we signed 27,984 FMI MEUs, meeting our goal at the start of 2024 of 26,000 to 28,000 MEUs and meaningfully above prior year signings of 24,126 MEUs. Our installed base of FMI MEUs was 126,957 at the end of December, +12.2% over the end of December 2023. Third, we expanded the proportion of our sales running through our Digital Footprint. This measure reached 62.5% in November 2024 before easing modestly to 62.1% in December 2024. This was below our goal at the start of 2024 of 66.0%, attributable to lower volume through our FMI devices due to weaker business activity. Even so, it was meaningfully above the prior year level of 56.1% reflecting increasing internal and external adoption of our digital resources. \nWe expect that at some point during 2025 we will achieve having 66% to 68% of our sales volume running through Digital Footprint.\nSales by Product Line\nFrom a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners (including fasteners used in OEM and MRO), safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. The percent of sales in the periods below were as follows:\n2024\n2023\nOEM fasteners\n19.3\n \n%\n20.1 \n%\nMRO fasteners\n11.4\n \n%\n12.3 \n%\nTotal fasteners\n30.7\n \n%\n32.4 \n%\nSafety supplies\n22.2\n \n%\n21.2 \n%\nOther product lines\n47.1\n \n%\n46.4 \n%\nTotal non-fasteners\n69.3\n \n%\n67.6 \n%\nWe experienced a shift in mix away from fasteners and toward safety supplies and other product lines. We experienced a slight decline in sales for fasteners in 2024 due primarily to weak business activity during the year. Fasteners are more heavily oriented toward production of final goods than maintenance, which results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker industrial production. In contrast, safety supplies experienced relatively faster growth. This is a result of lower cyclicality due to the products being used in MRO applications, growth in our installed base of vending devices which disproportionately dispense personal protective equipment (PPE), and strong growth with warehousing customers who are strong consumers of PPE. Other product lines is a mix of OEM- and MRO-oriented products, and relatively strong growth within the latter (e.g., janitorial) was partially offset by relatively slow growth in the former (e.g., tools, cutting tools, material handling). These dynamics produced a meaningful divergence in the daily sales growth rates of our fastener versus our non-fastener product lines in 2024.\nAnnual Sales Changes, Sequential Trends, and End Market Performance\nThis section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a month to the immediately preceding month, and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.\n35\nTable of Contents\nAnnual Sales Changes, by Month\nDuring the months noted below, all of our selling locations, when combined, had a DSR change of (compared to the same month in the preceding year):\n \nJan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\n2024\n1.6\n \n%\n2.6\n \n%\n1.8\n \n%\n0.7\n \n%\n1.5\n \n%\n3.3\n \n%\n0.5\n \n%\n2.1\n \n%\n3.2\n \n%\n2.8\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\n0.0\n \n%\n2023\n11.2 \n%\n9.6 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n7.8 \n%\n5.2 \n%\n4.7 \n%\n3.7 \n%\n3.6 \n%\n5.0 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n3.8 \n%\n5.3 \n%\nSequential Trends\nWe find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –\n This stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain (i.e., April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October. The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.\nHistory has identified these landings in our business cycle. They generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days and/or seasons impact certain end markets, particularly non-residential construction. The first landing centers on Easter and the Good Friday holiday that precedes it, which in any given year can fall in March or April, the second landing centers on July 4th, and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our non-residential construction business and with the Christmas/New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the week.\nThe table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled 'Benchmark' is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average that excludes 2020. We have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends. We believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark. The '2024' and '2023' lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The '24Delta' and '23Delta' lines indicate the difference between the 'Benchmark' and the actual results in the respective year. Under normal circumstances, the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. Further, in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark.\nIt is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages. In a year where demand is strong, our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it. In a year where demand is weak, we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it. In both cases, there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform and puts greater relevance on performance trends over multiple periods.\n \nJan.\n(1)\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAug.\nSept.\nOct.\nCumulative \nChange from \nJan. to Oct.\nBenchmark \n(2)\n0.1 \n%\n1.6 \n%\n3.3 \n%\n-0.7 \n%\n2.5 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n-3.2 \n%\n2.7 \n%\n3.6 \n%\n-2.1 \n%\n9.2 \n%\n2024\n-0.7\n \n%\n2.7\n \n%\n0.2\n \n%\n-1.3\n \n%\n1.5\n \n%\n1.6\n \n%\n-5.3\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\n5.1\n \n%\n-3.4\n \n%\n3.6\n \n%\n24Delta\n-0.8\n \n%\n1.1\n \n%\n-3.1\n \n%\n-0.6\n \n%\n-1.1\n \n%\n0.2\n \n%\n-2.1\n \n%\n0.3\n \n%\n1.5\n \n%\n-1.3\n \n%\n-5.6\n \n%\n2023\n-0.4 \n%\n1.7 \n%\n1.0 \n%\n-0.2 \n%\n0.7 \n%\n-0.2 \n%\n-2.6 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n-3.0 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n23Delta\n-0.5 \n%\n0.1 \n%\n-2.3 \n%\n0.5 \n%\n-1.9 \n%\n-1.5 \n%\n0.5 \n%\n-1.4 \n%\n0.4 \n%\n-0.9 \n%\n-6.8 \n%\n(1)\nThe January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.\n(2)\nThe benchmark for each month is the average of the previous five years for that month.

As previously addressed, we believe these markets contracted slightly in 2024. Our manufacturing end markets outperformed primarily due to the relative strength we are experiencing with key account customers with significant managed spend where our service model and technology is particularly impactful. This disproportionately benefits manufacturing customers. The DSR changes to our manufacturing customers, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, were as follows:\nDSR change - manufacturing customers\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2024\n2.6\n \n%\n2.7\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\n3.3\n \n%\n2.9\n \n%\n2023\n14.4 \n%\n10.4 \n%\n6.2 \n%\n4.7 \n%\n8.9 \n%\nWe estimate approximately 25% to 30% of our business is with customers engaged in a wide range of activities, none of which individually constitute 10% of sales. This includes non-residential construction, reseller, transportation, and government customers. Weakness within our construction end market reflected the ongoing effect of our reduced physical footprint and reduced local inventory tailored to smaller, local contractors. Weakness within our reseller end market reflected efforts in many industries to reduce channel inventories. Strength in our transportation end market reflected strong growth with customers who manage large networks or warehouses, who have increased spend with us due to our ability to meet their needs for rapid fulfillment on a large scale. The DSR changes to our non-manufacturing customers, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, was as follows:\nDSR change - non-manufacturing customers\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2024\n0.0\n \n%\n-1.0\n \n%\n-1.5\n \n%\n-0.3\n \n%\n-0.7\n \n%\n2023\n-3.7 \n%\n-5.3 \n%\n-1.3 \n%\n0.9 \n%\n-2.4 \n%\n37\nTable of Contents\nProduct Performance\nOur products fall into two functional subsets: (1) OEM parts which become part of a customer's finished good and (2) MRO which provide for the maintenance, repair, and ongoing operations of a customer's facility.\nWhile certain products in our other product categories have an OEM application, such as welding consumables or metal cutting carbides, the majority of our sales for OEM applications are of fasteners. As a result, the best way to understand the change in our production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line (which represents 30% to 35%\n \nof our business). From a company perspective, the DSR changes of fasteners, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, were as follows (note: this information includes \nall\n end markets):\nDSR change - fasteners\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2024\n-4.4\n \n%\n-3.0\n \n%\n-4.0\n \n%\n-1.4\n \n%\n-3.3\n \n%\n2023\n7.0 \n%\n0.0 \n%\n-2.0 \n%\n-2.3 \n%\n0.7 \n%\nWe continued to experience a divergence in the performance of our fastener versus our non-fastener product lines in 2024.\nThis divergence was due in part to relatively weak performance from our fastener product line. Fasteners are more heavily oriented toward production of final goods than maintenance, which results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker industrial production, such as we experienced in 2024. In addition, due to its greater commodity content and shipping costs, fastener pricing can be more sensitive to cyclical trends. In 2024, weak business activity did contribute to slightly lower pricing for our fastener products.\nBy contrast, while we do sell significant quantities of MRO fasteners, the best way to understand the change in our MRO business is to examine the results in our non-fastener product lines, which include safety, tools, janitorial, and other products. From a company perspective, the DSR changes of non-fasteners, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, were as follows (note: this information includes \nall\n end markets):\nDSR change - non-fasteners\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2024\n5.2\n \n%\n4.2\n \n%\n4.7\n \n%\n4.3\n \n%\n4.6\n \n%\n2023\n10.3 \n%\n9.2 \n%\n7.5 \n%\n6.6 \n%\n8.4 \n%\nOur non-fastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles, but because it is more dependent on whether a facility is operating than how much product that facility is producing, it does tend to exhibit less volatility in its growth than our fastener business. We also expect growth of our non-fastener products to outperform growth of our fastener products over the course of a cycle. This reflects three things: the non-fastener market is larger than the fastener market, we are under penetrated in the non-fastener market relative to the fastener market, and industrial vending lends itself to sales of non-fastener products. The MRO orientation of our non-fastener category and our capabilities in vending played the greatest roles in the ability of our non-fastener products to outperform fasteners in 2024. \nGross Profit\nThe gross profit percentage during each period was as follows:\n \nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2024\n45.5\n \n%\n45.1\n \n%\n44.9\n \n%\n44.8\n \n%\n45.1\n \n%\n2023\n45.7 \n%\n45.5 \n%\n45.9 \n%\n45.5 \n%\n45.7 \n%\nOur gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.1% in 2024 and 45.7% in 2023. Our gross profit percentage was primarily impacted by two factors. First, we experienced unfavorable customer and product mix. This reflects relatively stronger growth from large customers, including Onsite customers, and non-fastener products, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we experienced product margin pressure. In safety, over the course of the year we incurred certain costs to support our customers' short-term operations, but also to prepare for incremental volumes that we expect to materialize in 2025. Other product lines exhibited stability in product margin throughout the year, but did not recover the margin pressure that was experienced in the latter part of 2023 and faced difficult comparisons year-over-year. These factors were only slightly offset by higher price-cost, which reflects the reversal in the first half of 2024 of the negative price-cost experienced in the first half of 2023.\nSG&A Expenses\nSG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 25.1% in 2024 from 24.9% in 2023. We continued to invest in areas, such as Onsite, technology and analytics personnel, and sales-related travel that we view as critical to supporting future growth. We managed expenses not directly related to customer acquisition and growth more tightly, but the overall level of investment produced negative leverage at the growth rates experienced in 2024.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other SG&A expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage \nof Total SG&A Expenses\nTwelve-month Period\n2024\n2023\nEmployee-related expenses\n70% to 75%\n3.2\n \n%\n3.4 \n%\nOccupancy-related expenses\n15% to 20%\n2.1\n \n%\n4.2 \n%\nAll other SG&A expenses\n10% to 15%\n8.1\n \n%\n4.2 \n%\nEmployee-related expenses include: (1) payroll (which includes cash compensation, stock option expense, and profit sharing), (2) health care, (3) personnel development, and (4) social taxes.\nOur employee-related expenses increased in 2024 from 2023. This was related to: higher base pay and employment taxes as a result of increased FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation; and higher healthcare costs due to growth in the number and size of claims. These factors were partly offset by a decline in bonuses and a decline in profit sharing reflecting slower sales and profit growth versus the prior year.\nThe table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period:\nTwelve-month Period\n2024\n2023\nSelling personnel \n(1)\n-0.1\n \n%\n4.1 \n%\nDistribution/Transportation personnel\n3.7\n \n%\n4.2 \n%\nManufacturing personnel\n3.7\n \n%\n0.1 \n%\nOrganizational support personnel \n(2)\n6.0\n \n%\n8.6 \n%\nTotal personnel\n1.1\n \n%\n4.4 \n%\n(1)\nOf our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location. \n(2)\nOrganizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (35% to 40% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) IT personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (22% to 27% of category), which includes human resources, FSB, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOccupancy-related expenses include: (1) building rent and depreciation, (2) building utility costs, (3) equipment related to our branches and distribution locations, and (4) industrial vending equipment and bins utilized as part of FMI services (we consider this hardware to be a logical extension of our in-market operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expenses).\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2024 from 2023. This was related to: moderately higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade, and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; and a slight rise in branch rents, which was more evident in 2024 than in preceding years as we are no longer actively reducing our branch locations and the associated costs.\nAll other SG&A expenses include: (1) selling-related transportation, (2) IT expenses, (3) general corporate expenses, which consists of legal expenses, general insurance expenses, travel and marketing expenses, etc., and (4) sales of property and equipment.\nCombined, all other SG&A expenses increased in 2024 from 2023. This was related to: selling-related transportation costs were higher reflecting higher lease costs as we refreshed our fleet of pick-ups, which more than offset lower fuel expense; higher expenses related to Fastenal-sponsored trade events, such as our Customer Expo held in April, and general marketing costs; higher spending on IT; and higher general insurance costs.\nNet Interest\nWe had higher interest income reflecting the investment of cash balances into higher earning short-term instruments throughout 2024 as part of a program we began in the fourth quarter of 2023. We had lower interest expense in 2024. We carried lower average borrowings relative to 2023 primarily from cash generated from working capital reductions enabling us to reduce outstanding revolver debt under our Credit Facility. The increase in interest income and the reduction in interest expense resulted in net interest expense of $1.9 in 2024 compared to $6.7 in 2023.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $357.5 in 2024, or 23.7% of income before income taxes, compared to $367.0 in 2023, or 24.1% of income before income taxes. We believe our ongoing tax rate, absent any discrete tax items or broader changes to tax law, will be approximately 24.5%. Our tax rate in 2024 was below our expected ongoing tax rate due to the tax benefits associated with (1) the exercise of stock options during the period and (2) return to provision adjustments processed during the year.\nNet Income\nNet income, net income per share, the percentage change in net income, and the percentage change in net income per share, were as follows:\nDollar Amounts\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\n1,150.6\n \n1,155.0 \nBasic net income per share\n2.01\n \n2.02 \nDiluted net income per share\n2.00\n \n2.02 \nPercentage Change\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n-0.4\n \n%\n6.3 \n%\nBasic net income per share\n-0.6\n \n%\n6.7 \n%\nDiluted net income per share\n-0.6\n \n%\n6.7 \n%\n2024\n2023\nTax Rate\n23.7\n \n%\n24.1 \n%\nDuring 2024, net income per share decreased. Volume growth in 2024 was not sufficient to produce SG&A leverage that could offset mix-related gross margin contraction, resulting in operating margin contraction that was only partially offset by our modest growth in sales, lower net interest expense, and a more favorable tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net income were as follows:\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided\n$\n1,173.3\n \n1,432.7 \n% of net income\n102.0\n \n%\n124.0 \n%\nIn 2024, we experienced a decrease in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net income. The decrease in operating cash flow, as a percent of net income, primarily reflects our operating assets and liabilities being a use of cash in 2024 as compared to a source of cash in 2023. This was primarily attributable to investing in inventory in 2024 as opposed to reducing inventory in 2023.\n40\nTable of Contents\nTrade Working Capital Assets\nThe following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31:\n \nTwelve-month \nDollar Change\nTwelve-month \nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2024\n2024\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n1,108.6\n \n21.0 \n1.9 \n%\nInventories\n1,645.0\n \n122.3 \n8.0 \n%\nTrade working capital\n$\n2,753.6\n \n143.3 \n5.5 \n%\nAccounts payable\n$\n287.7\n \n23.6 \n8.9 \n%\nTrade working capital, net\n$\n2,465.9\n \n119.7 \n5.1 \n%\nNet sales in last three months\n$\n1,824.5\n \n65.9 \n3.7 \n%\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nThe increase in our accounts receivable balance in 2024 was primarily attributable to growth in sales to our customers.\nOur inventory balances over time will respond to business activity, though various factors produce a looser relationship to our monthly sales patterns than we tend to experience in accounts receivable. One reason for this is because it is cyclical. We source significant quantities of product from overseas, and the lead time involved in procuring these products is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns. As a result, trends in our inventory will often lag trends in economic conditions. A second reason relates to product cost and the length of our supply chain. A significant proportion of our products, particularly fasteners, are sourced from Asia and transported primarily by ship and rail to our North American network for sale. This requires us to purchase a meaningful quantity of our products months in advance of those products being available for sale in our North American facilities. Product that is in transit is in our inventory but is not available for sale, which can create a lag in our ability to adjust inventory levels or costs in response to rapid changes in economic or cost conditions. A third factor that tends to require incremental inventory increases over time is our growth drivers, including our FMI offerings, Onsite channel, and international expansion, all of which tend to require significant investments in inventory.\nThe increase in our inventory balance in 2024 was primarily attributable to three factors. First, our inventory increased as a result of growth in sales to our customers and the addition of stock to ensure we can support our customers' future growth. Second, we added $30.0 to $35.0 in stock to improve service to our in-market locations and generate efficiencies in our hubs. Third, we took advantage of year-end opportunities arising from our suppliers' desire to reduce inventory at year-end. These factors were partially offset by the effects of soft underlying business activity and modest product cost deflation.\nThe increase in our accounts payable balance in 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in our product purchases as reflected in the growth in inventories.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end:\n2024\n2023\nSelling locations\n59\n \n%\n64 \n%\nDistribution center and manufacturing locations\n41\n \n%\n36 \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100 \n%\nLease Obligations\nWe have facilities, equipment, and vehicles leased under operating leases.

This increase was primarily related to investments for net capital expenditures.\nProperty and equipment expenditures typically consist primarily of: (1) purchases related to FMI hardware, (2) purchases of property and equipment related to expansion of and enhancements to distribution centers, owned or leased branch properties, and other company facilities, (3) spending on software and hardware for our information processing systems, (4) the addition of fleet vehicles, and (5) the addition of manufacturing equipment. Proceeds from the sales of property and equipment, typically for the planned disposition of pick-up trucks as well as distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business, are netted against these purchases and additions.\nSet forth below is a recap of our 2024 and 2023 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net income:\n2024\n2023\nManufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities\n$\n145.8\n \n83.9 \nShelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations\n23.5\n \n24.0 \nData processing software and equipment\n25.5\n \n33.4 \nReal estate and improvements to branch locations\n8.7\n \n7.0 \nVehicles\n23.0\n \n24.5 \nPurchases of property and equipment\n226.5\n \n172.8 \nProceeds from sale of property and equipment\n(12.4)\n(12.2)\nNet capital expenditures\n214.1\n \n160.6 \n% of net sales\n2.8\n \n%\n2.2 \n%\n% of net income\n18.6\n \n%\n13.9 \n%\nOur net capital expenditures in 2024 increased when compared to 2023, though they were below our anticipated range of $235.0 to $255.0 for the year. This was primarily related to two factors. First, there was less demand to install incremental picking modules in our in-market locations than we anticipated. Second, spending on FMI hardware was lower, primarily as a result of lower FASTBin signings and installations than anticipated. \nFor 2025, we expect our investment in property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, to be within a range of $265.0 to $285.0, an increase from $214.1 in 2024. This increase reflects three items. First, we expect elevated IT spending as projects that were planned in 2024, but experienced delays, are now expected to occur in 2025. Second, we expect higher distribution center spending to complete our upgraded Utah hub, begin construction on a new Atlanta hub, and improve our picking capacity and efficiency across our hub network. Third, we expect greater outlays for FMI hardware reflecting an increase in our targeted signings.\n42\nTable of Contents\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of income were as follows:\n2024\n2023\nCash dividends paid\n$\n893.3\n \n1,016.8 \n% of net income\n77.6\n \n%\n88.0 \n%\nTotal returned to shareholders\n$\n893.3\n \n1,016.8 \n% of net income\n77.6\n \n%\n88.0 \n%\nProceeds from the exercise of stock options\n$\n(39.6)\n(30.1)\n% of net income\n-3.4\n \n%\n-2.6 \n%\nDebt obligations payments (proceeds), net\n$\n60.0\n \n295.0 \n% of net income\n5.2\n \n%\n25.5 \n%\nNet cash used\n$\n913.7\n \n1,281.7 \nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities reflects two factors. First, we had lower dividend payments. While we increased regular dividend payments in 2024 by 11.7%, in the fourth quarter of 2023 we paid a special fifth dividend that did not recur in 2024. Second, we used less cash to reduce outstanding debt obligations in 2024 than we did in 2023, primarily because we carried lower balances on our Credit Facility throughout 2024. These uses of cash were only partly offset by an increase in the exercise of stock options.\nDividends\nWe declared a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share on January 16, 2025. In 2024, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.56. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.78, which included $1.40 per share in regular quarterly dividends and a $0.38 per share special dividend paid in December 2023.\nStock Purchases\nWe did not purchase any of our common stock in 2024 or 2023.\nWe have authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization does not have an expiration date.\nDebt\nIn order to fund the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business, expand capacity and increase the use of automation in our distribution centers, and pay dividends, we have borrowed under our Credit Facility and our Master Note Agreement in recent periods.\nOur borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2024 as follows:\nPeak borrowings\n2024\nFirst quarter\n$\n390.0\n \nSecond quarter\n300.0\n \nThird quarter\n305.0\n \nFourth quarter\n300.0\n \n43\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $0.0 outstanding under the Credit Facility and had contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility in an aggregate face amount of $31.2. As of December 31, 2024, we had loans outstanding under the Master Note Agreement of $200.0. Descriptions of our Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement are contained in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements for known contractual obligations include capital expenditures, debt, and lease obligations, each of which are discussed in more detail earlier in this section. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for these items in the short-term over the next 12 months and also in the long-term beyond the next 12 months. We also have cash requirements for purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services, which are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities. In addition, we may have liabilities for uncertain tax positions but we do not believe any of these liabilities will be material. A discussion of income taxes is contained in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnremitted Foreign Income\nApproximately $197.5 of cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries on December 31, 2024. These funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash. We have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the U.S., even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe observed very modest deflationary conditions in 2024, primarily for fasteners. Most inputs, including steel, energy, and domestic transportation costs, experienced price levels that were stable to slightly down during the year,  resulting in sustained slight deflation in our inventory and slightly lower pricing affecting our sales. However, given the immaterial impact of these changes on our financials, we did not institute any broad pricing actions through 2024. The primary exception to the modestly deflationary tenor of the marketplace in 2024 was in transportation costs for imported goods, where we experienced inflation in container rates through much of 2024. We took actions to mitigate these effects in the latter part of the year. The combined net effect on our gross profit percentage of these trends in cost and price inflation was immaterial in 2024.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPRIOR YEAR RESULTS ENDED 2023\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth consolidated statements of income information (as a percentage of net sales) for the periods ended December 31:\n \n2023\n2022\nNet sales\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nGross profit\n45.7 \n%\n46.1 \n%\nSG&A expenses\n24.9 \n%\n25.2 \n%\nOperating income\n20.8 \n%\n20.8 \n%\nNet interest expense\n-0.1 \n%\n-0.2 \n%\nIncome before income taxes\n20.7 \n%\n20.6 \n%\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales\nThe table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended December 31, and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period:\n2023\n2022\nNet sales\n$\n7,346.7 \n6,980.6 \nPercentage change\n5.2 \n%\n16.1 \n%\nBusiness days\n253 \n254 \nDaily sales\n$\n29.0 \n27.5 \nPercentage change\n5.7 \n%\n15.7 \n%\nDaily sales impact of currency fluctuations\n-0.3 \n%\n-0.5 \n%\nThe increase in net sales noted above for 2023 was due to higher unit sales of MRO, OEM, and construction supplies, as well as higher pricing as further set forth below.\nWe believe higher unit sales in 2023 were primarily a result of our ability to gain market share, as most measures of industrial activity were flat to down throughout the period. Despite this challenging environment, in 2023 we produced net sales growth of 5.2% and, owing to one fewer selling day in the period, daily sales growth of 5.7%. Growth was led by our transportation customers, which includes sales to transportation services customers as the warehousing operations of retailer-oriented customers, and manufacturing end markets, which benefit disproportionately from our shift to a key account model. Our non-residential construction and reseller customers contracted during the period, which we believe is due to our shift to a key account model which tends to de-emphasize walk-in, over-the-counter, and infrequent transactions.\nPrice contributed 160 to 190 basis points to our net sales growth in 2023. This contribution to growth from price was primarily due to easier comparisons in the first six months of 2023. For instance, in the first six months of 2023 contribution to growth from price averaged 240 to 270 basis points, while in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 contribution to growth from price averaged 110 to 140 basis points and 50 to 80 basis points, respectively.\nWe increased total Onsite locations, the installed base of FMI devices, and our Digital Footprint in 2023, which enhanced the value we provide to our customers and supported our growth and efficiency. The rate of penetration we achieved with these growth drivers was uneven, however. We signed 326 Onsites in 2023, below our goal at the start of 2023 of 375 to 400 units and slightly below the prior year signings of 356 units. We signed 24,126 FMI MEUs, meeting our goal at the start of 2023 of 23,000 to 25,000 MEUs and meaningfully above the prior year signings of 20,735 MEUs. We expanded the proportion of our sales running through our Digital Footprint to 56.1%, below our goal at the start of 2023 of 65.0% but above the prior year level of 49.3%.\n45\nTable of Contents\nSales by Product Line\nFrom a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners (including fasteners used in OEM and MRO), safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. The percent of sales in the periods below were as follows:\n2023\n2022\nOEM fasteners\n20.1 \n%\n20.4 \n%\nMRO fasteners\n12.3 \n%\n13.6 \n%\nTotal fasteners\n32.4 \n%\n34.0 \n%\nSafety supplies\n21.2 \n%\n20.8 \n%\nOther product lines\n46.4 \n%\n45.2 \n%\nTotal non-fasteners\n67.6 \n%\n66.0 \n%\nThe shifts in product mix in 2023 compared to 2022 are largely attributable to two factors. First, fasteners are more heavily oriented toward production of final goods than maintenance, which results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker industrial production. Second, pricing for fasteners has decelerated at a faster pace than non-fastener products. These dynamics produced a meaningful divergence in the daily sales growth rates of our fastener versus our non-fastener product lines in 2023.\nAnnual Sales Changes, Sequential Trends, and End Market Performance\nThis section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a month to the immediately preceding month, and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.\nAnnual Sales Changes, by Month\nDuring the months noted below, all of our selling locations, when combined, had a DSR change of (compared to the same month in the preceding year):\n \nJan.\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAug.\nSept.\nOct.\nNov.\nDec.\n2023\n11.2 \n%\n9.6 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n7.8 \n%\n5.2 \n%\n4.7 \n%\n3.7 \n%\n3.6 \n%\n5.0 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n3.8 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n2022\n14.9 \n%\n21.3 \n%\n19.1 \n%\n20.3 \n%\n17.6 \n%\n16.0 \n%\n18.1 \n%\n16.1 \n%\n13.7 \n%\n13.6 \n%\n10.2 \n%\n8.0 \n%\nSequential Trends\nThe table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled 'Benchmark' is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average that excludes 2020. We have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends. We believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark. The '2023' and '2022' lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The '23Delta' and '22Delta' lines indicate the difference between the 'Benchmark' and the actual results in the respective year. Under normal circumstances, the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. Further, in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark.\n46\nTable of Contents\nIt is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages. In a year where demand is strong, our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it. In a year where demand is weak, we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it. In both cases, there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform and puts greater relevance on performance trends over multiple periods.\nJan. \n(1)\nFeb.\nMar.\nApr.\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAug.\nSept.\nOct.\nCumulative \nChange from \nJan. to Oct.\nBenchmark \n(2)\n0.2 \n%\n1.5 \n%\n3.8 \n%\n-0.5 \n%\n2.7 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n-3.1 \n%\n2.9 \n%\n3.6 \n%\n-1.9 \n%\n11.2 \n%\n2023\n-0.4 \n%\n1.7 \n%\n1.0 \n%\n-0.2 \n%\n0.7 \n%\n-0.2 \n%\n-2.6 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n-3.0 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n23Delta\n-0.6 \n%\n0.1 \n%\n-2.9 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n-2.0 \n%\n-2.1 \n%\n0.5 \n%\n-1.6 \n%\n0.4 \n%\n-1.1 \n%\n-8.8 \n%\n2022\n1.7 \n%\n3.1 \n%\n3.6 \n%\n-1.2 \n%\n3.2 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n-1.6 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n2.7 \n%\n-0.1 \n%\n11.7 \n%\n22Delta\n1.5 \n%\n1.6 \n%\n-0.2 \n%\n-0.7 \n%\n0.6 \n%\n-1.7 \n%\n1.5 \n%\n-1.6 \n%\n-0.9 \n%\n1.8 \n%\n0.5 \n%\n(1)\nThe January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.\n(2)\nThe benchmark for each month is the average of the previous five years for that month. As COVID-19-related surge sales made sequential averages in 2020 unrepresentative, the benchmark uses a preceding five-year average that \nexcludes\n 2020. We also exclude the impact of the 2017 Mansco acquisition.\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nA graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above, starting with a base of '100' in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows:\nEnd Market Performance\nThe DSR changes to our manufacturing customers, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, were as follows:\nDSR change - manufacturing customers\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2023\n14.4 \n%\n10.4 \n%\n6.2 \n%\n4.7 \n%\n8.9 \n%\n2022\n23.9 \n%\n23.1 \n%\n22.6 \n%\n16.0 \n%\n21.3 \n%\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe DSR changes to our non-manufacturing customers, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, was as follows:\nDSR change - non-manufacturing customers\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2023\n-3.7 \n%\n-5.3 \n%\n-1.3 \n%\n0.9 \n%\n-2.4 \n%\n2022\n6.9 \n%\n6.9 \n%\n1.0 \n%\n-0.8 \n%\n3.5 \n%\nProduct Performance\nFrom a company perspective, the DSR changes of fasteners, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, were as follows (note: this information includes \nall\n end markets):\nDSR change - fasteners\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2023\n7.0 \n%\n0.0 \n%\n-2.0 \n%\n-2.3 \n%\n0.7 \n%\n2022\n24.6 \n%\n21.2 \n%\n18.2 \n%\n9.1 \n%\n18.1 \n%\nFrom a company perspective, the DSR changes of non-fasteners, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, were as follows (note: this information includes \nall\n end markets):\nDSR change - non-fasteners\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2023\n10.3 \n%\n9.2 \n%\n7.5 \n%\n6.6 \n%\n8.4 \n%\n2022\n15.0 \n%\n16.0 \n%\n14.4 \n%\n11.6 \n%\n14.2 \n%\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit percentage during each period was as follows:\n \nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nAnnual\n2023\n45.7 \n%\n45.5 \n%\n45.9 \n%\n45.5 \n%\n45.7 \n%\n2022\n46.6 \n%\n46.5 \n%\n45.9 \n%\n45.3 \n%\n46.1 \n%\nOur gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.7% in 2023 and 46.1% in 2022. This decrease was primarily related to two factors. First, in 2023 customer and product mix had a negative effect on our gross profit percentage. We continued to experience relatively strong growth from larger customers, including Onsites, and non-fastener products, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we had higher organizational/overhead costs, including from higher inbound freight costs and working capital needs being relieved from inventory and generating higher period costs. These negative effects were partly offset by favorable freight costs, which reflects elevated domestic freight sales leveraging what are relatively stable costs to support our captive fleet, lower expenses related to external freight providers, and lower fuel costs.\nSG&A Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, improved to 24.9% in 2023 from 25.2% in 2022. This primarily reflected improvement, as a percentage of net sales, in employee-related expenses as bonuses and commissions were down as a result of slower sales and profit growth in 2023 versus the prior year.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other SG&A expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage \nof Total SG&A Expenses\nTwelve-month Period\n2023\n2022\nEmployee-related expenses\n70% to 75%\n3.4 \n%\n14.7 \n%\nOccupancy-related expenses\n15% to 20%\n4.2 \n%\n2.6 \n%\nAll other SG&A expenses\n10% to 15%\n4.2 \n%\n18.5 \n%\nOur employee-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to higher base pay and employment taxes as a result of increased FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation. This was partly offset by a decline in bonuses reflecting slower sales and profit growth versus the prior year.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period:\nTwelve-month Period\n2023\n2022\nSelling personnel \n(1)\n4.1 \n%\n7.9 \n%\nDistribution/Transportation personnel\n4.2 \n%\n8.4 \n%\nManufacturing personnel\n0.1 \n%\n12.4 \n%\nOrganizational support personnel \n(2)\n8.6 \n%\n9.5 \n%\nTotal personnel\n4.4 \n%\n8.3 \n%\n(1)\nOf our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location. \n(2)\nOrganizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) IT personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, FSB, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: slightly higher depreciation and expenses related to a higher installed base of our FMI suite of technologies; moderately higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade, and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; and a slight rise in branch rents related to higher inflation and branch size.\nCombined, all other SG&A expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: higher spending on IT; higher general insurance costs; increased spending on travel and supplies; and higher bad debt expense. These elements were only partly offset by increased contributions from our \nsupplier collaboration programs and \nincreased income from asset sales related to our field truck fleet\n.\nNet Interest\nOur net interest expense was $6.7 in 2023 compared to $13.6 in 2022. We carried lower average debt balances in 2023 relative to the prior year, with cash generated from working capital reductions enabling us to reduce outstanding revolver debt under our Credit Facility. This was only partly offset by slightly higher average rates against borrowings under our Credit Facility due to changing interest rate levels in the marketplace. We also generated higher interest income in 2023 relative to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $367.0 in 2023, or 24.1% of income before income taxes, compared to $353.1 in 2022, or 24.5% of income before income taxes. The decrease in our tax rate in 2023 is due primarily to an increase in the tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options.\nNet Income\nNet income, net income per share, the percentage change in net income, and the percentage change in net income per share, were as follows:\nDollar Amounts\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n1,155.0 \n1,086.9 \nBasic net income per share\n2.02 \n1.89 \nDiluted net income per share\n2.02 \n1.89 \nPercentage Change\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n6.3 \n%\n17.5 \n%\nBasic net income per share\n6.7 \n%\n17.7 \n%\nDiluted net income per share\n6.7 \n%\n17.8 \n%\n2023\n2022\nTax Rate\n24.1 \n%\n24.5 \n%\nDuring 2023, net income per share increased, primarily due to higher sales, lower net interest expense, a lower tax rate, and lower average fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of our buying back shares in 2022.\n49\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net income were as follows:\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided\n$\n1,432.7 \n941.0 \n% of net income\n124.0 \n%\n86.6 \n%\nIn 2023, we experienced an increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net income. The improvement in operating cash flow in 2023, as a percent of net income, reflects the reduced demand for working capital as a result of an improved supply chain and, to a lesser degree, slower business activity relative to the prior year.\nTrade Working Capital Assets\nThe following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31:\n \nTwelve-month \nDollar Change\nTwelve-month \nPercentage Change\n \n2023\n2023\n2023\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n1,087.6 \n74.4 \n7.3 \n%\nInventories\n1,522.7 \n(185.3)\n-10.8 \n%\nTrade working capital\n$\n2,610.3 \n(110.9)\n-4.1 \n%\nAccounts payable\n$\n264.1 \n9.2 \n3.6 \n%\nTrade working capital, net\n$\n2,346.2 \n(120.1)\n-4.9 \n%\nNet sales in last three months\n$\n1,758.6 \n63.0 \n3.7 \n%\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in net accounts receivable is primarily attributable to three factors. First, our receivables increased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our mix due to relatively stronger growth from national account customers, which tend to carry longer payment terms than our non-national account customers. Third, and to a lesser degree, customers have historically delayed payments at the end of years that are economically challenged, and we saw that effect in 2023.\nIn 2023, our inventories decreased, reflecting the absence of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. Our response at the time was to deepen our inventory as a means of maintaining high service to our customers, particularly for imported inventory. Dissipation of these disruptions has allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle. It is also likely that slower business activity reduced the level of inventory our customers required us to maintain to meet their production needs.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in accounts payable was primarily attributable to our product purchases increasing to support the growth in our business. The growth in our accounts payable balance is below the growth in our sales, which reflects the dissipation of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. This allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle in 2023 versus 2022.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end:\n2023\n2022\nSelling locations\n64 \n%\n58 \n%\nDistribution center and manufacturing locations\n36 \n%\n42 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n50\nTable of Contents\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net income were as follows:\n2023\n2022\nNet cash used\n$\n161.2 \n163.0 \n% of net income\n14.0 \n%\n15.0 \n%\nOur net cash used in investing activities in 2023 was comparable to 2022 and primarily related to investments for net capital expenditures.\nSet forth below is a recap of our 2023 and 2022 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net income:\n2023\n2022\nManufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities\n$\n83.9 \n97.8 \nShelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations\n24.0 \n21.5 \nData processing software and equipment\n33.4 \n30.6 \nReal estate and improvements to branch locations\n7.0 \n12.4 \nVehicles\n24.5 \n11.5 \nPurchases of property and equipment\n172.8 \n173.8 \nProceeds from sale of property and equipment\n(12.2)\n(11.4)\nNet capital expenditures\n160.6 \n162.4 \n% of net sales\n2.2 \n%\n2.3 \n%\n% of net income\n13.9 \n%\n14.9 \n%\nOur net capital expenditures in 2023 were comparable to 2022, though they were below our original expectations for net capital investment during the year. The slower business environment in 2023 reduced the need to purchase certain equipment at the pace originally anticipated. We also saw the timing of certain outlays pushed out and, to a lesser extent, longer lead times on certain materials. It does not reflect the cancellation of any significant initiatives.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of income were as follows:\n2023\n2022\nCash dividends paid\n$\n1,016.8 \n711.3 \n% of net income\n88.0 \n%\n65.4 \n%\nPurchases of common stock\n— \n237.8 \n% of net income\n— \n%\n21.9 \n%\nTotal returned to shareholders\n$\n1,016.8 \n949.1 \n% of net income\n88.0 \n%\n87.3 \n%\nProceeds from the exercise of stock options\n$\n(30.1)\n(9.2)\n% of net income\n-2.6 \n%\n-0.8 \n%\nDebt obligations payments (proceeds), net\n$\n295.0 \n(165.0)\n% of net income\n25.5 \n%\n-15.2 \n%\nNet cash used\n$\n1,281.7 \n774.9 \nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities reflects higher dividend payments, including a supplemental payment in December of 2023, and a reduction in our outstanding debt obligations. These uses of cash were only partly offset by the absence of common stock purchases that we made in the prior year and, to a lesser degree, the exercise of stock options.\n51\nTable of Contents\nDividends\nWe declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share on January 17, 2024. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.78. This included $1.40 per share in regular quarterly dividends and a $0.38 per share special dividend paid in December 2023 reflecting what was at the time our high cash balances, as well as our favorable outlook for future cash generation. In 2022, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24.\nStock Purchases\nIn 2023, we did not purchase any of our common stock. In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $47.58 per share.\nWe have authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization does not have an expiration date.\nDebt\nOur borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2023 as follows:\nPeak borrowings\n2023\nFirst quarter\n$\n565.0 \nSecond quarter\n470.0 \nThird quarter\n350.0 \nFourth quarter\n330.0 \nEffects of Inflation\nIn 2023, we observed easing in inflationary pressures for metals (especially steel), energy, and transportation services (especially overseas containers and shipping) resulting in stable costs for most of our product offering. As a result, we did not institute any broad pricing actions through 2023 and we saw our contribution to growth in daily sales due to price moderate throughout the year. The exception to this stability was cost deflation for imported goods, which resulted in modest price deflation specifically in our fastener product line over the course of the year. The net effect on our gross profit percentage of these trends in cost and price inflation was immaterial in 2023.\n52\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, and expenses, and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nOur most significant accounting policies, including Revenue Recognition and Inventories, are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (ii) different estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations. Our most critical accounting estimates include the following:\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n – This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables, considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts and our estimation and assumption methods have not materially changed during 2024.\nInventory valuation\n – Adjustments to the valuation of inventory are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels, sales information, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Our methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, market conditions, condition of the inventory, or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required adjustments have not varied materially from estimated amounts and our estimation and assumption methods have not materially changed during 2024.\nGeneral insurance reserves\n – These reserves are for general claims related to workers' compensation, property and casualty losses, and other general liability self-insured losses. The reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends. We perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels. We analyze historical trends, claims experience, and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts and our estimation and assumption methods have not materially changed during 2024.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, if any, is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n53\nTable of Contents",
