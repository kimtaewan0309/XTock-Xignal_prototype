These statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. We have tried, whenever possible, to identify these statements by using words like “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “depends,” “expect,” “goal,” “aspiration,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “project,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “target,” “indicate,” “outlook,” and similar expressions of future intent or the negative of such terms. \nBecause forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are many factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. This note contains important cautionary statements of the known factors that we consider could materially affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nEvents and conditions around the world, including geopolitical uncertainty, war and other military actions, pandemics, inflation, higher fuel prices, higher interest rates and other general concerns impacting the ability or desire of people to travel could lead to a decline in demand for cruises as well as have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operations.\n•\nIncidents concerning our ships, guests or the cruise industry may negatively impact the satisfaction of our guests and crew and lead to reputational damage. \n•\nChanges in and non-compliance with laws and regulations under which we operate, such as those relating to health, environment, safety and security, data privacy and protection, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, economic sanctions, trade protection, labor and employment, and tax may be costly and lead to litigation, enforcement actions, fines, penalties and reputational damage. \n•\nFactors associated with climate change, including evolving and increasing regulations, increasing concerns about climate change and the shift in climate conscious consumerism and stakeholder scrutiny, and increasing frequency and/or severity of adverse weather conditions could have a material impact on our business.\n•\nInability to meet or achieve our targets, goals, aspirations, initiatives, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, including those related to sustainability matters, may expose us to risks that may adversely impact our business.\n•\nCybersecurity incidents and data privacy breaches, as well as disruptions and other damages to our principal offices, information technology operations and system networks and failure to keep pace with developments in technology have adversely impacted and may in the future materially adversely impact our business operations, the satisfaction of our guests and crew and may lead to fines, penalties and reputational damage. \n•\nThe loss of key team members, our inability to recruit or retain qualified shoreside and shipboard team members and increased labor costs could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n•\nIncreases in fuel prices, changes in the types of fuel consumed and availability of fuel supply may adversely impact our scheduled itineraries and costs.\n•\nWe rely on suppliers who are integral to the operations of our businesses. These suppliers and service providers may be unable to deliver on their commitments, which could negatively impact our business.\n•\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial results. \n•\nOvercapacity and competition in the cruise and land-based vacation industry may negatively impact our cruise sales, pricing and destination options.\n•\nInability to implement our shipbuilding programs and ship repairs, maintenance and refurbishments may adversely impact our business operations and the satisfaction of our guests. \n•\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including those beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate cash required to service our debt and sustain our operations.\n•\nOur debt could adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility. \nThe ordering of the risk factors set forth above is not intended to reflect our indication of priority or likelihood. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. \n23\nTable of Content\nForward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant stock exchange rules, we expressly disclaim any obligation to disseminate, after the date of this document, any updates or revisions to any such forward-looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based. \nForward-looking and other statements in this document may also address our sustainability progress, plans, and goals (including climate change- and environmental-related matters). In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking sustainability- and climate-related statements may be based on standards and tools for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions and predictions that are subject to change in the future and may not be generally shared.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 - \n“\nGeneral, Accounting Pronouncements\n”\n of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding \nAccounting Pronouncements\n.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \nFor a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” that is included in the Form 10-K. \nSeasonality\nOur passenger ticket revenues are seasonal. Demand for cruises has been greatest during our third quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months. This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher ticket prices and occupancy levels and, accordingly, the largest share of our operating income is typically earned during this period. Our results are also impacted by ships being taken out-of-service for planned maintenance, which we schedule during non-peak seasons. In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours’ revenue and operating income is generated from May through September in conjunction with Alaska’s cruise season.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\n•\nWe believe the volatility in the cost of fuel is reasonably likely to impact our profitability in both the short and long-term.\n•\nWe believe the increasing focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and new and evolving related regulatory requirements, are reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on our future financial results. We became subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) on January 1, 2024, which includes a three-year phase-in period. The impact of this regulation in 2024 was $46 million, which represented costs associated with 40% of emissions under the ETS operational scope. In 2025, 70% of emissions under the ETS scope will be impacted, and in 2026, all in scope emissions will be impacted.\n24\nTable of Content\nStatistical Information\nThree Months Ended \nAugust 31,\nNine Months Ended\nAugust 31,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nPassenger Cruise Days (“PCDs”) \n(in millions) \n(a)\n27.5 \n28.1 \n77.1 \n76.0 \nAvailable Lower Berth Days (“ALBDs”)\n (in millions) \n(b) (c)\n24.6 \n25.2 \n72.3 \n71.7 \nOccupancy percentage (d)\n112 \n%\n112 \n%\n107 \n%\n106 \n%\nPassengers carried\n (in millions)\n3.8 \n3.9 \n10.3 \n10.3 \nFuel consumption in metric tons \n(in millions)\n0.7 \n0.7 \n2.1 \n2.2 \nFuel consumption in metric tons per thousand ALBDs\n28.0 \n29.5 \n29.4 \n31.0 \nFuel cost per metric ton consumed (excluding European Union Allowance (“EU Allowances”))\n$\n607 \n$\n670 \n$\n621 \n$\n680 \nCurrencies (USD to 1)\nAUD\n$\n0.65 \n$\n0.67 \n$\n0.64 \n$\n0.66 \nCAD\n$\n0.73 \n$\n0.73 \n$\n0.71 \n$\n0.74 \nEUR\n$\n1.16 \n$\n1.09 \n$\n1.10 \n$\n1.08 \nGBP\n$\n1.35 \n$\n1.28 \n$\n1.30 \n$\n1.27 \nNotes to Statistical Information\n(a)\nPCD represents the number of cruise passengers on a voyage multiplied by the number of revenue-producing ship operating days for that voyage.\n(b)\nALBD is a standard measure of passenger capacity for the period that we use to approximate rate and capacity variances, based on consistently applied formulas that we use to perform analyses to determine the main non-capacity driven factors that cause our cruise revenues and expenses to vary. ALBDs assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period.\n(c)\nFor the three months ended August 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024, we had a 2.5% capacity decrease in ALBDs comprised of a 3.1% capacity decrease in our North America segment and a 1.5% capacity decrease in our Europe segment.\nOur North America segment’s capacity decrease was driven by the following:\n•\nSeabourn 460-passenger capacity ship that left the fleet in September 2024\n•\nP&O Cruises (Australia) 2,000-passenger capacity ship that left the fleet in February 2025\nOur Europe segment’s capacity decrease was driven by fewer ship operating days in 2025 compared to 2024.\nFor the nine months ended August 31, 2025 compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we had a 0.9% capacity increase in ALBDs comprised of a 0.8% capacity increase in our North America segment and a 1.2% capacity increase in our Europe segment.\nOur North America segment’s capacity increase was caused by the following:\n•\nCarnival Cruise Line 5,360-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in December 2023\n•\nPrincess Cruises 4,310-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in February 2024\n•\nCarnival Cruise Line 4,130-passenger capacity ship that was transferred from Costa Cruises and entered into service in April 2024\nOur North America segment’s capacity increase was partially offset by:\n•\nSeabourn 460-passenger capacity ship that left the fleet in September 2024\n•\nP&O Cruises (Australia) 2,000-passenger capacity ship that left the fleet in February 2025\n25\nTable of Content\nOur Europe segment’s capacity increase was caused by: \n•\nCunard 2,960-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in May 2024\n•\nNonrecurrence of the Red Sea rerouting without guests\nThe increase in our Europe segment’s capacity was partially offset by a Costa Cruises 4,240-passenger capacity ship that transferred to Carnival Cruise Line in February 2024.\n(d)\nOccupancy, in accordance with cruise industry practice, is calculated using a numerator of PCDs and a denominator of ALBDs, which assumes two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more passengers. Percentages in excess of 100% indicate that on average more than two passengers occupied some cabins.\nThree Months Ended August 31, 2025 (“2025”) Compared to Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 (“2024”)\nRevenues\nConsolidated\nPassenger ticket revenues made up 67% of our 2025 total revenues.

In additio\nn, we had \n$8.7 billion\n of undrawn export credit facilities to fund ship deliveries planned through \n2033\n. \nRefer to Note \n3\n - “Debt” of the consolidated financial statements and Funding Sources below for additional details.\nWe had a working capital deficit of \n$7.6 billion\n as of August 31, 2025 compared to a working capital deficit of $8.2 billion as of November 30, 2024. The decrease in working capital deficit was caused by an increase in cash and cash equivalents and decreases in accrued liabilities and other and current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in customer deposits. We operate with a substantial working capital deficit. This deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that, under our business model, substantially all of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date. These advance passenger receipts generally remain a current liability on our balance sheet until the sailing date. The cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources, such as our borrowings and other cash from operations. The cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses, pay down our debt, make long-term investments or any other use of cash. Included within our working capital are \n$6.7 billion\n and $6.4 billion of current customer deposits as of August 31, 2025 and November 30, 2024. We have agreements with a number of credit card processors that transact customer deposits related to our cruise vacations. Certain of these agreements allow the credit card processors to request, under certain circumstances, that we provide a capped reserve fund in cash.
