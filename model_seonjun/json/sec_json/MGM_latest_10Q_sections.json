Please see “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related notes thereto and the other disclosures contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, which were included in our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 18, 2025. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods. MGM Resorts International together with its subsidiaries may be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” \nUpdates to Strategic Business Developments\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the competitive and economic assumptions underpinning our return expectations on our investment in a commercial gaming facility changed, which led us to determine we would withdraw our application for a commercial gaming license for Empire City. As such, in the third quarter of 2025, we recorded an impairment of the full amount of the Empire City reporting unit’s goodwill of $256 million and charges for write-downs and impairments within “Property transactions, net” of $93 million, of which charges primarily consist of the impairment of $52 million relating to Empire City’s existing gaming license. We will instead continue to operate Empire City in its current format.\nIn October 2025, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of MGM Northfield Park for $546 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Upon closing, the master lease between us and VICI will be amended to remove MGM Northfield Park and to reflect a $53 million reduction in annual cash rent, subject to a 2% escalator on May 1, 2026. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. \nKey Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are: \n•\nGaming revenue indicators: table games drop, which is the total amount of cash and net markers issued and deposited into the drop box, and slot handle, which is the gross amount wagered in slot machines, (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. “Win” or “hold” percentages represent the net amount of gaming wins and losses in relation to table games drop or slot handle; and\n•\nHotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts) – hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“RevPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.\n21\nResults of Operations\nSummary Operating Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results:\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n \n(In thousands)\nNet revenues\n$\n4,250,464 \n$\n4,183,138 \n$\n12,932,416 \n$\n12,893,983 \nOperating income (loss)\n(112,852)\n314,857 \n676,770 \n1,198,891 \nNet income (loss)\n(206,729)\n244,164 \n138,096 \n826,692 \nNet income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International\n(285,255)\n184,578 \n(87,750)\n589,126 \nConsolidated net revenues increased 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to MGM China increasing 17% and MGM Digital increasing 23%, partially offset by Las Vegas Strip Resorts decreasing 7%, and Regional Operations flat, each as compared to the prior year quarter and as discussed below.\nConsolidated operating loss was $113 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to operating income of $315 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was due primarily to $256 million of goodwill impairment related to Empire City, $93 million of write-offs and impairments related to Empire City recorded within property transactions, net, and an increase in gaming taxes incurred primarily at MGM China, partially offset by an increase in net revenues discussed above.\nConsolidated net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were flat compared to the prior year period due primarily to MGM China increasing 7%, MGM Digital increasing 13%, and Regional Operations increasing 1%, offset by Las Vegas Strip Resorts decreasing 5%, each as compared to the period year period.\nConsolidated operating income decreased 44% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due primarily to $256 million of goodwill impairment related to Empire City, $93 million of write-offs and impairments related to Empire City recorded within property transactions, net, an increase in gaming taxes incurred primarily at MGM China, and depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $117 million compared to the prior year period due primarily to recently completed capital projects.\n22\nNet Revenues by Segment\nThe following table

Las Vegas Strip Resorts Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 30.3% for the \n25\nthree months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 34.3% in the prior year quarter due primarily to the decrease in net revenues, as discussed above.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts Segment Adjusted EBITDAR decreased 9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period. Las Vegas Strip Resorts Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 33.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 35.5% in the prior year period due primarily to the decrease in net revenues, as discussed above.\nRegional Operations\nRegional Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDAR decreased 1% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the prior year quarter. Regional Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 30.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 31.5% in the prior year quarter due primarily to the increase in payroll related expenses and other miscellaneous expenses.\nRegional Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDAR increased 2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the prior year period. Regional Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 31.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 30.9% in the prior year period due primarily to an increase in casino revenues, as discussed above.\nMGM China\nMGM China Segment Adjusted EBITDAR increased 20% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year quarter.

MGM China Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 27.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 27.7% in the prior year period due primarily to a decrease resulting from lower margins in non-gaming operations.\nMGM Digital\nMGM Digital Segment Adjusted EBITDAR loss was $23 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to a loss of $23 million the prior year quarter. \nMGM Digital Segment Adjusted EBITDAR loss was $83 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to a loss of $56 million the prior year period. The change was due primarily to an increase in payroll related costs.\nIncome (loss) from Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe following table summarizes information related to our share of operating income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates:\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n \n(In thousands)\nBetMGM North America Venture\n$\n23,725 \n$\n3,211 \n$\n30,294 \n$\n(67,781)\nOther\n1,917 \n4,778 \n8,312 \n16,462 \n$\n25,642 \n$\n7,989 \n$\n38,606 \n$\n(51,319)\n26\nNon-operating Results\nInterest expense\nGross interest expense was $103 million and $112 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and $317 million and $336 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 is due primarily to a decrease in weighted average outstanding debt. See Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt.\nOther, net\nOther, net was expense of $10 million and income of $93 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily comprised of a net loss related to derivatives of $41 million, partially offset by a foreign currency transaction gain of $23 million primarily related to USD denominated debt held by a foreign subsidiary. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of a net gain related to derivatives of $87 million, a gain related to debt and equity investments of $55 million, interest and dividend income of $18 million, partially offset by foreign currency transaction loss of $65 million.\nOther, net was expense of $183 million and income of $45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily comprised of a foreign currency transaction loss of $285 million, partially offset by interest and dividend income of $37 million, a net gain related to debt and equity investments of $35 million, and a net gain related to derivatives of $34 million. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of a interest and dividend income of $62 million and a gain related to debt and equity investments of $11 million, partially offset by a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million and a net loss related to derivatives of $13 million.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was a benefit of 5.9% on loss before income taxes and a provision of 23.7% on income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to a provision of 17.7% and 9.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate for each of the periods was favorably impacted primarily by the mix of U.S. and foreign incomes including Macau gaming profits which are exempt from complementary tax. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was unfavorably impacted by the non-tax deductible Empire City goodwill impairment recorded during the current quarter. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also favorably impacted by a decrease in the valuation allowance for Macau deferred tax assets.\nReportable Segment GAAP measure\n“Segment Adjusted EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, triple net lease rent expense, income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates, goodwill impairment, and also excludes corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment. Triple net lease rent expense is the expense for rent to landlords under triple net operating leases for its domestic properties, the ground subleases of Beau Rivage and MGM National Harbor, and the land concessions at MGM China. “Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin” is Segment Adjusted EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.\nNon-GAAP measures\n“Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, and goodwill impairment.\n27\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA information is a non-GAAP measure that is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because it is among the measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance, and because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a measure of operating performance in the gaming industry and as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our properties, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. However, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be construed as an alternative or substitute to any measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For example, we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, while we believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to or substitute for operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to or substitute for cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may calculate Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is included herein.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MGM Resorts International to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: \n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n \n(In thousands)\nNet income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International\n$\n(285,255)\n$\n184,578 \n$\n(87,750)\n$\n589,126 \nPlus: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n78,526 \n59,586 \n225,846 \n237,566 \nNet income (loss)\n(206,729)\n244,164 \n138,096 \n826,692 \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n(12,858)\n52,570 \n42,857 \n84,689 \nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(219,587)\n296,734 \n180,953 \n911,381 \nNon-operating (income) expense:\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized\n102,287 \n111,873 \n315,140 \n334,649 \nNon-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates\n(5,942)\n(417)\n(2,149)\n(2,043)\nOther, net\n10,390 \n(93,333)\n182,826 \n(45,096)\n106,735 \n18,123 \n495,817 \n287,510 \nOperating income (loss)\n(112,852)\n314,857 \n676,770 \n1,198,891 \nPreopening and start-up expenses\n31 \n519 \n965 \n2,469 \nProperty transactions, net\n101,775 \n25,493 \n117,368 \n59,124 \nGoodwill impairment\n256,133 \n— \n256,133 \n— \nDepreciation and amortization\n260,717 \n233,330 \n739,136 \n621,868 \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n505,804 \n$\n574,199 \n$\n1,790,372 \n$\n1,882,352 \nGuarantor Financial Information\nAs of September 30, 2025, all of our registered principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our senior credit facility.

In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our senior credit facility or any of our future capital markets indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.\nThe guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes. In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee are limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantor’s obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.\nThe summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below.\n \nSeptember 30,\n2025\nDecember 31,\n2024\nBalance Sheet\n(In thousands)\nCurrent assets\n$\n2,598,614 \n$\n3,045,925 \nIntercompany debt due from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n2,958,377 \n2,733,770 \nOther long-term assets\n28,067,867 \n28,683,234 \nOther current liabilities\n2,053,146 \n2,247,371 \nIntercompany debt due to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n2,199,014 \n2,199,408 \nOther long-term liabilities\n28,530,052 \n28,651,188 \n \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nIncome Statement\n(In thousands) \nNet revenues\n$\n7,872,580 \nOperating income\n10,893 \nIntercompany interest income\n215,218 \nIntercompany interest expense\n(183,457)\nIncome before income taxes\n124,871 \nNet income\n83,975 \nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International\n52,213 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating activities.\n Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and income tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year period. The increase from the prior year period was due primarily to the change in cash paid (refunded) for income taxes and changes in net working capital, partially offset by a decrease in Segment Adjusted EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts discussed within the Results of Operations section above.\nInvesting activities.\n Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our properties. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our \n29\nexisting properties can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.\nCash used in investing activities was $940 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $879 million in the prior year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we made payments of $772 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed $208 million to unconsolidated affiliates, and received $71 million in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. In comparison, in the prior year period we made payments of $747 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed $182 million to unconsolidated affiliates, paid $114 million related to acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and received $224 million in net short-term investments in debt securities.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe made capital expenditures of $772 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, of which $158 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of capital expenditures relating to the gaming concession investment. Capital expenditures primarily related to room remodels, casino floor remodels and equipment, and information technology.\nWe made capital expenditures of $747 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which $98 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of capital expenditures related to the gaming concession investment. Capital expenditures primarily related to information technology and room remodels.\nFinancing activities.\n Cash used in financing activities was $1.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $774 million in the prior year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we had net repayments of debt of $210 million, as further discussed below, paid $717 million for repurchases of our common stock, and distributed $159 million to noncontrolling interest owners. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net borrowings of debt of $581 million, as further discussed below, paid $1.2 billion for repurchases of our common stock, and distributed $104 million to noncontrolling interest owners.\nBorrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we had net repayments of debt of $210 million, which primarily consisted of the repayment of MGM China’s $500 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.25% notes due 2025 upon maturity, partially offset by net borrowings of $290 million on MGM China’s revolving credit facility.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net borrowings of debt of $581 million, which primarily consisted of our issuance of $850 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.125% notes due 2029, our issuance of $750 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.5% notes due 2032, and the issuance of MGM China’s $500 million of aggregate principal amount of 7.125% notes due 2031, partially offset by the repayment of $750 million of aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% notes due 2025, the repayment of MGM China’s $750 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.375% notes due 2024 upon maturity, and net repayments of $19 million on MGM China’s first revolving credit facility.\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the $850 million 6.125% notes due 2029 were used to fund the early redemption of our $675 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% notes due 2025 at a redemption price of 100.607% in October 2024, with the remainder primarily used for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the $750 million 6.5% notes due 2032 were used to fund the early redemption of our $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% notes due 2025 in May 2024. The repayment of MGM China’s $750 million 5.375% notes due 2024 was funded with draws on its first revolving credit facility, which were partially repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of its $500 million 7.125% notes due 2031.\nShare Repurchases and Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we paid $717 million relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. See Note 10 for further information on the stock repurchases. The remaining availability under the November 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $122 million and the remaining availability under the April 2025 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2025. \n30\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid $1.2 billion relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. In connection with those repurchases, the February 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed.\nIn May 2025, upon shareholder approval, MGM China declared the final dividend for 2024 of $122 million, which was paid in June 2025, of which we received approximately $68 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately $54 million.\nIn August 2025, MGM China’s Board of Directors declared an interim dividend of $153 million, which was paid in September 2025, of which we received approximately $85 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately $68 million. \nIn March 2024, MGM China’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend for 2023 of $51 million, which was paid in April 2024, of which we received approximately $29 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately $22 million. A final dividend for 2023 of $118 million was declared in March 2024, approved by the shareholders in May 2024, and paid in June 2024, of which we received approximately $66 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately $52 million.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash\nWe require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic properties daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 billion, of which MGM China held $635 million, and we had $6.2 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $2.8 billion related to MGM China. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility and, as of September 30, 2025, there was $771 million outstanding under MGM China’s revolving credit facility. \nIn October 2025, BetMGM North America Venture announced its expectation to distribute at least $200 million of cash in the fourth quarter of 2025 and to distribute cash on a quarterly basis thereafter, of which we would expect to receive our 50% share.\nOur expected cash interest payments over the next twelve months, \nbased on principal amounts of debt outstanding, contractual maturity da\ntes, and interest rates, each as of September 30, 2025, are approximately $190 million to $210 million, excluding MGM China, and approximately $370 million to $390 million on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China.\nWe are also required, as of September 30, 2025, to make annual cash rent payments of $1.8 billion to our landlords over the next twelve months under triple net lease agreements, which triple net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance (with each lease obligating us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capital expenditures), in addition to the annual cash rent. Refer to Note 1 for discussion of the pending MGM Northfield Park transaction.\nWe have planned capital expen\nditures expected over the remainder of 2025 of approximately $285 million to $335 million on a consolidated basis, of which $50 million to $70 million relates to MGM China and is inclusive of the \nestimated amount of the gaming concession investment that relates to capital projects.\nWe continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as expanding our global online gaming presence, which may require cash commitments in the future. \nAdditionally, we have cash commitments to fund MGM Osaka relating to the development of an integrated resort in Osaka, Japan of JPY428 billion, which represents our\n approximate 43.5% equity share (our estimated ownership percentage of MGM Osaka subsequent to subscribed minority equity interest funding). We expect to fund the estimated \n31\nremaining amount of approximately JPY361 billion (approximately $2.4 billion as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n) over the next three years depending upon project progress. We expect project costs will increase due primarily to inflation, which increases may be offset by cost mitigation efforts and funded by additional financing. Refer to Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our commitments and guarantees. \nIn October 2025, we entered into a JPY45.2 billion term loan A facility with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility up to JPY67.8 billion, as further discussed in Note 5, which we expect to use to support the funding of our cash commitments to MGM Osaka.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nA complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since year end, except as discussed below.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill, and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nAs previously disclosed within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the value of our Empire City reporting unit has been dependent upon us obtaining a commercial gaming license and the timing thereof, as well as other assumptions related to constructing and operating a commercial gaming facility. In the third quarter of 2025, the competitive and economic assumptions underpinning our return expectations on our investment in a commercial gaming facility changed, which led us to determine we would withdraw our application for a commercial gaming license for Empire City. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test of the goodwill related to the Empire City reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. As a result of the decrease in forecasted cash flows, the carrying value of Empire City exceeded its fair value. As such, we recorded an impairment of the full amount of the Empire City reporting unit’s goodwill of $256 million. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nMarket Risk \nThere have been no material changes in our market risk from the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, other than those below. \nInterest rate risk.\n \nWe are subject to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures.\nAs of September 30, 2025, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 12% of our total borrowings. The following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates\n:\n \nDebt maturing in \nFair Value September 30, 2025\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter \nTotal \n \n(In millions except interest rates)\nFixed-rate\n$\n— \n$\n1,150 \n$\n1,425 \n$\n750 \n$\n850 \n$\n1,251 \n$\n5,426 \n$\n5,472 \nAverage interest rate\nN/A\n5.4 \n%\n5.1 \n%\n4.8 \n%\n6.1 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n5.7 \n%\nVariable rate\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n771 \n$\n771 \n$\n771 \nAverage interest rate\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n6.2 \n%\n6.2 \n%\n32\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
