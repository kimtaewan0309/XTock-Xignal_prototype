In 2022, we announced our moonshot goal to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public in the United States in half by 2033.\nAxon is building the public safety operating system of the future by integrating a suite of hardware devices and cloud software solutions that not only revolutionize modern policing but also cater to federal agencies, corrections, justice and enterprise-level security needs. Axon’s suite includes cloud-hosted digital evidence management solutions, productivity and real-time operations software, body cameras, in-car cameras, TASER energy devices, drone and robotic security, and training solutions.\nOur hardware and software solutions advance our mission to (i) make the bullet obsolete, (ii) reduce social conflict, and (iii) enable a fair and effective justice system. Our products solve some of society's most challenging problems and our mission attracts top talent. We aim to invent and deliver public safety products that progressively make the right things easier and the wrong things harder every day.\nOur research & development (“R&D”) investments support continuous innovation on behalf of our customers. Our financial strategy is to build highly recurring, highly profitable businesses and to drive growth through this purposeful product innovation. \nAxon’s operations comprise two reportable segments:\n1.\nSoftware and Sensors: We develop, manufacture and sell fully integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions that enable law enforcement to capture, securely store, manage, share and analyze video and other digital evidence. Our software offerings also support productivity and real-time operations. The Software and Sensors segment includes the sale of sensors, including body cameras, in-car cameras, other hardware sensors, warranties on sensors, and other products, as well as recurring cloud-hosted software revenue, related non-recurring professional services revenue, and revenue from certain software, including on-premise licenses.\n2.\nTASER: Axon is the market leader in the development, manufacture and sale of conducted energy devices (\"CEDs\"), which we sell under our brand name, TASER. The TASER segment includes the manufacture and sale of CEDs, batteries, accessories and extended warranties, digital subscription training content, virtual reality (\"VR\") training content, TASER Evidence.com license revenue, and other professional services tied to TASER and VR deployments.\nFor further information about our reportable segments and sales by geographic region, refer to Note 1 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAxon employees are distributed across multiple geographies and report to work via a remote-hybrid model, which leverages both in-person collaboration environments as well as cloud-based software tools that enable remote productivity. Our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona and our hubs in Seattle, Washington; San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Atlanta, Georgia; and Sterling, Virginia house the majority of our in-person employees located in the United States, including members of our executive management team, and sales, marketing, certain engineering, manufacturing, finance and other administrative support functions. We also have subsidiaries and/or offices located in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Vietnam.\nKey Product Category Revenue Drivers: What We Offer\nAxon products are generally cloud-connected, designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences, and sold via mutually reinforcing integrated subscription plans. Our key revenue drivers belong to three broad product categories:\n•\nSoftware:\n Axon is building a suite of cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions that integrate with our sensors and TASER devices to benefit customers and drive annual recurring revenue, which totaled \n4\nTable of Contents\n$1.0 billion\n1\n as of December 31, 2024. We have many SaaS solutions, which can best be trisected into three categories: digital evidence management, productivity and real-time operations solutions. Axon Evidence is the world’s largest cloud-hosted public safety data repository of public safety video data and other types of digital evidence. Our productivity suite, which includes Axon Records and artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), is designed to save officers time spent writing reports and doing paperwork. Our real-time operations capabilities, which include Axon Respond, integrates location data, signal alerts and video feeds to provide a complete picture of evolving situations.\n•\nSensors:\n Axon devices address many needs, including transparency, real-time situational awareness, and accurate capture and integration of evidence with software workflows. Product categories within sensors include Axon Body cameras, Axon Fleet in-car systems, drones and robotics, and other devices that work with our software. Our software solutions also support an open ecosystem of connected devices produced by other vendors.\n•\nTASER:\n We develop smart devices, tools and services that support public safety officers in de-escalating situations, avoiding or minimizing use of force and aiding consumer personal protection. These tools include TASER devices, VR training services and consumer devices. Research has shown that TASER devices are the most effective less-than-lethal force option, with the lowest likelihood of injury to officers and assailants. Since our inception in 1993, TASER devices have been adopted by a majority of U.S. state and local law enforcement and are used daily to help keep communities safe. Global adoption of TASER devices remains early and we are expanding into new geographies. Axon VR solutions make public safety training more accessible, relevant and affordable — with the goal of using new immersive VR technologies to better prepare officers for real-life situations in the field.\nSales and Distribution: Who We Sell To and Where We Deliver\nWe think of our core customers as falling into roughly four categories of funding sources: U.S. state and local governments, the U.S. federal government, international government customers and commercial enterprises. Additionally, the types of customers who find value in our product offerings are expanding beyond law enforcement to include customers such as attorneys, corrections, fire and emergency medical services personnel, commercial enterprise security, frontline enterprise workers, and the U.S. military.\nAxon’s sales force and strong customer relationships represent key strategic advantages. The majority of our revenues are generated via direct sales, including our online store, although we do leverage distribution partners and third-party resellers. \nNo customer represented more than 10% of total net sales\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. As we diversify into new markets, we have been investing in sales personnel and strategic headcount additions to support growth in these markets.\nGovernmental agencies generally have the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, for reasons including non-appropriation of funds. We continue to monitor developments in federal government funding.\nResources \nManufacturing and Supply Chain\nWe perform light manufacturing, final assembly and final test operations at our facilities in Scottsdale, Arizona and own substantially all of the equipment required to develop, prototype, manufacture and assemble our finished products. We have continued to maintain both our ISO 9001 and our ISO 9001:2015 certifications.\nWe continue to take steps to diversify our supply chain and global manufacturing footprint, which positions us well to manage supply chain disruptions. Material availability has mostly stabilized from prior supply chain challenges while general levels of risk continue to exist in all businesses that manufacture products. Supplier decommitments remain a top \n1\n \nCalculated as monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. Annual recurring revenue is a forward-looking performance indicator that management believes provides more visibility into the growth of our revenue generated by our highest margin, recurring services. Annual recurring revenue should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue because it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace GAAP revenue or deferred revenue, as they can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Annual recurring revenue is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue or deferred revenue.\n5\nTable of Contents\narea of risk. However, we have put programs in place to mitigate this risk. We proactively manage our supply chain down to third tier suppliers to mitigate and overcome material shortages. These actions align to our strategic model to help meet strong product demand while also preparing us to stagger factory work schedules as needed, which enables us to meet compressed build schedules over short periods of time. We continue to adjust strategic inventory levels in both raw materials and finished goods based on areas of risk to mitigate potential supply disruptions.\nIn light of our broad domestic and international supplier base, we are continuously monitoring our supply chain to manage through potential impacts, identifying alternate shipping and logistic sources, and working with foreign regulators to ensure that our suppliers can provide high quality parts. Despite past supply chain disruptions relating to material shortages and port constraints, we remain focused on actively managing our supply chain by strengthening strategic relationships, securing secondary and alternate sourcing, adjusting build plans, maintaining strategic inventory and utilizing flexible logistics to support growing demand while minimizing customer disruptions. \nEven as we continue to expand our second sourcing of materials across our supply chain, we still obtain some unique components from single source suppliers. However, because we own substantially all of the injection molded component tooling used in their production, we believe we could obtain alternative suppliers in most cases with varying levels of interruption. In addition, we also have programs to hold additional raw materials (such as resins, battery components and critical semiconductors) to mitigate supply interruptions and better manage costs. For additional discussion of sources and availability of raw materials, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe offer both limited and extended manufacturer’s warranties on our Axon devices and CEDs. For additional information about our warranties, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe protect our intellectual property with U.S. and foreign patents, U.S. and foreign trademark registrations, and U.S. copyright registrations. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and laws to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2024, we hold over\n 330 U.S. patents, over 150 U.S. registered trademarks, over 270 international patents and over 460 international registered trademarks, a\ns well as numerous pending patent and trademark applications. \nWe continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance to our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions, our strategic technology or product directions in different countries, and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. We have the exclusive rights to many Internet domain names, primarily including “Axon.com,” “Evidence.com” and “TASER.com.” We also vigorously protect our intellectual property, including our patents and trademarks against third-party infringement.\nWe also execute non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants and key suppliers to help ensure the confidentiality of our trade secrets.\nCompetition\nSensors — Connected Cameras and Digital Evidence Management Software:\n The body camera and in-car video/automatic license plate readers industry is highly competitive.

Key competitive factors in this product category include variety and weight limits of compatible payloads, battery life and associated flight range, maneuverability and size, autonomy and onboard intelligence (including ability to navigate in GPS denied environments), sensor and imaging technology, durability and robustness of the drone, cost and maintenance required, reliability and security of communication and control systems, the simplicity of the drone piloting user interface and the training required to operate the drones. \nDedrone by Axon:\n \nThe counter drone space is fast growing and very fragmented. Within it, Dedrone competes with Advanced Protection Systems, Anduril, ApolloShield, ARTSys360, Aselsan, Belgian Advanced Technology Systems, Big Bang Boom Solutions, Bligther Surveillance Systems, BlueHalo, BSS Holland, CACI, Cerbair, Chess Dynamics, DEFSYS, Department 13, D-Fend, DroneDefence, Droneshield, Dynamite Global Strategies, DZYNE Technologies, EDGE, EdgeSource, Elbit Systems, ELT Group, ESG, Fortem Technologies, FN Herstal, General Atomics, Gradiant, Guardion, Havelsan, Hensoldt, Hertz New Technologies, IEC Infrared Systems, Indra, L3 Harris, Leidos, Leonardo DRS, LiveLink Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Marduk, MBDA, MC2 Technologies, Meteksan Savunma, Metis, MSI Defense Systems, MyDefence, Northrop Grumman, NSO Group, Openworks, QinetiQ, Raytheon, Regulus, Rheinmetall, SAAB, SAIC, SAMI Advanced Electronics, Securiton, Sensofusion, Sentrycs, Sentry View Systems, Skycope, Skylock, Skysafe, \n7\nTable of Contents\nSNC, Sopra Steria, SRC, Teledyne FLIR, Terma, Thales, TRD Systems, UAVOS, Unifly, Vector Solutions, Vigilant Drone Defense, Vorpal, Whitefox Defense, and Zen Technologies, among others.\nKey competitive factors in this product category include the breadth and accuracy of detection sensors (e.g., pan-tilt-zoom cameras, radar, and acoustic) and multi-sensor fusion approaches, the chosen methodology for radio frequency-based detection (e.g., RF signature matching or RF demodulation), integration of detection platforms with robust mitigation solutions (e.g., jammers, cyber-takeover, kinetic and high-energy), the capacity to improve detection through scale and continuous exposure to diverse drone makes and models in areas of high drone activity (e.g., urban centers, active war zones) and the seamless interoperability with existing security and defense ecosystems\nTASER for Professional Users:\n Our CEDs compete with a variety of less-than-lethal alternatives to firearms, including rubber bullets or rubber baton rounds, such as those made by Combined Systems, Inc.; pepper spray and pepper spray projectiles, such as those made by Byrna Technologies Inc. (dba Fox Labs), SABRE Corporation and Mace Security International, Inc.; traditional stun guns, such as those made by UZI and Jolt; hand-held remote restraint devices involving a tether, such as those made by Wrap Technologies Inc.; laser dazzlers that cause temporary blindness, such as those made by B.E. Meyers & Co., Inc.; stun grenades, such as those made by Combined Systems, Inc.; long-range acoustic devices, such as those made by Genasys Inc.; and police batons and night sticks, such as those made by Monadnock and Armament Systems and Procedures, Inc. TASER devices offer advanced technology, versatility, portability, effectiveness, built-in accountability systems and low injury rates, which enable us to compete effectively against other less-than-lethal alternatives. TASER devices also offer connectivity to our cloud network, which allows law enforcement agencies and other professional users to more effectively manage their less-than-lethal programs and automate use-of-force reporting.\nThe key competitive factors in this product category include a device’s accuracy, effectiveness, reputation, safety, cost, ease of use, and exceptional customer experience. The design maturity of the TASER platform, as well as our development and sale of a multi-shot device, are also key competitive differentiators. We are aware of competitors providing competing CED products primarily outside of the United States.\nTASER for Personal Safety:\n In the private citizen space, TASER devices compete with firearms and other less-than-lethal self-defense options such as stun guns and pepper spray-based products. Leading competitors in the less-than-lethal space include Byrna Technologies, Inc., Mace, PepperBall, SABRE, Salt Supply Co. and Vipertek. The TASER StrikeLight competes in the flashlight category, in which there are dozens, if not hundreds, of competitors, including tactical flashlight providers with and without stun gun capabilities.\nTASER Bolt and TASER Pulse are not stun guns, and have different capabilities, including neuromuscular incapacitation functionality. The broader market for personal safety and home defense is far-reaching, and categories range from threat detection and accountability (e.g., dash and doorbell cameras), to home security (e.g., home alarms, locks and response services) to personal defense (e.g., firearms, stun guns, TASER devices, pepper spray, tactical flashlights and personal alarms), to personal tracking and emergency notification mobile applications.\nThe primary benefit of TASER devices is in less-than-lethal incapacitation. Other competitive factors include a device’s cost, effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and available training options.\nNon-Axon trademarks are property of their respective owners.\nSeasonality\nOur business operations are influenced by municipal budget cycles. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact the cadence of net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Municipal law enforcement budgets tend to feature a mix of fiscal years that end in either June, September or December, while U.S. federal budget year end is in September. However, historical seasonal patterns, municipal budgets or historical patterns of product introductions should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net sales or financial performance.\nGovernmental Regulation \nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations related to: privacy and data protection, security, retention and deletion; rights of publicity; content; intellectual property; regulation of certain of our CEDs as firearms; advertising; marketing; distribution; electronic contracts and other communications; competition; consumer protection; telecommunications; product liability; taxation; labor and employment; sustainability; economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions; securities; and online \n8\nTable of Contents\npayment services. A number of federal and state legislative proposals in the United States could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. Foreign laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legal and Compliance Risks” for additional details.\nRadio Spectrum and Unmanned Aerial and Ground-Based Robotic Devices\nCertain of our products utilize radio spectrum to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. The allocation of spectrum is regulated in the United States and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. If current products do not comply with the regulations set forth by these regulatory bodies, we may be unable to sell our products or could incur penalties. Our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, the European Union Directorate-General for Environment or regulatory bodies in other countries. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed. \nAxon body cameras, docks, Axon Fleet vehicle cameras and Axon Signal devices are subject to the FCC’s rules and regulations in the United States, as well as rules and regulations as applicable outside of the United States. These regulations affect our CEDs with Axon Signal technology, including the TASER 7 CED, Signal Performance Power Magazine (“SPPM”), the TASER 10 CED, and future CEDs implementing wireless technology. Compliance with government regulations could increase our operations and product costs and impact our future financial results. \nAdditionally, some of our products depend on drones or other unmanned aerial and ground-based systems that operate on the radio spectrum. We have also recently started offering hardware sensors combined with software to detect, identify, track and mitigate drones through our acquisition of Dedrone. The FCC, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies at the federal, state and local levels (as well as in foreign jurisdictions) are beginning to address some of the numerous certification, regulatory and legal challenges associated with drones, but a comprehensive set of standards and enforcement procedures has yet to be developed. Changes to the regulation of drones or other unmanned aerial systems may impact our future financial results.\nAxon and TASER CEDs\nFor our CED products, we rely on the opinions of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”), including the determination that a device that does not expel projectiles by the action of an explosive is not classified as a firearm. Changes in laws, regulations, and interpretations outside of our control may result in our products being classified or reclassified as firearms. If this were to occur, our private citizen demand could be substantially reduced because consumers would be required to comply with federal, state or local firearm transfer requirements prior to purchasing our product. For additional details, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legal and Compliance Risks.”\nFederal regulation of sales in the United States:\n \nThe majority of our currently offered CEDs are not classified as firearms regulated by the ATF. However, the ATF regulates the TASER 10 CED as a firearm under the Gun Control Act of 1968 due to a technological advancement specific to the propulsion design of the TASER 10 CED cartridges. In the event we make the TASER 10 CED available to our private citizen and enterprise customers, demand could be substantially reduced as a result of this classification because non-governmental end-users would be required to comply with federal, state or local firearm transfer requirements prior to purchasing the TASER 10 CED. In addition, the implications of such classification on use-of-force standards and regulations could impact our ability to sell the TASER 10 CED to law enforcement and government entities. Because Axon must maintain a federal firearms license to manufacture and sell the TASER 10 CED, we are subject to periodic compliance inspections by the ATF. License violations discovered by the ATF can result in fines, penalties, warning letters or license revocation, leading to disruptions in operations. Further, we are required to administer, track and remit firearm and ammunition excise taxes as applicable.\nOur CED products are also subject to testing, safety and other standards by organizations such as the American National Standards Institute, the International Electrotechnical Commission, the National Institute of Standards and \n9\nTable of Contents\nTechnology and Underwriters Laboratories. These regulations also affect CEDs with Axon Signal technology, including SPPM technology, and the TASER 7 and TASER 10 battery packs.\nFederal regulation of international sales:\n \nOur CEDs are considered a “crime control” product by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) for export directly from the United States, which requires us to obtain an export license from the DOC for the export of our CED devices from the United States to any country other than Canada. Future products and services may require classifications from the DOC before they may be shipped internationally. Our inability to obtain DOC export licenses or classifications on a timely basis for sales of our products and services to our international customers could significantly and adversely affect our international sales. Although the TASER 10 CED is regulated by the ATF for domestic sales, the DOC has ruled that the product’s unique propulsion design has no impact on its export classification and the export classification of the TASER 10 CED remains consistent with all other TASER CED models.\nFederal regulation of foreign national employees:\n \nOur CED development and production is also considered controlled “technology” by the DOC and is categorized as a “deemed export” for any foreign national employees exposed to the technology within the United States. Consequently, we must obtain export licenses from the DOC for any deemed export within the United States made to a foreign national employee exposed to the controlled technology. Deemed export licenses are subject to DOC approvals and issued licenses require annual status reports for the stated employees. Inability to obtain proper licensing could curtail our ability to execute R&D and production related to CED technology.\nState and local regulation:\n \nOur CEDs are controlled, restricted or, less frequently, prohibited by some state and local governments. Other jurisdictions may ban or restrict the sale of our TASER-branded devices, or restrict their use through changes to use-of-force laws or regulations, and our product sales may be significantly affected by additional state, county and city governmental regulation. The change in the TASER 10 CED's propulsion design may impact how the TASER 10 CED is regulated at the state and/or local level depending on each state’s firearm laws.\nInternational regulation of foreign imports and sales:\n Certain jurisdictions prohibit, restrict or require a permit for the importation, sale, possession or use of our CEDs (and other select Axon products), including in some countries by law enforcement agencies, impacting our international sales opportunities.\nU.S. and international regulation of component movements globally:\n \nWe rely on a global supply chain of components across our product lines with most final assembly occurring in the United States. Export of these components is subject to shifting regulatory landscapes imposed by both foreign and U.S. authorities. Abrupt changes to these regulations can result in delays or interruptions to final product supplies. Additionally, ATF regulation of certain imports of the TASER 10 CED components may impact our supply chain agility.\nInternational regulation of foreign-based operations:\n We maintain foreign operations in several countries globally for purposes of logistics, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) services, and R&D support. Depending on these activities, applicable regulations may include business activity licensing and registration, import permits and recordkeeping, warehousing and storage security and permitting, and government reporting. Any failure to comply with these requirements could impact our ability to sell, support or develop our products and services both internationally and in the United States.\nWe offer products and services that some jurisdictions determine to be “prohibited” or “controlled” weapons under applicable local arms brokering regulations. Consequently, jurisdictions with such regulations, particularly those that are signatories to the Arms Trade Treaty, can require certain covered groups and our employees to receive weapons brokering licenses. Brokering license issuance and approval is not always guaranteed and is subject to the applicable policy of the approving jurisdiction. Denial or limitations on brokering activity can impact the ability of individual employees to proceed with weapons brokering activity in certain instances.\nFederal Procurement Regulations\nOur U.S. government business is subject to specific procurement regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and a variety of socioeconomic and other requirements imposed by executive order and statute. These requirements, although customary in U.S. government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the U.S. government will likely continue to implement new requirements focused on initiatives to drive efficiencies, affordability and cost savings and other changes to its procurement practices to meet governmental interests. These initiatives and changes to procurement practices may \n10\nTable of Contents\nchange the way U.S. government contracts are solicited, negotiated and managed, which may affect whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the U.S. government, including the terms and conditions under which we do so, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations and requirements could lead to contractual, civil, criminal, and administrative remedies such as termination, fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or indefinitely. Among the causes for suspension or debarment are violations of various laws and regulations, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. government contract or relationship as a result of any of these violations would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. government contracts.\nPrivacy Regulations\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations associated with the collection, processing, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information and other sensitive and confidential information. This data is wide ranging and relates to our employees, customers and other third parties, including the subjects of law enforcement. Our compliance obligations include those prescribed under laws and regulations that dictate whether, how and under what circumstances we can receive, control, process, hold and/or transfer certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If one or more of the legal mechanisms for transferring data from other countries to the United States is invalidated, if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our products and services or adversely affect our financial results. Countries may also pass legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services and expose us to significant penalties for non-compliance. For example, the European Parliament adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, effective May 2018, that extended the scope of European privacy laws to any entity that controls or processes personal data of European Union residents in connection with the offer of goods or services or the monitoring of behavior and imposes compliance obligations concerning the handling of personal data. Further, Vietnam's Personal Data Protection Decree, which entered into force July 1, 2023, applies to organizations (wherever based) so long as they participate in personal data processing in Vietnam. We are also subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the California Privacy Rights Act, which provides enhanced consumer protections for California residents, a private right of action for data breaches and statutory ﬁnes and damages for data breaches or other California Consumer Privacy Act violations, as well as a requirement of “reasonable” cybersecurity, which could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims, class actions and commercial liabilities.\nAny inability, or perceived inability, by us to adequately address privacy concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards and guidance, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, could result in signiﬁcant regulatory and third-party liability, increased costs, disruption of our business and operations, and a loss of conﬁdence and other reputational damage. Furthermore, as new privacy laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations continues to increase and become a signiﬁcant compliance workstream.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe\n are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in our products and making us financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of such products. The European Union has published Directives on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in electronic and electrical equipment (the “RoHS Directive”) and on electronic and electrical waste management (the “WEEE Directive”). The RoHS Directive restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead. The WEEE Directive directs members of the European Union to enact laws, regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the European Union. In addition, similar environmental legislation has been enacted in other jurisdictions, including the United States (under federal and state laws) and other \ncountries.\nIn\n addition, the European Union has defined a regulation for the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals that places responsibility on companies to manage the risks from chemicals contained in products and to \n11\nTable of Contents\nprovide safety information about such substances. Manufacturers and importers are required to gather information on the properties of the chemical substances in their products and provide for their safe handling. As of January 5, 2021, companies supplying products in the European Union containing substances of very high concern as identified by the European Union have to submit information on these products to the European Chemicals Agency. The information in their database is then made available to waste operators and consumers.\nOther\n countries have adopted chemical restrictions regulations, including the United States, Canada and Australia. For example, U.S. governmental authorities are increasingly focused on preventing environmental contamination from per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), which may be contained in certain Axon products. Federal and state governments and agencies are in various stages of considering and/or implementing laws and regulations requiring the reporting, restriction and/or phase-out of PFAS in products. \nIn\n addition, further environmental or climate change disclosure legislation may be enacted in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States (under federal and state laws) and other countries, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. For example, the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the United Kingdom’s Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting introduce additional due diligence and disclosure requirements addressing sustainability that apply or we expect will apply, as applicable, to us over the coming years. Further, in September 2023, California passed the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, requiring increased climate-related reporting. While currently stayed, the SEC’s recently adopted climate-related reporting requirements, to the extent they become effective, will also require extensive additional disclosure regarding sustainability.\nThese\n requirements will, and changes in environmental or climate change disclosure laws, regulations or rules could, lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues and changes to our operations. Such changes could include those related to our manufacturing practices and/or product designs, which may be significant and could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Any failures to comply could result in governmental action, including the imposition of fines, or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur success depends on the continued service of our employees and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate top talent. To achieve this, we strive to foster a diverse and inclusive environment at Axon, offering equitable opportunities for growth and development, supported by strong compensation and benefits and by programs that build c\nonnections between our employees and their communities. Axon’s mission is central to our recruiting and retention efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had more than 4,100 full-time employees and more than 870 temporary employees (which include contractors, interns and individual consultants). During 2024, the number of our full-time employees increased by approximately 770 or 23%, primarily in our R&D, operations and sales organizations. Employee growth was further driven by our acquisitions that were completed in the year.\nWe are committed to providing a comprehensive and competitive total rewards package to attract, motivate, and retain top talent. We review our programs annually to ensure they align with market practices in the industries and countries where we operate. Our global benefits include broad-based stock grants and performance-based bonuses, comprehensive healthcare and retirement benefits, paid parental and family leave, commuter benefits, unlimited paid time off for U.S. exempt employees, and flexible leave options for non-exempt and international employees. Additionally, we provide free access to virtual coaching and therapy through Modern Health, as well as support programs for employees navigating significant life events.\nWe prioritize career advancement and internal mobility by encouraging employees to explore traditional career paths or pursue cross-functional opportunities that often result in promotions. Employees are supported through structured mentorship and rotational programs, as well as access to self-directed virtual training platforms, role-specific on-the-job learning opportunities, and leadership and technical skill-building workshops. Our focus on development, combined with competitive benefits, enabled us to close \nthe year with a regrettable attrition rate\n2\n of less than 1%, well below our annual goal of 1.5%. Employees reported a higher than 89% satisfaction score for feeling proud to work at Axon during our 2024 employee engagement survey and an 86% satisfaction score on recommending Axon as a great place to work.\n2\n \nRegrettable attrition is defined as rolling 12-month attrition of employees rated as top performing in the prior performance rating cycle.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe are committed to maintaining a workplace where all employees feel respected and valued. We hire, evaluate, and promote employees based on merit, skills, and performance, with zero tolerance for harassment, retaliation, violence, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability, or veteran status. To reinforce this commitment, all employees complete anti-harassment training during onboarding and repeat it annually. Leadership training is provided throughout the year to ensure managers are equipped to address and resolve employee concerns effectively.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. We conduct regular self-assessments and audits to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective gear (e.g., eye protection, masks and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties. \nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Arizona in September 1993 as ICER Corporation.

  "item7": "Item 7.    \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors” and “Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The various sections of our MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing. The tables in the MD&A sections below are derived from exact numbers and may have immaterial rounding differences.\nOur MD&A discusses our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.\nOverview\nAxon is building the public safety operating system of the future by integrating a suite of hardware devices and cloud software solutions that not only revolutionize modern policing but also cater to federal agencies, corrections, justice and enterprise-level security and safety needs. Axon’s suite includes cloud-hosted digital evidence management solutions, productivity and real-time operations software, body cameras, in-car cameras, TASER energy devices, robotic security and training solutions. Axon’s growing global customer base includes first responders across international, federal, state, and local law enforcement, fire, corrections, and emergency medical services, as well as the justice sector, commercial enterprises, and consumers.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $2.1 billion, an increase of $521.8 million, or 33.4%, from the comparable period in the prior year. We had income from operations of $58.5 million, compared to $156.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Gross margin dollars increased $285.9 million but decreased as a percentage of revenue to 59.6% from 61.2% compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and intangibles amortization in costs of goods sold, adjusted gross margin increased to 63.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 61.8% for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increased mix of high-margin Axon Cloud & Services revenue and investments in TASER automation and cost-reduction initiatives. Operating expenses increased $384.2 million, reflecting an increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expenses, as well as an increase in professional and consulting expenses related to transaction costs. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded net income of $377.0 million which included net realized and unrealized gains on fair value adjustments of strategic investments of $162.9 million, a net unrealized gain on marketable securities of $120.3 million, and interest income, net of $36.6 million. Net income of $175.8 million for the comparable period in the prior year reflected net unrealized losses of $80.5 million related to impairment and observable price changes for our existing investments and related warrants, interest income, net of $42.1 million, and a net unrealized gain of $38.7 million on marketable securities. \nCertain prior period amounts previously reported on our consolidated financial statements have been revised to correct for immaterial errors, as described in Note 1, Note 23 and Note 24 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, in Q1 2025 we approved a plan to realign our business to better reflect our continued growth and expansion of product, software and service offerings. Previously reported within two reportable segments, TASER and Software and Sensors, we will prospectively reorganize our business in a manner that provides increased transparency and distinction between our hardware and software and services components. As a result of the reorganization, effective with the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, our financial results will be reported in two reportable segments, Connected Devices and Software & Services, which our CODM will use to regularly review information, allocate resources and assess performance. Connected Devices will include hardware products, such as CEDs, body cameras, and drones. Software & Services will include products that integrate with our suite of connected devices, such as Axon Evidence, RMS and other cloud services. \n43\nTable of Contents\nWe are currently assessing the impact of this change on our financial reporting and related segment disclosures. We intend to recast prior period segment information to conform to the new reporting structure, as necessary, to ensure consistency and comparability across reporting periods.\nResults of Operations \nThe following table presents data from our consolidated statements of operations as well as the percentage relationship to total net sales of items included in our statements of operations (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,  \n2024\n2023\nNet sales from products\n$\n1,221,292 \n58.6 \n%\n$\n964,002 \n61.8 \n%\nNet sales from services\n861,234 \n41.4 \n596,697 \n38.2 \nNet sales\n2,082,526 \n100.0 \n1,560,699 \n100.0 \nCost of product sales\n618,136 \n29.7 \n447,708 \n28.7 \nCost of service sales\n223,010 \n10.7 \n157,538 \n10.1 \nCost of sales\n841,146 \n40.4 \n605,246 \n38.8 \nGross margin\n1,241,380 \n59.6 \n955,453 \n61.2 \nSelling, general and administrative\n741,247 \n35.6 \n494,884 \n31.7 \nResearch and development\n441,593 \n21.2 \n303,719 \n19.5 \nTotal operating expenses\n1,182,840 \n56.8 \n798,603 \n51.2 \nIncome from operations\n58,540 \n2.8 \n156,850 \n10.0 \nInterest income, net\n36,595 \n1.8 \n42,112 \n2.7 \nOther income (loss), net\n286,369 \n13.8 \n(41,901)\n(2.7)\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n381,504 \n18.3 \n157,061 \n10.1 \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n4,470 \n0.2 \n(18,722)\n(1.2)\nNet income\n$\n377,034 \n18.1 \n%\n$\n175,783 \n11.3 \n%\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by geography (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\nUnited States\n$\n1,775,194\n85 \n%\n$\n1,335,516\n86 \n%\nOther countries\n307,332\n15 \n225,183\n14 \nTotal\n$\n2,082,526\n100 \n%\n$\n1,560,699\n100 \n%\nInternational revenue increased as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increased sales in our Americas region (i.e., Central America, South America, and Canada).\n44\nTable of Contents\nNet Sales\nNet sales by product line were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, \n \nDollar\nChange\nPercent \nChange \n2024\n2023\nTASER segment:\nTASER Devices (Professional)\n$\n453,055 \n21.8 \n%\n$\n333,923 \n21.4 \n%\n$\n119,132 \n35.7 \n%\nCartridges\n246,766 \n11.8 \n193,285 \n12.4 \n53,481 \n27.7 \nAxon Evidence and Cloud Services\n54,913 \n2.6 \n35,680 \n2.3 \n19,233 \n53.9 \nExtended Warranties\n37,515 \n1.8 \n31,689 \n2.0 \n5,826 \n18.4 \nOther \n(1)\n26,424 \n1.3 \n18,933 \n1.2 \n7,491 \n39.6 \nTASER segment\n818,673 \n39.3 \n613,510 \n39.3 \n205,163 \n33.4 \nSoftware and Sensors segment:\n \n \n \nAxon Evidence and Cloud Services\n808,256 \n38.8 \n566,003 \n36.3 \n242,253 \n42.8 \nAxon Body Cameras and Accessories\n246,855 \n11.9 \n183,023 \n11.7 \n63,832 \n34.9 \nAxon Fleet Systems\n104,890 \n5.0 \n121,842 \n7.8 \n(16,952)\n(13.9)\nExtended Warranties\n66,141 \n3.2 \n55,154 \n3.5 \n10,987 \n19.9 \nOther \n(2)\n37,711 \n1.8 \n21,167 \n1.4 \n16,544 \n78.2 \nSoftware and Sensors segment\n1,263,853 \n60.7 \n947,189 \n60.7 \n316,664 \n33.4 \nTotal net sales\n$\n2,082,526 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n1,560,699 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n521,827 \n33.4 \n%\n(1)\nTASER segment “Other” includes smaller categories, such as VR hardware, weapons training revenue such as revenue associated with our Master Instructor School, and TASER consumer device sales.\n(2)\nSoftware and Sensors segment “Other” includes revenue from items including Signal Sidearm, Interview Room, Axon Air, partners' contra-revenue and other sensors and equipment.\nNet sales for the TASER segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $205.2 million, or 33.4%, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $119.1 million in TASER devices and an increase of $53.5 million in cartridge revenue. The increase is primarily related to continued adoption of our newest device, TASER 10. The increase in revenue from Axon Evidence and cloud services of $19.2 million was driven by an increase in the number of cloud-connected TASER devices in the field and software revenue tied to our VR solution. An increase in TASER devices in the field drove the $5.8 million increase in extended warranties, as most of those devices are sold with extended warranties. The $7.5 million increase in \"Other\" revenue is primarily driven by increased VR hardware volume.\nNet sales for the Software and Sensors segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $316.7 million, or 33.4%, as compared to the prior year, as we continued to add users and associated devices to our network. The increase in the aggregate number of users and growing adoption of our premium add-on features by existing customers drove the majority of the increase in Axon Evidence and cloud services revenue of $242.3 million. Axon Body cameras and accessories revenue increased $63.8 million due to higher unit sales. Partially offsetting the increase was a $17.0 million decrease in Axon Fleet systems revenue reflecting lower unit volumes on more normalized deployment timelines. An increase in cameras and docks in the field drove the $11.0 million increase in extended warranties, as most of those devices are sold with extended warranties. The $16.5 million increase in “Other” revenue was primarily driven by demand for other product offerings within the Software and Sensors segment.\nGross Margin\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross margin for the TASER segment decreased to 58.6% from 60.6% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and \n2023, \nrespectively. The decrease was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense, adjusted gross margin for the TASER segment is \n45\nTable of Contents\n62.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 60.9% for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to investments in automation and cost reduction initiatives. \nAs a percentage of net sales, gross margin for the Software and Sensors segment decreased to 60.2% from 61.6% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Within the Software and Sensors segment, hardware gross margin was 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 45.8% for the same period in 2023. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets, hardware adjusted gross margin decreased to 41.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 46.2% for the same period in 2023 primarily due to product mix and inventory reserve charges associated with legacy products. Service gross margin increased to 73.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 72.6% for the same period in 2023. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and intangibles amortization, service adjusted gross margin increased to 75.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 73.6% for the same period in 2023, due to higher software revenue mix.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we have seen an increase in stock-based compensation expense within our cost of goods sold as a result of RSUs granted in January 2024 that generally vest in five annual installments from March 2024 through March 2028. These RSUs were granted to employees whose compensation was under a specified threshold, including production-line employees. As previously disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Patrick W. Smith, our Chief Executive Officer, agreed to compensation in a lesser amount than the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors was otherwise willing to provide so that we could instead provide enhanced compensation opportunities to certain of our other employees.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n2024\n2023\nSalaries, benefits and bonus\n$\n251,139 \n$\n215,100 \n$\n36,039 \n16.8 \n%\nSales and marketing\n108,954 \n91,868 \n17,086 \n18.6 \nStock-based compensation\n190,561 \n58,533 \n132,028 \n225.6 \nOther\n190,593 \n129,383 \n61,210 \n47.3 \nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n741,247 \n$\n494,884 \n$\n246,363 \n49.8 \n%\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales\n35.6 \n%\n31.7 \n%\nSalaries, benefits and bonus expense increased $36.0 million in comparison to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount and higher wages.\nSales and marketing expense increased $17.1 million in comparison to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to increased commissions of $12.4 million and an increase of $4.7 million related to in-person events.\nStock-based compensation expense increased $132.0 million in comparison to the prior year, which was primarily related to the 2024 Employee XSP and the 2024 CEO Performance Award that were approved by shareholders in the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and increased headcount.\nOther SG&A expenses increased $61.2 million in comparison to the prior year, primarily driven by the following:\n•\nProfessional and consulting expenses increased $21.5 million, primarily driven by transaction costs related to business acquisitions and strategic investments for Fusus and Dedrone;\n•\nTravel expenses increased $9.5 million, as a result of increased in-person meetings and lodging costs;\n•\nOffice and building expenses increased $7.1 million relating to building rent and property taxes;\n•\nSupplies expenses increased $6.7 million primarily due to an increase in computer licenses.\n46\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n2024\n2023\nSalaries, benefits and bonus\n$\n233,247\n$\n178,658\n$\n54,589 \n30.6 \n%\nStock-based compensation\n131,954\n66,230\n65,724 \n99.2 \nOther\n76,392\n58,831\n17,561 \n29.8 \nTotal research and development expenses\n$\n441,593\n$\n303,719\n$\n137,874 \n45.4 \n%\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales\n21.2 \n%\n19.5 \n%\nSalaries, benefits, and bonus expense increased $54.6 million in comparison to the prior-year comparable period, which was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount and higher wages.\nStock-based compensation expense increased $65.7 million which was primarily related to the 2024 Employee XSP that was approved by shareholders in the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and increased headcount.\nOther R&D expenses increased $17.6 million, primarily related to increased professional and consulting expenses related to the launch of new products of $6.6 million, and increased internal cloud storage and service costs related to software product development of $3.9 million.\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income, net, was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nInterest income\n$\n43,693 \n$\n49,107 \nInterest expense\n(7,098)\n(6,995)\nTotal interest income, net\n$\n36,595 \n$\n42,112 \nThe decrease in interest income for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n is primarily related to lowe\nr balances of available-for-sale securities during the year.

The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by higher pre-tax income, which reduced the relative impact of favorable tax adjustments. The increase in current year rate is primarily driven by a lesser percentage of allowable stock based compensation adjustment in comparison to pre-tax book income. Additionally, the R&D credit was a lesser percentage of pretax income which was offset by the reversal of nontaxable gain on investments.\nProvision for income taxes were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nPre-tax income\n$\n381,504\n$\n157,061\n$\n224,443\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n4,470\n(18,722)\n23,192\nEffective tax rate\n1.2 \n%\n(11.9)\n%\n13.1 \n%\nNet Income\nWe recorded net income of $377.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a net income of $175.8 million in 2023.

Beginning with our first fiscal quarter of 2024, we have added adjusted gross margin to our non-GAAP financial measures. We have adjusted for expenses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. To improve comparability, prior periods have been conformed to the current period presentation. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our operating performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented below. \n•\nEBITDA (most comparable GAAP measure: Net income) – Earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA (most comparable GAAP measure: Net income) – Earnings before interest expense; investment interest income; income taxes; depreciation; amortization; noncash stock-based compensation expense; fair value adjustments related to strategic investments and marketable securities; transaction and integration costs related to strategic investments and acquisitions including adjustments related to the foreign currency impact of acquired intercompany balances that were unsettled as of the reporting date and plan to be settled in the near term; inventory step-up amortization related to acquisitions; certain litigation costs and recoveries related to (1) antitrust cases we consider to be non-recurring and outside of our core operating results and (2) litigation matters for acquired companies that were unresolved at the date of the acquisition; and other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance (listed in the tables below).\n•\nAdjusted gross margin (most comparable GAAP measure: Gross margin) – Gross margin before noncash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and inventory step-up amortization related to acquisitions.\n48\nTable of Contents\nAlthough these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, we believe investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing our operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\n•\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to our GAAP financial measures;\n•\nthese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our GAAP financial measures;\n•\nthese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to our GAAP financial measures; and\n•\nthese non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with GAAP and investors should not assume that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principles.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconcile to net income as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\n377,034 \n$\n175,783 \nDepreciation and amortization\n56,815 \n32,638 \nInterest expense\n7,098 \n6,995 \nInvestment interest income\n(43,693)\n(49,107)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n4,470 \n(18,722)\nEBITDA\n$\n401,724 \n$\n147,587 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nStock-based compensation expense\n382,604 \n131,358 \nUnrealized (gain) loss on strategic investments and marketable securities, net\n(192,067)\n41,785 \nRealized gain on previously held minority interest, net\n(91,150)\n— \nTransaction and integration costs related to strategic investments and acquisitions\n15,249 \n4,501 \nLoss on disposal, abandonment, and impairment of property, equipment and intangible assets, net\n— \n317 \nLoss recoveries\n— \n(3,404)\nInventory step-up amortization\n609 \n— \nLitigation costs and related recoveries\n1,761 \n241 \nPayroll taxes related to 2019 XSPP vesting and 2018 CEO Performance Award option exercises\n2,645 \n9,011 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n521,375 \n$\n331,396 \n49\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted gross margin reconciles to gross margin as follows (in thousands):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nTASER\nSoftware and Sensors\nTotal\nTASER\nSoftware and Sensors\nTotal\nGross margin\n480,031\n761,349\n1,241,380\n371,533\n583,920\n955,453\nStock-based compensation expense\n34,906\n25,183\n60,089\n2,234\n4,361\n6,595\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n31\n13,338\n13,369\n1\n3,143\n3,144\nInventory step-up amortization\n—\n609\n609\n—\n—\n—\nAdjusted gross margin\n$\n514,968\n$\n800,479\n$\n1,315,447\n$\n373,768\n$\n591,424\n$\n965,192\nGross margin\n58.6 \n%\n60.2 \n%\n59.6 \n%\n60.6 \n%\n61.6 \n%\n61.2 \n%\nAdjusted gross margin\n62.9 \n%\n63.3 \n%\n63.2 \n%\n60.9 \n%\n62.4 \n%\n61.8 \n%\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDollar Change\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n454,844 \n$\n598,545 \n$\n(143,701)\nAvailable-for-sale investments\n333,235 \n644,054 \n(310,819)\nTotal \n$\n788,079 \n$\n1,242,599 \n$\n(454,520)\nOur most significant source of liquidity continues to be funds generated by operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2024, we had $454.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $143.7 million from December 31, 2023. Refer below for further discussions related to the change in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024, we had $333.2 million of available-for-sale investments, a decrease of $310.8 million from December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of the natural maturity of short term investments reinvested into cash and cash equivalents until utilized for our acquisition activity in the period.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Agreement') is available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $200.0 million, $30.0 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, no amounts were drawn under the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately $7.8 million under the facility and available borrowing of $192.2 million. Refer to \nNote 12 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K\n for additional details related to our Credit Agreement and outstanding letters of credit.\nWe believe we have access to additional financing. However, there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements, including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions or investments, income and payroll tax payments for net-settled stock awards, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We and our Board of Directors may consider repurchases of our common stock. Further repurchases of our common stock would take place on the open market, would be financed with available cash and are subject to authorization as well as market and business conditions.\nGoing forward, we expect to continue to be an opportunistic issuer of debt securities and may issue new debt securities from time to time to fund our growth or refinance future debt maturities, among other things. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire our debt securities (including our 2027 Notes) through open market purchases, redemptions, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we may from time to time determine, for cash or other consideration.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, \nDollar\nChange\n2024\n2023\nOperating activities\n$\n408,312 \n$\n189,263 \n$\n219,049 \nInvesting activities\n(490,573)\n12,476 \n(503,049)\nFinancing activities\n(45,437)\n41,314 \n(86,751)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(6,209)\n2,065 \n(8,274)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(133,907)\n$\n245,118 \n$\n(379,025)\nOperating activities\nYear Ended December 31, \nDollar\nChange\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\n377,034 \n$\n175,783 \n$\n201,251 \nStock-based compensation\n382,604 \n131,358 \n251,246 \nFair value adjustments on strategic investments and marketable securities, net\n(283,217)\n41,785 \n(325,002)\nDeferred income taxes\n(85,096)\n(72,497)\n(12,599)\nInventory and accounts payable\n55,126 \n(12,297)\n67,423 \nReceivables and contract assets\n(245,842)\n(178,989)\n(66,853)\nDeferred revenue\n155,641 \n146,819 \n8,822 \nOther, net\n52,062 \n(42,699)\n94,761 \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n408,312 \n$\n189,263 \n$\n219,049 \nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2024 of $408.3 million consisted of $377.0 million in net income, a net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $104.0 million and a $72.7 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. Included in the non-cash items were $382.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, $283.2 million in fair value adjustments for the realized and unrealized gains (losses) on our strategic investments and marketable securities, $48.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense and $85.1 million in deferred income taxes. The change in fair value adjustments on strategic investments and marketable securities was primarily driven by the realized gains on the acquisition of two previously held strategic investments, an observable price change for an existing strategic investment and related warrants, and fair value gains for our marketable securities. The change in receivables and contract assets was largely attributable to increased sales in 2024, particularly for sales made under subscription plans. This was partly offset by the change in deferred revenue due to the timing of billing events. The change in inventory and accounts payable was largely due to advanced raw material purchases for Axon Body 4 and TASER 10 CEDs to support future sales. The change in deferred income taxes was primarily driven by R&D capitalization and additional GAAP expense for unvested stock-based compensation, partially offset by non-taxable unrealized net investment gains.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $490.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $12.5 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The net investing cash outflow is driven by $621.8 million related to acquiring two previously held strategic investments, $113.4 million for strategic investments, and $78.8 million for purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds, partially offset by $1.0 billion of proceeds from calls, maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments, less purchases of $680.0 million. This net cash outflow is primarily driven by greater acquisition and strategic investment activities in the current period, when contrasted with the prior comparable period.\n51\nTable of Contents\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $41.3 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The net financing cash outflow in the current period is driven by the payment of income and payroll taxes on behalf of employees who net-settled stock awards during the period, whereas the net financing cash inflow in the prior comparable period was primarily driven by net proceeds from our ATM offering and cash received from the exercise of stock options where shares were sold to cover the exercise price, partially offset by the payment of income and payroll taxes on behalf of employees who net-settled stock awards during the period.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table outlines our future contractual financial obligations by period in which payment is expected, as of December 31, 2024 (in thousands):\nTotal\nShort\nTerm\nLong\nTerm\nOperating lease obligations\n$\n69,466 \n$\n13,791 \n$\n55,675 \nPurchase obligations\n909,675 \n504,270 \n405,405 \nPrincipal and interest payable on our convertible senior notes\n699,996 \n3,383 \n696,613 \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n1,679,137 \n$\n521,444 \n$\n1,157,693 \nOperating lease obligations include operating leases for office space, manufacturing and logistical functions, discussed further within Note 18 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We regularly evaluate our real estate needs to identify opportunities to reduce long-term cash requirements where practicable. \nPurchase obligations include both open purchase orders and other purchase commitments, discussed further within Note 13 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The open purchase orders represent both cancellable and non-cancellable purchase orders with key vendors, which are included in this table due to our strategic relationships with these vendors.\nIn December 2022, we issued $690.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes (the \"Notes\") in a private offering, which aggregate principal amount included the exercise in full of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase up to an additional $90.0 million principal amount of the Notes. The Notes mature on December 15, 2027 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.50% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2023. On or after December 22, 2025, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes in accordance with the optional redemption terms of the convertible debt agreement. For additional details, refer to Note 12 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nObligations related to our uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement. For additional details, refer to Note 14 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe have identified the following accounting estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe that a significant change in these estimates is reasonably likely, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value, using a standard cost method which approximates the first-in, first-out method. Additional provisions are made to reduce excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories to their net realizable value. These provisions are based on our best estimate after considering historical demand, projected future \n52\nTable of Contents\ndemand, inventory purchase commitments, industry and market trends, and a variety of other factors. Changes in these underlying assumptions can materially affect our provisions and the resulting net realizable value of our inventories. For additional discussion, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from two primary sources: (1) the sale of physical products, including CEDs, Axon cameras, Axon Signal-enabled devices, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as Axon docks, cartridges and batteries, among others, and (2) subscriptions to our Axon Evidence digital evidence management SaaS offering (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. To a lesser extent, we also recognize revenue from training, professional services and other software and SaaS services. We apply the five-step model outlined in ASC 606, as discussed further in Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in ASC 606. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our estimate of the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each distinct good or service in the contract. Revenues are recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns. For additional discussion, refer to Note 2 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe determine the term of our arrangements based on identifying the contract with the customer. In certain of our arrangements, the customer may have termination rights. In these instances, we determine if there is a substantive penalty. For contracts with a substantive penalty, the accounting term will be the legal contract term, inclusive of the periods for which the customer termination rights exist. In these contracts with no substantive penalty, we also consider if the option for our customer to purchase additional goods or services represents an additional performance obligation in the form of a material right.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We generally have an unconditional right to consideration when we invoice our customers and record a receivable. We record a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue) when revenue will be recognized subsequent to invoicing. For additional discussion, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include a change in the product mix, a change in the way products are created, produced or delivered, or a significant change in the way products are branded and marketed. In performing the review for recoverability, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss, if impairment exists, is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair values computed using discounted cash flows. As such, the key inputs into this analysis are inherently subject to uncertainty and require significant judgments to be made.\nFinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives; rather such assets are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. In performing our annual impairment assessments for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we consider a variety of factors including (1) events impacting the carrying value or composition of a reporting unit or asset group, respectively, (2) changes in the macroeconomic environment, (3) adverse changes in our financial performance, (4) industry and market conditions, among others. Any significant changes in these underlying assumptions may significantly affect our impairment conclusions and net book value of corresponding assets in our consolidated financial statements. Based on our annual impairment assessments in the fourth quarter of 2024, no goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment was indicated. For additional details, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n53\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards.\nOur calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws domestically and internationally, or changes in other facts or circumstances.\nDeferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, the future reversals of deferred tax liabilities, forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income can affect the realization of net deferred tax assets. We exercise significant judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred income tax assets.\nWe operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions, generally years after our returns are filed. These returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws. We record uncertain tax positions when it has been determined that it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We use the criteria established in the accounting guidance to determine whether an item meets the definition of more-likely-than-not. The Company’s policy is to recognize these uncertain tax positions when the more-likely than-not threshold is met, when the statute of limitations has expired or upon settlement. Changes in assessments may result in income tax benefit or additional expense in our consolidated financial statements. For additional details, refer to Note 14 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have historically utili\nzed stock-based compensation for key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining talented personnel. We recognize compensation expense for our stock-based compensation program, which includes grants of service-based restricted stock units (\n“\nRSUs\n”\n), performance-based restricted stock units (\n“\nPSUs\n”\n), and performance-based stock options (\n“\nstock options\n”\n). \nVesting of performance stock units is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria including, successful and timely development and market acceptance of future product introductions and ongoing market performance, among others. Compensation expense for performance awards is recognized based on our best estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied using the most currently available projections, adjusted at each balance sheet date. \nOur performance-based restricted stock units include eXponential stock units (\n“\nXSUs\n”\n) granted under the Axon Enterprise, Inc. 2024 Employee eXponential Stock Plan (the \n“\n2024 Employee XSP\n”\n) and the 2024 CEO Performance Award\n discussed further in Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2024 XSU awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is considered the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period for each respective tranche. We utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate a range of possible future stock price goals over the term of the awards at each of the respective grant dates, the median of which was used as the basis for the derived service period for each tranche. Furthermore, we measured the grant date fair value of each tranche utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation which considered various assumptions, including expected volatility and an illiquidity discount. \nThis simulation is based on a subjective assessment of our forward-looking financial projections, taking into consideration statistical analysis. There is significant judgment required to determine the requisite service period, grant date fair value, and probability of the performance criteria being satisfied. \nChanges in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimates of the fair value of the awards and timing of recognition of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in our consolidated statements \nof operations and comprehensive income. For additional details, refer to Note 1 and Note 16 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n54\nTable of Contents\nContingencies and Accrued Litigation Expense\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including product-related and other litigation. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. We do not believe any currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. For additional details, refer to Note 13 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStrategic Investments\nWe have strategic investments which include equity and debt investments in a number of non-public technology driven companies. The strategic investments are generally accounted for under the ASC 321 measurement alternative for equity securities without readily determinable fair values, as there are no quoted market prices for the equity investments. Accordingly, the equity investments will be carried at cost less impairment. These investments will be subsequently remeasured to fair value upon observable price changes in an orderly transaction for the identical or similar investments. Additionally, if a qualitative assessment identifies impairment indicators, then the equity investments must be evaluated for impairment and written down to fair value in the event carrying value exceeds fair value. The debt strategic investment and the associated embedded derivatives are accounted for utilizing the fair value option and remeasured through earnings on a periodic basis. For additional details relating to our valuation techniques, refer to Note 1 and Note 8 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase consideration to the liabilities assumed, intangible assets and other assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Additionally, in step acquisitions in which we acquire incremental equity interests that provide us control of a business, the previously held equity interest is remeasured to fair value at the date the controlling interest is acquired. \nCritical estimates used in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, significant assumptions with respect to time and resources required to recreate the assets acquired, actual and forecasted cash flows, long-term growth rates, market royalty rates, and discount rates associated, amongst other factors. The values and estimated useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired in business combinations impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. Remeasurement of previously held equity interests to fair value is also dependent on these estimates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may vary. For additional details, r\nefer to Note 21 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n55\nTable of Contents",
