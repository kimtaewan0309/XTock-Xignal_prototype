See further discussion in Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” \nWe operate freight service over lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations and conduct freight operations over trackage owned or leased by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, Virginia Passenger Rail Authority (VPRA), and Michigan Department of Transportation.\nThe following table sets forth certain statistics relating to our operations for the past five years:\n \n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nRevenue ton miles (billions)\n178 \n176 \n179 \n178 \n164 \nRevenue per thousand revenue ton miles\n$\n68.09 \n$\n69.05 \n$\n71.35 \n$\n62.56 \n$\n59.67 \nRevenue ton miles (thousands) per railroad employee\n8,846 \n8,719 \n9,513 \n9,694 \n8,191 \nRatio of railway operating expenses to railway \noperating revenues (railway operating ratio)\n66.4%\n76.5%\n62.3%\n60.1%\n69.3%\nRAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES\n \n–\n Total railway operating revenues were $12.1 billion in 2024.  Following is an overview of our three commodity groups.  See the discussion of merchandise revenues by major commodity group, intermodal revenues, and coal revenues and tonnage in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n \nMERCHANDISE\n \n–\n Our merchandise commodity group is composed of four groupings: \n•\nAgriculture, forest and consumer products includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, livestock and poultry feed, food products, food oils, flour, sweeteners, ethanol, lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, beverages, and canned goods.\n•\nChemicals includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products (including crude oil), chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, sand, and natural gas liquids.\n•\nMetals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, minerals, clay, transportation equipment, and items for the U.S. military.\n•\nAutomotive includes finished motor vehicles and automotive parts.\nK5\nIn 2024, we handled 2.3 million merchandise carloads, which accounted for 62% of our total railway operating revenues.\nINTERMODAL\n \n–\n Our intermodal commodity group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers.  These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, premium customers, and asset-owning companies.  In 2024, we handled 4.1 million intermodal units, which accounted for 25% of our total railway operating revenues.\n \nCOAL\n \n–\n Coal revenues accounted for 13% of our total railway operating revenues in 2024.  We handled 76.7 million tons, or 0.7 million carloads, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins received via the Memphis and Chicago gateways.  Our coal franchise supports the electric generation market, directly serving 18 coal-fired power plants, as well as the export, domestic metallurgical, and industrial markets, primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River, at Lamberts Point in Norfolk, Virginia, at the Port of Baltimore, and on Lake Erie.\nFREIGHT RATES\n \n–\n Our predominant pricing mechanisms, private contracts and exempt price quotes, are not subject to regulation.  In general, market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices.\n \nRAILWAY PROPERTY\n \nOur railroad infrastructure makes us capital intensive with net properties of approximately $36 billion on a historical cost basis.\nProperty Additions\n \n–\n Property additions for the past five years were as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n \n($ in millions)\nRoad and other property\n$\n1,711 \n$\n1,525 \n$\n1,345 \n$\n1,041 \n$\n1,046 \nAcquisition of assets of CSR\n1,643 \n22 \n— \n— \n— \nEquipment\n670 \n802 \n603 \n429 \n448 \nTotal\n$\n4,024 \n$\n2,349 \n$\n1,948 \n$\n1,470 \n$\n1,494 \nOur capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to support our ability to provide safe, efficient, and reliable rail transportation services.\nK6\nEquipment\n \n–\n Our equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and railcars; maintenance of way equipment and machinery; other equipment and tools used in our shops, offices, and facilities; and vehicles and other equipment used for maintenance, transportation, and other activities.  Our equipment includes both owned equipment acquired by us and equipment held under lease arrangements.

Approximately 40% of our lines, excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2024.  \nThe following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nTrack miles of rail installed\n559 \n584 \n541 \n458 \n418 \nMiles of track surfaced\n3,957 \n4,013 \n4,155 \n4,225 \n4,785 \nCrossties installed (millions)\n2.1 \n2.1 \n2.2 \n2.0 \n1.8 \nTraffic Control\n \n–\n Of the 16,200 route miles we dispatch, 11,300 miles are equipped with signalization.  This includes 8,500 miles governed by Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) and 2,800 miles utilizing Automatic Block Signals.  Within the 8,500 CTC miles, 7,600 miles are controlled wirelessly through our data radio network and other infrastructure.\n \nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n \n–\n Compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one of our principal goals.  With the exception of our response to the Eastern Ohio Incident (the “Incident” as defined in Note 18) such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  For further information on the Incident and environmental matters, see Note 18 in Item 8 “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” \n \nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nWorkforce\n \n–\n We employed an average of 20,200 employees during 2024 and 19,600 employees at the end of 2024.  Approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions and referred to as “craft” employees.  See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  The remainder of our workforce is composed of management employees.  \n \nSafety\n \n–\n Safety is a core value at Norfolk Southern.  We are dedicated to providing employees with a safe workplace and the knowledge and tools they need to work safely and return home safely every day.  Our commitment to an injury-free workplace is outlined in our Risk Reduction Program, which focuses on safety policies and procedures, risk-based hazard management program, safety outreach and communications, technology analysis and implementation, and collaboration with craft employees.  Our safety programs, practices, and messaging further reinforce the importance of working safely including the imperative to speak up with ideas and concerns as well as reinforce the universal authority to stop work if ever unsure or detect a risk that is not adequately safeguarded.  We measure employee safety performance through internal metrics such as accidents, injuries, and serious injuries per 200,000 employee-hours.  We also use metrics established by the Federal Railroad \nK8\nAdministration (FRA) to measure FRA-reportable accidents per million train miles and injuries per 200,000 employee-hours.  Given that safety continues to be a top priority, and the importance of safety among our workforce and to our business, our Board of Directors (Board) has a standing Safety Committee that, among other duties, reviews, monitors, and evaluates our compliance with our safety programs and practices.\nCraft Workforce Levels and Productivity\n \n–\n Maintaining appropriate headcount levels for our craft-employee workforce is critical to our on-time and consistent delivery of customers’ goods and operational efficiency goals.  We manage this human capital metric through forecasting tools designed to ensure the optimal level of staffing to meet business demands.  We measure and monitor employee productivity based on various factors, including gross ton miles per train and engine employee.\nAttracting and Retaining Management Employees\n \n–\n Our talent strategy for management employees is essential to attracting strong candidates in a competitive talent environment.  We evaluate the effectiveness of that strategy by studying market trends, benchmarking the attractiveness of our employee value proposition, maintaining a competitive compensation package, and analyzing retention data.  \nWe also focus on driving employee engagement, which is key to increasing employee productivity, retention, and safety.  We take a data-centric approach, including the use of periodic surveys among employees, to identify new initiatives that will help boost engagement and drive business results.  \nEmployee Development and Training\n \n–\n We provide a range of developmental programs, opportunities, skills, and resources for our employees to be successful in their careers.  We provide classroom instruction, hands-on training and simulation-based training designed to improve on-the-job effectiveness and safety outcomes.  \nWe also use modern learning and performance technologies to offer robust professional growth opportunities.  Through on-demand digital course offerings, custom-built learning paths, and in-person facilitated content, our programs provide a holistic and inclusive approach to professional development throughout an employee's career.  \nWorkplace Experience\n \n–\n As a leading transportation service company, we recognize that success in the global marketplace relies on the recruitment and retention of top-tier talent, as well as leveraging the expertise and experiences of individuals from all backgrounds.  \nIn pursuit of this goal, we are dedicated to establishing a workplace where a broad spectrum of identities, perspectives, and experiences is not only represented but also valued and empowered to thrive. \nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\n \n–\n In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, our railroads are subject to regulation by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB).  The STB has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB has jurisdiction to determine whether we are “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year.  A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.  This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. \n \nThe relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract.  Approximately 90% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.\n \nK9\nEfforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry, and such efforts may continue in 2025.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers, and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.  Accordingly, we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation. \nRailroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by Congress and regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) (including the FRA) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)), which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety, security, and cybersecurity.  \nGovernment regulations are further discussed within Item 1A “Risk Factors,” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.\n \nCOMPETITION\n \n–\n There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company.  Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.  Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.\nOur primary rail competitor is CSX Corporation (CSX); both we and CSX operate throughout much of the same territory.  Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  We also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.\n \nCertain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets. \nSECURITY OF OPERATIONS\n – We continue to enhance the security of our rail system.  Our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.  The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the risk of terrorist, extremist, or seriously disruptive cyber-attack increases or decreases.  The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas: (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.  All of our Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change. \nOur security plan also complies with DOT security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.  As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs.  Additionally, location-specific security plans are in place for rail corridors in certain metropolitan areas referred to as High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA).  Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in a HTUA by: (1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local, and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest.  \nWe also operate four facilities that are under U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Maritime Security Regulations.  With respect to these facilities, each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and remains subject to inspection by the USCG.  \nK10\nAdditionally, we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the DHS, the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FRA, the USCG, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Defense, and various state Homeland Security offices.  \nIn 2024, through the Norfolk Southern Operation Awareness and Response Program as well as participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response Program, we provided rail accident response training to more than 5,500 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel, utilizing a combination of online training and face-to-face training sessions as well as the Norfolk Southern Safety Train.  We also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Center.\nWe also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning, with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks.  Our risk-based information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks, to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives, and to keep us in the best position to detect, mitigate, and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion.",
  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n  \nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes.  Refer to Item 8 “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for all “Note” references.\n \nOVERVIEW\nSince 1827, Norfolk Southern Corporation and its predecessor companies have safely moved the goods and materials that drive the U.S. economy.  Our dedicated team members deliver a wide variety of commodities annually for our customers, from agriculture products to consumer goods, and help them reduce carbon emissions by shipping via rail.  We have the most extensive intermodal network in the eastern U.S.  Our network serves a majority of the country's population and manufacturing base, with connections to every major container port on the Atlantic coast as well as major ports in the Gulf of Mexico and Great Lakes. \n \nIn 2024, we executed on various initiatives to operate our network more safely and efficiently, better serve our customers, and increase productivity in order to deliver improved financial performance.  We enhanced our executive leadership team and continued to execute on our strategy of providing high-quality service to our customers to enable smart, sustainable growth and delivering on productivity initiatives.  Additionally, we executed on several strategic initiatives, including the purchase of the Cincinnati Southern Railway, sales of certain railway lines, and completion of targeted rationalization and restructuring efforts, to further advance our organizational objectives.  Furthermore, we continued our efforts related to the Eastern Ohio Incident (as defined and further described in Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), including the pursuit of recoveries under our insurance programs.\nOur operational improvements during the year, while handling 5% higher volumes, helped drive improvements to income from railway operations, diluted earnings per share, and railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses).  For the full year, we achieved an operating ratio of 66.4%, and an adjusted operating ratio of 65.8% (see our non-GAAP reconciliations beginning on page K26), both of which improved on a year-over-year basis.  We remain committed to being a safe, productive, resilient, and efficient railroad with industry-competitive margins.\nSUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nvs. 2023\nvs. 2022\n \n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\n(% change)\nRailway operating revenues\n$\n12,123 \n$\n12,156 \n$\n12,745 \n— \n%\n(5 \n%)\nRailway operating expenses\n$\n8,052 \n$\n9,305 \n$\n7,936 \n(13 \n%)\n17 \n%\nIncome from railway operations\n$\n4,071 \n$\n2,851 \n$\n4,809 \n43 \n%\n(41 \n%)\nNet income\n$\n2,622 \n$\n1,827 \n$\n3,270 \n44 \n%\n(44 \n%)\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n11.57 \n$\n8.02 \n$\n13.88 \n44 \n%\n(42 \n%)\nRailway operating ratio (percent)\n66.4 \n76.5 \n62.3 \n(13 \n%)\n23 \n%\nIncome from railway operations, net income and diluted earnings per share increased in 2024 compared to 2023,  primarily as a result of lower railway operating expenses.  The reduction in our operating expenses includes lower net expenses related to the Eastern Ohio Incident and $433 million of gains on the sale of railway lines.  Railway operating revenues were slightly lower as decreased fuel surcharge revenue, an adverse mix of traffic, and decreased pricing were nearly offset by increased volumes.  Our railway operating ratio improved to 66.4 percent. \nIncome from railway operations, net income and diluted earnings per share declined in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by expenses incurred with our response efforts to the Incident, lower railway operating revenues, and higher \nK25\nnon-Incident-related railway operating expenses.  Railway operating revenues declined 5% due to lower average revenue per unit, the result of lower fuel surcharge revenue and decreased intermodal storage service revenues partially offset by favorable pricing and mix.  Additionally, lower volumes contributed to the decline in revenues.  Net expenses associated with the Incident for the year 2023 were $1.1 billion.  In addition to costs resulting from the Incident, railway operating expenses increased due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs, offset partially by lower fuel prices.  The decline in net income and diluted earnings per share also reflects the absence of a prior year $136 million deferred tax benefit, a result of an enactment of a change in the corporate income tax rate in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2022.  Railway operating ratio deteriorated to 76.5 percent. \nThe following tables adjust our 2024 and 2023 U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial results to exclude gains on railway line sales, restructuring and other charges (including the curtailment gain on our other postretirement benefit plan which is included in “Other income \n–\n net”), shareholder advisory costs, and a deferred income tax adjustment, all which occurred in 2024, as well as the effects of the Incident that were present in both years.  The income tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments were calculated based on the applicable tax rates to which the non-GAAP adjustments related.

Lower other income-net and higher interest expense on debt contributed to net income and diluted earnings per share that were only up slightly compared to the prior year.   \nIn 2023, on a non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of direct costs resulting from the Incident, income from railway operations decreased due to lower railway operating revenues and higher railway operating expenses.  Railway operating revenues declined due to decreased fuel surcharge revenue, decreased intermodal storage revenues, and lower volume, partially offset by increased pricing and favorable mix compared to the prior year.  Railway operating expenses increased due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs, partially offset by lower fuel prices.\nK27\nDETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRailway Operating Revenues\nThe following tables present a three-year comparison of revenues, volumes (units), and average revenue per unit by commodity group.    \nRevenues\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nvs. 2023\nvs. 2022\n($ in millions)\n(% change)\nMerchandise:\nAgriculture, forest and consumer\n    products\n$\n2,521 \n$\n2,530 \n$\n2,493 \n— \n%\n1 \n%\nChemicals\n2,123 \n2,054 \n2,148 \n3 \n%\n(4 \n%)\nMetals and construction\n1,682 \n1,634 \n1,652 \n3 \n%\n(1 \n%)\nAutomotive\n1,144 \n1,135 \n1,038 \n1 \n%\n9 \n%\n     Merchandise\n7,470 \n7,353 \n7,331 \n2 \n%\n— \n%\nIntermodal\n3,042 \n3,090 \n3,681 \n(2 \n%)\n(16 \n%)\nCoal\n1,611 \n1,713 \n1,733 \n(6 \n%)\n(1 \n%)\n Total\n$\n12,123 \n$\n12,156 \n$\n12,745 \n— \n%\n(5 \n%)\nUnits\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nvs. 2023\nvs. 2022\n(in thousands)\n(% change)\nMerchandise:\nAgriculture, forest and consumer\n    products\n741.7 \n734.3 \n723.0 \n1 \n%\n2 \n%\nChemicals\n518.3 \n515.0 \n540.1 \n1 \n%\n(5 \n%)\nMetals and construction\n641.6 \n634.1 \n634.6 \n1 \n%\n— \n%\nAutomotive\n362.7 \n361.5 \n339.1 \n— \n%\n7 \n%\n     Merchandise\n2,264.3 \n2,244.9 \n2,236.8 \n1 \n%\n— \n%\nIntermodal\n4,107.7 \n3,822.4 \n3,913.1 \n7 \n%\n(2 \n%)\nCoal\n684.8 \n677.1 \n684.6 \n1 \n%\n(1 \n%)\nTotal\n7,056.8 \n6,744.4 \n6,834.5 \n5 \n%\n(1 \n%)\nRevenue per Unit\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nvs. 2023\nvs. 2022\n($ per unit)\n(% change)\nMerchandise:\nAgriculture, forest and consumer\n    products\n$\n3,399 \n$\n3,445 \n$\n3,448 \n(1 \n%)\n— \n%\nChemicals\n4,096 \n3,989 \n3,978 \n3 \n%\n— \n%\nMetals and construction\n2,621 \n2,577 \n2,604 \n2 \n%\n(1 \n%)\nAutomotive\n3,155 \n3,140 \n3,059 \n— \n%\n3 \n%\n     Merchandise\n3,299 \n3,275 \n3,277 \n1 \n%\n— \n%\nIntermodal\n740 \n808 \n941 \n(8 \n%)\n(14 \n%)\nCoal\n2,352 \n2,530 \n2,532 \n(7 \n%)\n— \n%\n Total\n1,718 \n1,802 \n1,865 \n(5 \n%)\n(3 \n%)\nK28\nRevenues decreased $33 million in 2024 and $589 million in 2023 compared to the prior years.  Revenues decreased in 2024 as a result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by lower fuel surcharge revenue, adverse mix, and decreased pricing, partially offset by higher volume.  Revenues declined in 2023 as a result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by decreases in fuel surcharge and intermodal storage revenues, and volume declines.\nThe table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group.  \n 2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nIncrease (Decrease)\nIncrease (Decrease)\n($ in millions)\nMerchandise\nIntermodal\nCoal\nMerchandise\nIntermodal\nCoal\nVolume \n$\n64 \n$\n231 \n$\n19 \n$\n26 \n$\n(85)\n$\n(19)\nFuel surcharge\nrevenue\n(131)\n(101)\n(29)\n(119)\n(208)\n(23)\nRate, mix and\nother\n184 \n(178)\n(92)\n115 \n(298)\n22 \nTotal\n$\n117 \n$\n(48)\n$\n(102)\n$\n22 \n$\n(591)\n$\n(20)\n \nApproximately 95% of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges.  Fuel surcharge revenues totaled $962 million, $1.2 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  The decline in fuel surcharge revenues in each period was primarily driven by fluctuations in fuel commodity prices.\nFor 2025, we expect that revenue will increase driven by higher volumes.\nMERCHANDISE\n revenues increased in both 2024 and 2023 compared with the prior years.  In 2024, revenues rose as volume was higher for all commodity groups and pricing gains more than offset lower fuel surcharge revenue.  In 2023, revenues were slightly higher as pricing and volume gains were nearly offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and unfavorable mix.  Increased volumes in automotive and agriculture, forest and consumer shipments were partially offset by decreased chemicals shipments.\nAgriculture, forest and consumer products \nrevenues decreased slightly in 2024 but increased in 2023 compared with the prior years.  In 2024, the decrease was the result of lower average revenue per unit driven by lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by increased price, and increased volume.  Increased volume in soybeans, corn, and feed were partially offset by lower volume in fertilizers and ethanol.  Soybean volume increased due to spot opportunities.  Increased corn and feed volumes were the result of customers shifting from truck to rail service to meet market demands.  The decrease in fertilizer volume was driven by lower potash shipments due to customer operational issues and cost pressures.  Ethanol volume declined primarily as a result of decreased demand.  In 2023, higher revenues were the result of increased volume.  Average revenue per unit was flat, the result of lower fuel surcharge revenue offset by pricing gains.  Increases in ethanol and fertilizer shipments more than offset declines in shipments of wood chips and graphic paper.  Increased market demand led to volume gains in ethanol and fertilizer.  Volume declines in wood chips were due to customer mill closures, while lower market demand led to the decline in graphic paper.  \nChemicals \nrevenues increased in 2024 but decreased in 2023 compared with the prior years.  In 2024, the increase in revenues was driven by higher average revenue per unit driven by increased price, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue, and volume growth.  Solid waste and organic chemicals volume increased due to stronger demand.  These increases were slightly offset by declines in crude oil and petroleum products.  Volume declines in crude oil were due to a market share shift, while declines in petroleum were related to the conclusion of a spot opportunity handled last year to support a customer during a refinery outage.  In 2023, the decrease was as a result \nK29\nof volume declines.  Reduced shipments of crude oil, organic chemicals, and natural gas liquids, more than offset the increases in solid waste and other petroleum products.  Volume declines for crude oil were driven by soft demand in the energy markets.  Organic chemicals and natural gas liquids volume declined as a result of lower demand.  Volume gains in solid waste were due to growth with existing customers, while the gains in petroleum products were due to growth with existing customers and new business opportunities.\nMetals and construction \nrevenues were higher in 2024 but lower in 2023 compared with the prior years.  In 2024, the increase was driven by higher average revenue per unit due to favorable price, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue, and higher volume.  Increased volume was due to higher demand in aggregates, kaolin, miscellaneous construction, and scrap metal, partially offset by lower demand for coil steel shipments.  In 2023, the decline in revenue was driven by lower average revenue per unit, the result of decreased fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by increased price.  Volumes were nearly unchanged as reduced shipments of kaolin and construction materials were offset by volume gains in coil steel and scrap metal.  The volume declines in kaolin were largely driven by lower demand, while the declines in construction materials were due to lower demand, extended cycle times and service challenges.  Gains in coil steel volume were due to increased equipment available to handle demand, while scrap metal volume increased due to higher demand.  \nAutomotive \nrevenues rose in both 2024 and 2023 compared with the prior years.  The increase in revenues in 2024 was driven by slightly higher average revenue per unit driven by increased price, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue, and slightly higher volume.  Volume increases were due to improvements in equipment availability and their cycle time paired with higher demand, mostly offset by reduced production and quality holds at certain manufacturers, and extended plant shutdowns.  The increase in revenues in 2023 was driven by increased volume and higher average revenue per unit, driven by favorable price.  Volume increases were due to higher finished vehicle inventory levels available for rail transportation and improved equipment cycle times.\nINTERMODAL\n revenues decreased in both 2024 and 2023 compared with the prior years.  The decrease in 2024 was the result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by decreased pricing, lower fuel surcharge revenue, adverse mix, and declines in storage service revenues, partially offset by higher volume.  The decrease in 2023 was the result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by reduced storage service revenues and lower fuel surcharge revenue, and decreased volume. \nIntermodal units by market were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nvs. 2023\nvs. 2022\n \n(units in thousands)\n(% change)\nDomestic\n2,500.0 \n2,371.6 \n2,573.6 \n5 \n%\n(8 \n%)\nInternational\n1,607.7 \n1,450.8 \n1,339.5 \n11 \n%\n8 \n%\nTotal\n4,107.7 \n3,822.4 \n3,913.1 \n7 \n%\n(2 \n%)\nDomestic\n volume increased in 2024 but decreased in 2023 compared with the prior years.  In 2024, volume increased due to growth in new and existing customers and improved service, partially offset by reduced demand for premium shipments.  In 2023, volume declined due to a decrease in freight demand as a result of reduced consumer consumption combined with high inventories, and increased truck competition.   \nInternational\n volume increased in both 2024 and 2023.  The increase in 2024 was driven by increased demand, growth in existing customers, and increased movements of empty containers.  The increase in 2023 was driven by ocean carriers favoring inland point intermodal traffic, partially offset by a decrease in imports. \nK30\nCOAL\n revenues decreased in 2024 and 2023 compared with the prior years.  The decrease in 2024 was a result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by decreased pricing and lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by positive mix and increased volume.  The decrease in 2023 was a result of decreased volumes.  Average revenue per unit was flat as lower fuel surcharge revenue and pricing declines were offset by positive mix. \nAs shown in the following table, total tonnage increased in 2024 but decreased in 2023 compared to prior years.\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nvs. 2023\nvs. 2022\n \n(tons in thousands)\n(% change)\nUtility\n29,577 \n30,419 \n35,705 \n(3 \n%)\n(15 \n%)\nExport\n33,309 \n31,005 \n25,887 \n7 \n%\n20 \n%\nDomestic metallurgical\n10,088 \n11,096 \n11,307 \n(9 \n%)\n(2 \n%)\nIndustrial\n3,728 \n3,372 \n3,765 \n11 \n%\n(10 \n%)\nTotal\n76,702 \n75,892 \n76,664 \n1 \n%\n(1 \n%)\n    \nUtility coal\n tonnage decreased in both 2024 and 2023 compared with the prior years.  The decline in 2024 was due to reduced demand from continued low natural gas prices and high stockpiles.  The decrease in 2023 was due to low natural gas prices, high stockpiles, and unplanned customer outages.\nExport coal\n tonnage increased in both 2024 and 2023 compared with the prior years.  The increase in 2024 was due to growth with our customers and increased production.  The increase in 2023 was a result of increased demand and coal supply.\n \nDomestic metallurgical coal\n tonnage decreased in both 2024 and 2023 compared with the prior years.  The decrease in 2024 was as a result of reduced customer demand.  The decrease in 2023 was due to reduced coke shipments resulting from idled customer facilities.\nIndustrial coal\n tonnage increased in 2024 but decreased in 2023 compared with the prior years.  The growth in 2024 was due to higher demand.  The decrease in 2023 was due to reduced coal shipments related to customer sourcing changes.\nK31\nRailway Operating Expenses\nRailway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nvs. 2023\nvs. 2022\n \n($ in millions)\n(% change)\nCompensation and benefits\n$\n2,823 \n$\n2,819 \n$\n2,621 \n— \n%\n8 \n%\nPurchased services\n1,655 \n1,683 \n1,565 \n(2 \n%)\n8 \n%\nEquipment rents\n393 \n387 \n357 \n2 \n%\n8 \n%\nFuel\n987 \n1,170 \n1,459 \n(16 \n%)\n(20 \n%)\nDepreciation\n1,353 \n1,298 \n1,221 \n4 \n%\n6 \n%\nMaterials\n369 \n364 \n283 \n1 \n%\n29 \n%\nClaims\n237 \n242 \n270 \n(2 \n%)\n(10 \n%)\nOther\n(273)\n226 \n160 \n(221 \n%)\n41 \n%\nRestructuring and other charges\n183 \n— \n— \nEastern Ohio incident\n325 \n1,116 \n— \n(71 \n%)\nTotal\n$\n8,052 \n$\n9,305 \n$\n7,936 \n(13 \n%)\n17 \n%\nIn 2024, the decline in railway operating expenses reflects lower net expenses related to the Eastern Ohio incident (Note 18), higher gains on operating property sales, including certain gains on railway line sales (Note 8), and lower fuel prices, partially offset by restructuring and other charges (Note 3), and increased depreciation on our higher asset base.  In 2023, expenses increased as we incurred $1.1 billion of costs related to environmental matters and legal proceedings resulting from the Incident (Note 18).  Additionally, railway operating expenses reflected higher costs due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs.  Partially offsetting these increases were the impacts of lower fuel prices and the absence of retroactive wage increases recorded in 2022.\nCompensation and benefits \nincreased in 2024, reflecting changes in:\n•\npay rates (up $91 million),\n•\nincentive and stock-based compensation (up $56 million),\n•\novertime (down $37 million),\n•\nemployee activity levels (down $68 million), and\n•\nother (down $38 million).\nIn 2023, compensation and benefits increased, a result of changes in:\n•\nemployee activity levels (up $138 million),\n•\npay rates (up $86 million), \n•\novertime (up $9 million),\n•\nincentive and stock-based compensation (down $30 million), and\n•\nother (down $5 million).\nOur employment averaged 20,200 in 2024, compared with 20,300 in 2023, and 18,900 in 2022. \nK32\nPurchased services\n includes the costs of services purchased from external vendors and contractors, including the net costs of operating joint facilities with other railroads.  The decrease in purchased services in 2024 was due to lower lease costs and declines in technology-related and operational expenses, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses and Conrail-related activity.  The increase in purchased services in 2023 was due to higher technology-related costs, increased operational and transportation expenses, and higher engineering activity.\nEquipment rents\n, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, increased in both periods.  In 2024, the increase was due to increased automotive and intermodal equipment expenses as a result of higher volumes.  In 2023, the increase was due to increased intermodal equipment expenses, higher freight car lease costs, and decreased equity in TTX Company's (TTX) earnings.\nFuel\n expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, decreased in both 2024 and 2023.  The decrease in both periods was due to lower locomotive fuel prices (down 15% in 2024 and 20% in 2023), which decreased fuel expense by $159 million and $275 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Locomotive fuel consumption was down in 2024 and nearly flat in 2023 compared to prior periods.  We consumed 373 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2024, compared with 377 million gallons in 2023 and 376 million gallons in 2022.  \nDepreciation\n expense increased in both periods compared to the prior years, reflecting reinvestment in our infrastructure, rolling stock, and technology. \nMaterials\n expense increased in both 2024 and 2023.  The increase in 2024 was due to higher freight car repairs expense, partially offset by lower locomotive materials spending.  The increase in 2023 was due to increased locomotive, freight car, and track materials costs.\nClaims\n expense includes costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters.  Claims expense decreased in both 2024 and 2023 compared to the prior years.  The decrease in 2024 is the result of lower personal injury case development and declines in lading and property damage expenses.  These were partially offset by the absence of a prior-year claims-related recovery and higher insurance costs.  The decrease in 2023 was primarily the result of lower personal injury case development, lower costs related to environmental remediation matters unrelated to the Incident, and a claims-related recovery. \nOther\n expense decreased in 2024 primarily due to increased gains from operating property sales, lower non-income-based taxes, and lower relocation and travel-related expenses.  Gains from operating property sales includes $433 million of gains on the sale of railway lines in the states of Virginia and North Carolina.  These transactions are described further in Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The increase in 2023 was primarily due to lower gains from operating property sales and increased travel-related expenses.  Gains from operating property sales amounted to $490 million, $43 million, and $76 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nRestructuring and other charges\nIn 2024, we recorded $183 million in restructuring and other charges.  During the year, we completed voluntary and involuntary separation programs that reduced our management workforce.  Additionally, we ceased development of certain technology projects that had not been placed into service.  We also wrote down certain specialized equipment to its net realizable value, reflecting the planned disposition of that asset class.  Additionally, we incurred costs associated the appointment of our chief operating officer.  See Notes 3 and 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.    \nK33\nEastern Ohio incident\nDuring 2024, we incurred net expenses of $325 million associated with the Incident, including additional costs associated with environmental matters and legal proceedings.  The total amount recorded in 2024 is net of $650 million of insurance recoveries, resulting from claims made under our insurance policies in effect at the time of the Incident.  During 2023, we recorded $1.1 billion for costs primarily associated with environmental matters and legal proceedings.  We recorded $101 million of recoveries from claims made under our insurance policies, which are included in the total amount recorded in 2023.  Our cash expenditures attributable to the Incident, net of insurance proceeds received, were $119 million and $652 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and which are presented in “Net cash provided by operating activities” on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  For further details regarding the Incident, see Note 18 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Income – Net\nOther income – net decreased in 2024 but increased in 2023.  The decrease in 2024 reflects costs associated with shareholder matters, lower returns on corporate-owned life insurance (COLI), and higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense, partially offset by a $20 million curtailment gain on our other postretirement benefit plan as a result of our voluntary and involuntary separation programs (Note 3).  The increase in 2023 was the result of higher net returns on COLI and increased interest income, partially offset by lower gains from non-operating property sales.  \nIncome Taxes\n \nThe effective income tax rate was 21.2% in 2024, compared with 21.3% in 2023 and 20.8% in 2022.  The current year reflects a $15 million deferred income tax benefit due to a change in a state corporate income tax rate and a $27 million deferred income tax benefit from subsidiary restructuring.  These benefits were partially offset by the absence of certain business tax credits recognized in the prior year.  The 2023 effective rate benefited from tax credits and higher COLI returns offset by reduced benefits from stock-based compensation.  The effective income tax rate in 2022 reflects favorable benefits associated with stock-based compensation and various state law changes (Note 5). \nFor 2025, we expect an effective income tax rate between 23% and 24%.  \nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \nCash provided by operating activities,\n our principal source of liquidity, was $4.1 billion in 2024, $3.2 billion in 2023, and $4.2 billion in 2022.  The increase in 2024 reflects improved operating results.  The decrease in 2023 reflects lower operating results, offset in part by changes in working capital.  We had negative working capital of $357 million at December 31, 2024 and working capital of $639 million at December 31, 2023.  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.6 billion at both December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.  We expect that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations.  In addition, we believe our currently-available borrowing capacity, access to additional financing, ability to reduce shareholder distributions, and ability to moderate or defer property additions provide additional flexibility to meet our ongoing obligations in the short- and long-term.\nK34\nContractual obligations \nat December 31, 2024, including those that may have material cash requirements, include interest on fixed-rate long-term debt, long-term debt (Note 10), unconditional purchase obligations (Note 18), long-term advances from Conrail Inc. (Conrail) (Note 7), operating leases (Note 11), agreements with Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC) (Note 7), and unrecognized tax benefits (Note 5).\nTotal\n2025\n2026 -\n2027\n2028 -\n2029\n2030 and\nSubsequent\n \n($ in millions)\nInterest on fixed-rate long-term debt\n$\n19,413 \n$\n776 \n$\n1,472 \n$\n1,383 \n$\n15,782 \nLong-term debt principal\n18,108 \n555 \n1,223 \n1,212 \n15,118 \nUnconditional purchase obligations\n1,225 \n519 \n455 \n95 \n156 \nLong-term advances from Conrail\n534 \n— \n— \n— \n534 \nOperating leases\n314 \n89 \n116 \n62 \n47 \nAgreements with CRC\n209 \n47 \n94 \n68 \n— \nUnrecognized tax benefits*\n82 \n— \n— \n— \n82 \nTotal\n$\n39,885 \n$\n1,986 \n$\n3,360 \n$\n2,820 \n$\n31,719 \n \n*  This amount is shown in the 2030 and Subsequent column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated.\n \nOff balance sheet arrangements\n consist primarily of unrecognized obligations, including future interest payments on fixed-rate long-term debt and unconditional purchase obligations, which are included in the table above.  Additionally, in connection with our ownership of an equity method investment, we have the option to acquire an intermodal terminal located in the southern U.S. for an amount that will be determined subsequent to the potential exercise of that option.  Our option to purchase the terminal expires in the second quarter of 2025. \n \nCash used in investing activities\n was $2.8 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023, and $1.6 billion in 2022.  The increase in 2024 was driven by the acquisition of the assets of the CSR, partially offset by higher borrowings against our COLI policies and increased proceeds from property sales.  Please see Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on certain railway line sales and a discussion of the acquisition of the CSR assets.  In 2023, the increase was primarily driven by higher property additions and lower proceeds from property sales.\nCapital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the “Railway Property” section of Part I of this report on Form 10-K.  For 2025, we expect property additions to approximate $2.2 billion.\nCash used in financing activities\n was $1.2 billion in 2024, while cash provided by financing activities was $115 million in 2023, and cash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion in 2022.  The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2024 reflects lower proceeds from borrowing partially offset by the absence of repurchases of Common Stock.  In 2023, the increase in cash provided by financing activities reflects lower repurchases of Common Stock and increased proceeds from borrowings, partially offset by higher debt repayments.\nWe did not repurchase any Common Stock during 2024, while we repurchased $622 million in 2023 and $3.1 billion in 2022, which resulted in the retirement of 2.8 million and 12.6 million shares in 2023 and 2022, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024, $6.9 billion remains authorized by our Board of Directors for repurchase.  The timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  Repurchases may be executed in the open market, through derivatives, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) and Rule 10b-18 under the \nK35\nSecurities and Exchange Act of 1934.  Any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally-generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.\nIn June 2024, we entered into an agreement that provides us the ability to issue up to $800 million of unsecured commercial paper and is backed by our credit agreement.  The unsecured short-term commercial paper program provides for borrowing at prevailing rates and includes covenants.  At December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding commercial paper.  \nIn May 2024, we renewed our accounts receivable securitization program with a maximum borrowing capacity of $400 million.  Amounts under our accounts receivable securitization program are borrowed and repaid from time to time in the ordinary course for general corporate and cash management purposes.  The term of our accounts receivable securitization program expires in May 2025.  We had no amounts outstanding under this program and our available borrowing capacity was $400 million at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nIn January 2024, we renewed and amended our $800 million credit agreement.  The amended agreement expires in January 2029, and provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants.  We had no amounts outstanding under this facility at either December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023, and we are in compliance with all of its covenants.  \nIn January 2024, we also entered into a term loan credit agreement that established a 364-day, $1.0 billion, unsecured delayed draw term loan facility under which we could borrow for general corporate purposes.  The term loan credit agreement provided for borrowing at prevailing rates and included covenants that align with the $800 million credit agreement.  The term loan expired undrawn in October 2024.\n \nIn addition, we have investments in general purpose COLI policies and had the ability to borrow against these policies.  We had borrowed $605 million against these policies at December 31, 2024 and no amounts borrowed at December 31, 2023.  Our remaining borrowing capacity was $40 million and $640 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  In January 2025, we repaid all amounts that were borrowed against these policies at December 31, 2024.\nOur debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 54.6% at December 31, 2024, compared with 57.3% at December 31, 2023.  We discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in Note 10.  Upcoming annual debt maturities are also disclosed in Note 10.  Overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n \nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.  Accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  \n \nIncident Contingencies \nWe are currently involved in certain environmental response and remediation activities and subject to numerous legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and investigations relating to the Incident.  We have accrued estimates of the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these matters.  Our environmental estimates are based upon types of remediation efforts currently anticipated, the volume of contaminants in the impacted areas, and governmental oversight and other costs, amongst other factors.  Estimates associated with the legal proceedings to \nK36\nwhich we are subject are based on information that is currently available, including but not limited to an assessment of the proceedings and the potential and likely results of such proceedings.  \nOur current estimates of future environmental cleanup and remediation liabilities related to the Incident may change over time due to various factors, including but not limited to, the nature and extent of required future cleanup and removal activities (including those resulting from soil, water, sediment, and air assessment and investigative activities conducted at the site), and the extent and duration of governmental oversight, amongst other factors.  Additionally, the final outcome of any of the legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, and developments related to the progress of such legal proceedings, inquiries, or investigations or other unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional costs or new or additionally accrued amounts that could be material to our results of operations in any particular year.  Furthermore, certain costs may be recoverable under our insurance policies in effect at the date of the Incident or from third parties.  Any amounts that are recoverable under our insurance policies or from third parties will be reflected in the period in which recovery is considered probable.  \nSee Note 18 for more detailed information as it pertains to these contingencies.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\n \nAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (Note 13).  These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.  In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.  We make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).  We utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities.\n \nFor 2024, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.0%, which was supported by our long-term total rate of return on pension plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns.  A one-percentage point decrease to this rate of return assumption would result in a $24 million increase in annual pension expense.  We review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future.  The net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.  We utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  We use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.  A one-percentage point decrease to this discount rate assumption would result in a $14 million increase in annual pension expense.  \nProperties and Depreciation\n \nMost of our assets are long-lived railway properties (Note 8).  “Properties” are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate.  See Note 1 for a more detailed discussion of assumptions and estimates.\nExpenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized.  Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor, and other direct costs, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project.  A significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to self-constructed assets.  Costs related to repairs and \nK37\nmaintenance activities that, in our judgment, do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.\n \nDepreciation expense for 2024 totaled $1.4 billion.  Our composite depreciation rates for 2024 are disclosed in Note 8; a one-year increase (or decrease) in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate $51 million decrease (or increase) to annual depreciation expense.\nPersonal Injury\n \nClaims expense, included in “Materials and other” in the Consolidated Statements of Income, includes our estimate of costs for personal injuries.  \n \nTo aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent actuarial consulting firm.  The actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.  We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study.  The accuracy of our estimate of the liability is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and, as such, the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded. \nSee Note 18 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates we use for personal injury.\nIncome Taxes\n \nOur net deferred tax liability totaled $7.4 billion at December 31, 2024 (Note 5).  This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.  After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.  For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions.  A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.  We have a $42 million valuation allowance on $467 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, reflecting the expectation that substantially all of these assets will be realized.\nOTHER MATTERS\n \nLabor Agreements\nApproximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA), these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the RLA are completed.  Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements.  We largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers’ Conference Committee (NCCC).\nUnder current moratorium provisions, neither party was permitted to serve notice to compel a new round of mandatory collective bargaining until November 1, 2024.  In the months prior to the opening of the current national bargaining round, we engaged in voluntary local discussions with our labor unions and, as a result, reached local tentative agreements with ten of our thirteen unions.  A majority of those tentative agreements were subsequently ratified by union membership and became effective January 1, 2025, foreclosing the parties from serving new notices to compel mandatory bargaining until November 1, 2029.\nFor those unions with whom we have not yet reached a ratified agreement, the NCCC, on behalf of Norfolk Southern, sent bargaining notices on November 1, 2024, to commence mandatory direct negotiations as prescribed under the RLA.  Even if the parties are unable to reach voluntary agreement during this first phase of RLA \nK38\nbargaining, self-help (e.g., a strike or other work stoppage) related to this collective-bargaining process remains prohibited by law until a lengthy series of additional procedures mandated by the RLA, including federal mediation, are exhausted. \nMarket Risks\n \nWe manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating- rate debt instruments.  At December 31, 2024, we have no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations.  Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a one-percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2024 and amounts to an increase of approximately $1.5 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2024.  We consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1.\nInflation\n \nIn preparing financial statements, GAAP requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.  As a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets.  The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n \nCertain statements in this report, including in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.  These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or our achievements or those of our industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.  In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “consider,” “predict,” “potential,” “feel,” or other comparable terminology.  We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections.  While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.  The following important \nK39\nfactors, including those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors,” may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements:\n•\nour ability to successfully implement our operational, productivity, and strategic initiatives;\n•\nchanges in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those impacting the transportation industry;\n•\na significant adverse event on our network, including but not limited to a mainline accident, discharge of hazardous material, or climate-related or other network outage; \n•\nthe outcome of claims, litigation, governmental proceedings, and investigations involving the Company, including but not limited to the Incident Proceedings;\n•\nthe nature and extent of the Company's environmental remediation obligations with respect to the Incident;\n•\nnew or additional governmental regulation and/or operational changes resulting from or related to the Incident or the Incident Proceedings; and\n•\na significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure.\nThe forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date they were first issued, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAdditional Information\nInvestors and others should note that we routinely use the Investor Relations, Performance Metrics and Sustainability sections of our website (norfolksouthern.investorroom.com/key-investor-information, norfolksouthern.investorroom.com/weekly-performance-reports & www.norfolksouthern.com/sustainability) to post presentations to investors and other important information, including information that may be deemed material to investors.
