  "item1": "Item 1.\nBusiness.\nYum! Brands, Inc. (referred to herein as “YUM”, the “Registrant” or the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the state of North Carolina in 1997. The principal executive offices of YUM are located at 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40213, and the telephone number at that location is (502) 874-8300. Our website address is \nhttps://www.yum.com\n.\nYUM, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this Form 10-K annual report (“Form 10-K”) as the Company. The terms “we,” “us” and “our” are also used in the Form 10-K to refer to the Company. Throughout this Form 10-K, the terms “restaurants,” “stores” and “units” are used interchangeably. While YUM does not directly own or operate any restaurants, throughout this document we may refer to restaurants that are owned or operated by our subsidiaries as being Company-owned.\nOverview of Business\nYUM has over 61,000 restaurants in more than 155 countries and territories primarily operating under the four concepts of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger & Grill (the “Concepts”). The Company’s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands are global leaders of the chicken, Mexican-inspired food and pizza categories, respectively. Habit Burger & Grill is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. At December 31, 2024, 98% of our Concepts’ units are operated by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements. The terms franchise or franchisee within this Form 10-K are meant to describe third parties that operate units under either franchise or license agreements.  \nThe following is a brief description of each Concept and a summary of our Concepts’ operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nNumber of Units\n% of Units International\nNumber of Countries and Territories\n% Franchised\nSystem Sales\n(a)\n (in Millions)\nKFC Division\n31,981 \n89 \n%\n150 \n99 \n%\n$\n34,452 \nTaco Bell Division\n8,757 \n13 \n%\n33 \n94 \n%\n17,193 \nPizza Hut Division\n20,225 \n68 \n%\n111 \n99 \n%\n13,108 \nHabit Burger & Grill Division\n383 \n2 \n%\n3 \n17 \n%\n713 \nYUM\n61,346 \n70 \n%\n156 \n98 \n%\n$\n65,466 \n(a)    Constitutes sales of all restaurants, both Company-owned and franchised. See further discussion of this performance metric within Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nKFC\nKFC was founded in Corbin, Kentucky, by Colonel Harland D. Sanders, an early developer of the quick service food business and a pioneer of the restaurant franchise concept. The Colonel perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1939 and signed up his first franchisee in 1952. KFC restaurants across the world offer fried and non-fried chicken products such as sandwiches, chicken strips, chicken-on-the-bone and other chicken products marketed under a variety of names. \nTaco Bell\nThe first Taco Bell restaurant was opened in 1962 by Glen Bell in Downey, California, and in 1964, the first Taco Bell franchise was sold. Taco Bell specializes in Mexican-style food products, including various types of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads, nachos and other related items.\nPizza Hut\nThe first Pizza Hut restaurant was opened in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, and within a year, the first franchise unit was opened. Today, Pizza Hut specializes in the sale of ready-to-eat pizza products and operates in the delivery, carryout and casual dining segments around the world. \n3\nHabit Burger & Grill\nThe first Habit Burger & Grill restaurant opened in 1969 in Santa Barbara, California. The Habit Burger & Grill restaurant concept is built around a distinctive and diverse menu that includes chargrilled burgers and sandwiches made-to-order over an open flame and topped with fresh ingredients.\nBusiness Strategy\nThrough our Recipe for Good Growth we intend to deliver iconic restaurant brands and consistently drive better customer experiences, improved unit economics and higher rates of growth. Key enablers include accelerated use of digital and technology, increased collaboration and better leverage of our systemwide scale. This is done through a framework of three pillars: being Loved, Trusted and Connected.\nLoved: We grow by delighting customers with craveable food and a distinctive experience. We innovate and elevate our iconic restaurant brands that people trust and champion, resulting in relevant, easy and distinctive brands.\nTrusted: We operate responsibly with consistency and efficiency in our restaurants, across our system and in our communities. This includes a commitment to our priorities for social responsibility, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and planet.\nConnected: We use our teamwork, technology and global scale to serve every customer, everywhere, anytime. Our unmatched operating capability allows us to recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences. And our commitment to bold restaurant development drives market and franchise unit expansion with strong economics. \nOur unrivaled culture and talent and leading with smart, heart and courage are key to our success, fueling brand performance and franchise success. \nInformation about Operating Segments\nAs of December 31, 2024, YUM consists of four operating segments:  \n•\nThe KFC Division which includes our worldwide operations of the KFC concept\n•\nThe Taco Bell Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Taco Bell concept\n•\nThe Pizza Hut Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Pizza Hut concept\n•\nThe Habit Burger & Grill Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Habit Burger & Grill concept\nFranchise Agreements\nThe franchise programs of the Company are designed to promote consistency and quality, and the Company is selective in granting franchises. The Company is focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment, capability and capitalization to grow our Concepts. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publicly-traded companies. The Company has franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business, such as our relationship with Yum China (defined below) and our relationships with certain other large franchisees.\nThe Company currently has approximately 1,500 franchisees with whom we have franchise contracts. The Company utilizes both store-level franchise and master franchise programs to grow our businesses. Of our over 60,000 franchised units at December 31, 2024, approximately 35% operate under our master franchise programs, including over 15,400 units in mainland China.\n \nThe remainder of our franchise units operate under store-level franchise agreements. Under both types of franchise programs, franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land, building, equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business. In certain historical refranchising transactions the Company may have retained ownership of land and building and continues to lease them to the franchisee. Store-level franchise agreements typically require payment to the Company of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening of a store, fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee. Franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their restaurants’ sales (typically between 4% to 6%) and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand. Under master franchise arrangements, the Company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as sub-franchise restaurants within certain geographic territories. Master franchisees are typically responsible for overseeing development within their territories and performing certain other administrative duties with regard to the oversight of sub-franchisees. In exchange, \n4\nmaster franchisees retain a certain percentage of fees payable by the sub-franchisees under their franchise agreements and often pay lower fees for the restaurants they operate. \nOn October 31, 2016, we completed the spin-off of our China business into an independent, publicly-traded company under the name of Yum China Holdings, Inc. (“Yum China”). As our largest master franchisee, Yum China, pays the Company a continuing fee of 3% on system sales of our Concepts in mainland China. The use by Yum China of certain of our material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between Yum Restaurants Consulting (Shanghai) Company Limited, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Yum China, and YUM, through YRI China Franchising LLC, a subsidiary of YUM.\nThe Company seeks to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business, including products, technology, equipment, operational improvements and standards. \nRestaurant Operations\nThrough its Concepts, YUM develops, operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and non-traditional Quick Service Restaurants (“QSR”). Traditional units can feature dine-in, carryout, drive-thru and delivery services. Non-traditional units include express units that have a more limited menu, usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in non-traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, train stations, subways, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient.\nMost restaurants in each Concept offer consumers the ability to dine in, carryout and/or have the Concepts’ food delivered either by store-level personnel or third-party delivery services such as aggregators. In addition, Taco Bell, KFC and Habit Burger & Grill offer a drive-thru option in many stores. Pizza Hut offers a drive-thru option on a much more limited basis.  \nRestaurant management structure varies by Concept, unit size and franchise organization. Generally, each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager (“RGM”), together with one or more assistant managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. Each Concept issues manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs.  These manuals set forth standards and requirements for restaurant operations, including food safety and quality, food handling and product preparation procedures, equipment maintenance, facility standards and accounting control procedures. Each franchise organization and their respective restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their units, including all matters related to employment of restaurant staff, and for ensuring compliance with operating standards. \nDigital and technology are at the core of our Recipe for Good Growth. In recent years the Company has focused on building and acquiring a distinctive set of solutions with next-generation capabilities tailored for our brands and scaling these common digital and technology platforms across the globe. In 2024, we accelerated our technology transformation by integrating our digital and technology teams into a unified global team. Additionally, we have introduced our Byte by Yum! platform, a comprehensive collection of proprietary software as a service and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") driven products that enables easy operations for team members and improved experiences for customers, while consolidating essential systems into a cohesive, easy-to-manage platform. The Byte by Yum! platform includes online and mobile app ordering, point of sale, kitchen and delivery optimization, menu management, inventory and labor management and team member tools. The implementation of Byte by Yum! is also designed to enable a faster and more impactful adoption of AI by YUM and its brands, and offers franchisees leading technology capabilities with advantaged economics made possible by the scale of YUM all with a goal of unlocking new insights and driving profitable sales growth. \nDigital sales include transactions where consumers at system restaurants utilize ordering interaction that is primarily facilitated by automated technology. In 2024, our system restaurants generated digital sales of $33 billion, representing over 50% of overall system sales.\nThe Company and its Concepts own numerous registered trademarks. The Company believes that many of these marks, including our Kentucky Fried Chicken®, KFC®, Taco Bell®, Pizza Hut® and The Habit® marks, have significant value and material importance to our business. The Company’s policy is to pursue registration of important marks whenever feasible and to challenge any infringement of our marks vigorously. The use of certain of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements. Under current law and with proper use, the Company’s rights in our marks can generally last indefinitely. The Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment and technology which, while valuable, are not currently considered material to our business.\n5\nSupply\n \nand Distribution\nThe Company and franchisees of the Concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include chicken, cheese, beef and pork products, paper and packaging materials. Prices paid for these supplies fluctuate. When prices increase, the Concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers, although there is no assurance that this can be done in practice.  The Company does not typically experience significant continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these supplies are generally available.  \nIn the U.S., the Company, along with the representatives of the Company’s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchisee groups, are members of Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions, LLC (“RSCS”), a third party which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment. Additionally, Habit Burger & Grill entered into a purchasing agreement with RSCS effective July 31, 2020. The core mission of RSCS is to provide the lowest possible sustainable store-delivered prices for restaurant products and equipment.  This arrangement combines the purchasing power of the Company-owned and franchisee restaurants, which the Company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function. The Company also believes that RSCS fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with our franchisee community.\nMost food products, paper and packaging supplies, and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by third-party distribution companies. In the U.S., McLane Foodservice, Inc. is the distributor for the majority of items used in Company-owned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee restaurants.  Outside the U.S., we and our Concepts’ franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global, regional and local suppliers and distributors. Our international franchisees generally select and manage their own third-party suppliers and distributors, subject to our internal standards. All suppliers and distributors are expected to provide products and/or services that comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the state and/or country in which they operate as well as comply with our internal standards.\nAdvertising and Promotional Programs\nCompany-owned and franchise restaurants are required to spend a percentage of their respective restaurants’ sales on advertising programs with the goal of increasing sales and enhancing the reputation of the Concepts. Advertising may be conducted nationally, regionally and locally. When multiple franchisees operate in the same country or region, the national and regional advertising spending is typically conducted by a cooperative to which the franchisees and Company-owned restaurants, if any, contribute funds as a percentage of restaurants’ sales. The contributions are primarily used to pay for expenses relating to purchasing media for advertising, market research, commercial production, talent payments and other support functions for the respective Concepts. We have the right to control the advertising activities of certain advertising cooperatives, typically in markets where we have Company-owned restaurants, through our majority voting rights.\nWorking Capital\nInformation about the Company’s working capital is included in MD&A in Part II, Item 7 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8.\nSeasonal Operations\nThe Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.\n6\nCompetition\nThe retail food industry, in which our Concepts compete, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including those in the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, digital engagement, advertising levels and promotional initiatives, customer service reputation, restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties. Competition has also increased from and been enabled by delivery aggregators and other food delivery services in recent years, particularly in urbanized areas. Our Concepts also face competition as a result of convergence in grocery, convenience, deli and restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals, including pizzas and entrees with side dishes. The retail food industry is often affected by: changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power. Within the retail food industry, each of our Concepts competes with international, national and regional chains as well as locally-owned establishments, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.  Given the various types and vast number of competitors, our Concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales, either on a worldwide or individual country basis.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company is not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures. However, the Company cannot predict the effect on our operations due to possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During 2024, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.\nGovernment Regulation\nU.S. Operations.\n \n \nThe Company and its U.S. operations, as well as our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business, including laws and regulations concerning information security, privacy, labor and employment, health, marketing, food labeling, competition, public accommodation, sanitation and safety. Each of our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurants in the U.S. must comply with licensing requirements and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety, fire and zoning agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. In addition, each Concept must comply with various state and federal laws that regulate the franchisor/franchisee relationship. To date, the Company has not been materially adversely affected by such licensing requirements and regulations or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.\nInternational Operations\n.\n  Our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to national and local laws and regulations which have similarities to those affecting U.S. restaurants but may differ among jurisdictions. Like restaurants in the U.S., restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to certain regulations and tariffs on imported commodities and equipment, laws regulating foreign investment and anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.  \nSee Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 40,000 persons (collectively referred to throughout this filing as \"our employees\" or \"YUM employees\"), including approximately 23,000 employees in the U.S. and approximately 17,000 employees outside the U.S. Approximately 85% of our employees work in restaurants while the remainder work in our restaurant-support centers. In the U.S., approximately 85% of our Company-owned restaurant employees are part-time and approximately 40% have been employed by the Company for less than a year. Some of our International employees are subject to labor council relationships whose terms vary due to the diverse countries in which the Company operates.\nIn addition to the persons employed by the Company and its subsidiaries, our approximately 60,000 franchise restaurants around the world are responsible for the employment of over an estimated 1 million people who work in and support those restaurants. Each year YUM and our franchisees around the world create thousands of restaurant jobs, which are part-time, entry-level opportunities to grow careers at our KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger & Grill brands. As evidence of the opportunities these positions create, approximately 80% of the Company-owned Restaurant General Managers (“RGMs”) \n7\nlocated in the U.S. have been promoted from other positions in our brands’ restaurants and such RGMs often earn pay greater than the average American household income.\nHuman capital management considerations are integral to our Recipe for Good Growth strategy, the drivers of which include leveraging our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success, as well as recruiting and equipping the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences. Our investment in people includes creating a culture of engagement that attracts, retains and grows the best people and creates high performance in our restaurants. We are also highly focused on building an inclusive culture among our employees, franchisees, suppliers and partners that reflects all of our customers and communities, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage with respect to the performance of our business. Our commitments and progress towards our vision of culture, opportunity and belonging are reflected below.\n•\nContinually building upon ongoing inclusion efforts to help ensure our workplaces are environments where all people can be successful.  \n•\nConsistent with our Code of Conduct, making employment-related decisions based on an individual's abilities and merit, not personal characteristics that are unrelated to the job.\n•\nMeasuring YUM employee engagement regularly. For example, every other year we conduct a global employee engagement survey of all employees working in our restaurant support centers. The most recent survey conducted was in 2023 and reflected an engagement level among our employees significantly exceeding the average engagement levels of benchmarked companies. \n•\nProviding YUM employees with training and development that builds world-class leaders and drives business results.\n•\nEnabling a culture that fuels results and cross-brand collaboration on operational execution, people capability and customer experience initiatives throughout our system.\n•\nAssessing progress towards lowering turnover and increasing retention rates, particularly at the restaurant-employee level.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company makes available, through the Investor Relations section of its internet website at \nhttps://www.yum.com,\n its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) at \nhttps://www.sec.gov\n.   \nOur Corporate Governance Principles and our Code of Conduct are also located within the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website.

  "item7": "Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction and Overview\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Financial Statements”) in Item 8 and the Forward-Looking Statements and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions of U.S. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Percentages may not recompute due to rounding.\nYum! Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as the “Company”, “YUM”, “we”, “us” or “our”) franchise or operate a system of over 61,000 restaurants in more than 155 countries and territories, primarily under the concepts of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger & Grill (collectively, the “Concepts”). The Company’s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands are global leaders of the chicken, Mexican-style food and pizza categories, respectively. The Habit Burger & Grill is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. Of the over 61,000 restaurants, 98% are operated by franchisees.\nAs of December 31, 2024, YUM consists of four operating segments:\n•\nThe KFC Division which includes our worldwide operations of the KFC concept \n•\nThe Taco Bell Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Taco Bell concept \n•\nThe Pizza Hut Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Pizza Hut concept\n•\nThe Habit Burger & Grill Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Habit Burger & Grill concept\nThrough our Recipe for Good Growth we intend to deliver iconic restaurant brands and consistently drive better customer experiences, improved unit economics and higher rates of growth. Key enablers include accelerated use of digital and technology, increased collaboration and better leverage of our systemwide scale. This is done through a framework of three pillars: being Loved, Trusted and Connected.\nLoved: We grow by delighting customers with craveable food and a distinctive experience. We innovate and elevate our iconic restaurant brands that people trust and champion, resulting in relevant, easy and distinctive brands.\nTrusted: We operate responsibly with consistency and efficiency in our restaurants, across our system and in our communities. This includes a commitment to our priorities for social responsibility, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and planet.\nConnected: We use our teamwork, technology and global scale to serve every customer, everywhere, anytime. Our unmatched operating capability allows us to recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences. And our commitment to bold restaurant development drives market and franchise unit expansion with strong economics. \nOur unrivaled culture and talent and leading with smart, heart and courage are key to our success, fueling brand performance and franchise success. \nWe intend to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns primarily through consistent same-store sales growth and new unit development across all of our Concepts. We intend to support this growth and development through a capital and operating structure that:\n•\nInvests capital in a manner consistent with an asset light, franchisor model; \n•\nAllocates G&A in an efficient manner that provides leverage to operating profit growth while at the same time opportunistically investing in strategic growth initiatives;\n•\nTargets a consolidated net leverage ratio that balances shareholder returns, cost of capital and flexibility against various risk factors; and\n•\nMaximizes shareholder return through a combination of paying a competitive dividend and returning excess free cash flow through share repurchases.\n30\nWe intend for this MD&A to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company’s performance. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following performance metrics:\n•\nSame-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in system sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the YUM system for one year or more, including those temporarily closed. From time-to-time restaurants may be temporarily closed due to remodeling or image enhancement, rebuilding, natural disasters, health epidemic or pandemic, landlord disputes, boycotts, social or civil unrest or other issues. The system sales of restaurants we deem temporarily closed remain in our base for purposes of determining same-store sales growth and the restaurants remain in our unit count (see below). Same-store sales growth excludes, for subsidiaries operating on a monthly calendar, the extra day resulting from a leap year and excludes, for subsidiaries operating on a weekly periodic calendar, the last week of the year in fiscal years with 53 weeks. We believe same-store sales growth is useful to investors because our results are heavily dependent on the results of our Concepts' existing store base.  Additionally, same-store sales growth is reflective of the strength of our Brands, the effectiveness of our operational and advertising initiatives and local economic and consumer trends.  \n•\nGross unit openings reflects new openings by us and our franchisees. Net new unit growth reflects gross unit openings offset by permanent store closures, by us and our franchisees. To determine whether a restaurant meets the definition of a unit we consider factors such as whether the restaurant has operations that are ongoing and independent from another YUM unit, serves the primary product of one of our Concepts, operates under a separate franchise agreement (if operated by a franchisee) and has substantial and sustainable sales. We believe gross unit openings and net new unit growth are useful to investors because we depend on new units for a significant portion of our growth. Additionally, gross unit openings and net new unit growth are generally reflective of the economic returns to us and our franchisees from opening and operating our Concept restaurants.\n•\nSystem sales, System sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation (“FX”) and, in 2024, System sales excluding FX and the 53rd week for our U.S. subsidiaries and certain international subsidiaries that operate on a weekly periodic calendar, reflect the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned and franchise restaurants. Sales at franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the Company at a rate of 3% to 6% of sales. Increasingly, customers are paying a fee to a third party to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our Concepts’ products. We also include in System sales any portion of the amount customers pay these third parties for which the third party is obligated to pay us a license fee as a percentage of such amount. Franchise restaurant sales and fees paid by customers to third parties to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our Concepts’ products are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, any resulting franchise and license fees we receive are included in the Company’s revenues. We believe System sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates our primary revenue drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net new unit growth.\nAs of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, as a result of our progress towards exiting Russia and our decision to reclass future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion of Ukraine from the Division segments in which those profits were earned to Unallocated Other income (see Notes 3 and 19), we elected to remove all Russia units from our unit count as well as to begin excluding those units’ associated sales from our system sales totals. We removed 1,112 units and 53 units in Russia from our global KFC and Pizza Hut unit counts, respectively. These units were treated similar to permanent store closures for purposes of our same-store sales calculations and thus they were removed from our same-store sales calculations beginning April 1, 2022. \nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company provides the following non-GAAP measurements. \n•\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\") excluding Special Items (as defined below) and, in 2024, Diluted EPS excluding Special Items and the 53rd week;\n•\nEffective Tax Rate excluding Special Items and, in 2024, Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items and the 53rd week; \n•\nCore Operating Profit and, in 2024, Core Operating Profit excluding the 53rd week. Core Operating Profit excludes Special Items and FX and we use Core Operating Profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally;\n•\nNet Income excluding Special Items and, in 2024, Net Income excluding Special Items and the 53rd week;\n•\nCompany restaurant profit and Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales (as defined below).\n31\nThese non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.\nSpecial Items are not included in any of our Division segment results as the Company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.  Our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of Special Items when assessing segment performance.\nCompany restaurant profit is defined as Company sales less Company restaurant expenses, both of which appear on the face of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Company restaurant expenses include those expenses incurred directly by our Company-owned restaurants in generating Company sales, including cost of food and paper, cost of restaurant-level labor, rent, depreciation and amortization of restaurant-level assets and advertising expenses incurred by and on behalf of that Company restaurant. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales (“Company restaurant margin %”) is defined as Company restaurant profit divided by Company sales. We use Company restaurant profit for the purposes of internally evaluating the performance of our Company-owned restaurants and we believe Company restaurant profit provides useful information to investors as to the profitability of our Company-owned restaurants. In calculating Company restaurant profit, the Company excludes revenues and expenses directly associated with our franchise operations as well as non-restaurant-level costs included in General and administrative expenses, some of which may support Company-owned restaurant operations. The Company also excludes restaurant-level asset impairment and closures expenses, which have historically not been significant, from the determination of Company restaurant profit as such expenses are not believed to be indicative of ongoing operations. Further, while we generally include depreciation and amortization of restaurant-level assets within Divisional Company restaurant expenses used to derive Divisional Company restaurant profit, we record amortization of reacquired franchise rights arising from acquisition accounting within Corporate and unallocated Company restaurant expenses as such amortization is not believed to be indicative of ongoing Divisional results as well as to enhance comparability of acquired stores’ margins with those of existing restaurants within Divisional results. Company restaurant profit and Company restaurant margin % as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry.\nCertain performance metrics and non-GAAP measurements are presented excluding the impact of FX. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the FX impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.\nFor 2024 we provided System sales excluding FX and the 53rd week, Core Operating Profit excluding the 53rd week, Net Income excluding Special Items and the 53rd week,  Diluted EPS excluding Special Items and the 53rd week and Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items and the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2024.\nResults of Operations\nSummary\nAll comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded net refranchising losses of $1 million and $5 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items.\nAdditionally, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net refranchising gains of $35 million, $34 million and $27 million, respectively, that have not been reflected as Special Items. These net refranchising gains relate to refranchising of restaurants unrelated to market-wide refranchisings that we believe are indicative of our expected ongoing refranchising activity.\n(b)\nIn the first quarter of 2022, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia. We also suspended all operations of our 70 company-owned KFC restaurants in Russia and began finalizing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut operations in Russia, in partnership with our master franchisee. Further, we pledged to redirect any future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion to humanitarian efforts. During the second quarter of 2022, we completed the transfer of ownership of the Pizza Hut Russia business to a local operator. In April 2023, we completed our exit from the Russia market by selling the KFC business in Russia to Smart Service Ltd.\nOur GAAP operating results presented herein reflect revenues from and expenses to support the Russian operations for KFC and Pizza Hut prior to the dates of sale or transfer, within their historical financial statement line items and operating segments. However, given our decision to exit Russia and our pledge to direct any future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion to humanitarian efforts, we reclassed such net operating profits or losses from the Division segment results in which they were earned to Unallocated Other income (expense). Additionally, we incurred certain expenses related to the dispositions of the businesses and other one-time costs related to our exit from Russia which we recorded within Corporate and unallocated G&A and Unallocated Franchise and property expenses. Also recorded in Unallocated Other income (expense) were foreign exchange impacts attributable to fluctuations in the value of the Russian ruble and a charge of $3 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of the completion of the sale of the KFC Russia business. The resulting net Operating Loss of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and net Operating Profit of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, have been reflected as Special Items.\n(c)\nCharges related to a resource optimization program initiated in the third quarter of 2020. See Note 5. Due to their scope and size, the charges over the life of the program, which have primarily resulted from severance associated with positions that have been eliminated or relocated and consultant fees, are being recorded within Corporate and unallocated G&A and have been reflected as Special Items.\n(d)\nOn January 8, 2025, we terminated our franchise agreements with franchisee IS Gida A.S. (IS Gida), the owner and operator of KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in Turkey and a subsidiary of IS Holding A.S. (IS Holding), after failure by IS Gida to meet our standards. The termination affects 284 KFC restaurants and 254 Pizza Hut restaurants in Turkey. We also re-acquired the master franchise rights in Germany for KFC and Pizza Hut from the owner of IS Holding in December 2024. There is no impact in Germany from the termination in Turkey. As a result, we recorded charges of $37 million to Unallocated Other (income) expense, $18 million to Unallocated Franchise and property revenues and $6 million to Corporate and unallocated General and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs associated with the German acquisition and termination-related costs associated with the Turkey business in the year ended December 31, 2024, that have been reflected as Special Items.\n(e)\nAmounts recorded in connection with redemptions of long-term debt. See Note 5. Due to their size and the fact that they are not indicative of our ongoing interest expense, these amounts have been reflected as Special Items. \n(f)\nThe below table includes the detail of Special Items Tax (Benefit) Expense:\n38\nYear\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTax (Benefit) Expense on Special Items Operating Profit and Interest Expense\n$\n(28)\n$\n(8)\n$\n2 \nTax (Benefit) Expense - Other Income tax impacts from decision to exit Russia\n— \n(7)\n72 \nTax (Benefit) - Intra-entity transfers and valuations of intellectual property\n(32)\n(183)\n(82)\nTax (Benefit) Expense - Other Income tax impacts recorded as Special\n(6)\n37 \n— \nSpecial Items Tax (Benefit) Expense\n$\n(66)\n$\n(161)\n$\n(8)\nTax (Benefit) Expense on Special Items Operating Profit and Interest Expense was determined by assessing the tax impact of each individual component within Special Items based upon the nature of the item and jurisdictional tax law.  \nIn addition to the corresponding Tax (Benefit) Expense on the Operating (Profit) Loss impact from our decision to exit Russia as included above, Special Items Tax (Benefit) Expense also includes $72 million of incremental net tax expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022 from the remeasurement and reassessment of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Switzerland due to the expected reduction in the tax basis of intellectual property rights (\"IP\") associated with the loss of the Russian royalty income. In addition, we reassessed certain deferred tax liabilities associated with the Russia business given the expectation that the existing basis difference would reverse by way of sale.\nSpecial Items Tax (Benefit) Expense includes $32 million, $183 million and $82 million of tax benefit recorded in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively, associated with intra-entity transfers and valuations of certain IP rights. \n•\nThe benefit recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024, resulted primarily from the tax liquidation of certain subsidiaries in Israel and Australia as well as the intra-entity transfer of software from those subsidiaries to subsidiaries in the U.S.\n•\nThe benefit recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted primarily from $99 million of deferred tax benefit arising from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets associated with previously transferred IP rights in Switzerland as a result of an increase in our jurisdictional tax rate, as well as a $29 million deferred tax benefit associated with credits granted by local Swiss tax authorities. The benefit recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023, also includes $30 million of deferred tax benefit associated with the intra-entity transfer of certain Asia region IP rights to Singapore or the U.S. \n•\nThe benefit recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets associated with IP rights held in Switzerland in connection with an annual valuation under Swiss law, as well as the reassessment of the need for a valuation allowance on those deferred tax assets based on forecasted future taxable income. The annual valuation supported an increase to tax basis of Swiss IP rights associated with parts of our business that continue to use these IP rights due to expected royalty growth assumptions in those parts of the business that largely offset the loss of Russia royalty income associated with such IP rights as a result of our decision to exit the Russia market.\nOther Income Tax impacts recorded as Special in the year ended December 31, 2023 included $41 million of expense associated with a correction in the timing of capital loss utilization related to refranchising gains previously recorded as Special Items to tax years with a lower statutory tax rate. \n39\nReconciliation of GAAP Operating Profit to Company Restaurant Profit\n2024\nKFC Division\nTaco Bell Division\nPizza Hut Division\nHabit Burger & Grill Division\nCorporate and Unallocated\nConsolidated\nGAAP Operating Profit (Loss)\n$\n1,363 \n$\n1,049 \n$\n373 \n$\n— \n$\n(382)\n$\n2,403 \nLess:\nFranchise and property revenues\n1,685 \n997 \n622 \n9 \n(18)\n3,295 \nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services\n613 \n708 \n378 \n3 \n— \n1,702 \nAdd:\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n363 \n199 \n219 \n54 \n346 \n1,181 \nFranchise and property expenses\n63 \n33 \n34 \n4 \n— \n134 \nFranchise advertising and other services expense\n610 \n708 \n390 \n3 \n— \n1,711 \nRefranchising (gain) loss\n— \n— \n— \n— \n(34)\n(34)\nOther (income) expense\n(3)\n(1)\n(16)\n10 \n44 \n34 \nCompany restaurant profit (loss)\n$\n98 \n$\n283 \n$\n— \n$\n59 \n(8)\n$\n432 \nCompany sales\n$\n801 \n$\n1,155 \n$\n8 \n$\n588 \n— \n$\n2,552 \nCompany restaurant margin % \n12.2 \n%\n24.4 \n%\n(0.6)\n%\n10.1 \n%\nN/A\n16.9 \n%\n2023\nKFC Division\nTaco Bell Division\nPizza Hut Division\nHabit Burger &  Grill Division\nCorporate and Unallocated\nConsolidated\nGAAP Operating Profit (Loss)\n$\n1,304 \n$\n944 \n$\n391 \n$\n(14)\n$\n(307)\n$\n2,318 \nLess:\nFranchise and property revenues\n1,698 \n918 \n622 \n9 \n— \n3,247 \nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services\n648 \n654 \n383 \n2 \n— \n1,687 \nAdd:\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n383 \n204 \n221 \n59 \n326 \n1,193 \nFranchise and property expenses\n72 \n32 \n15 \n3 \n1 \n123 \nFranchise advertising and other services expense\n648 \n644 \n389 \n2 \n— \n1,683 \nRefranchising (gain) loss\n— \n— \n— \n— \n(29)\n(29)\nOther (income) expense\n6 \n— \n(11)\n10 \n9 \n14 \nCompany restaurant profit\n$\n67 \n$\n252 \n$\n— \n$\n49 \n$\n— \n$\n368 \nCompany sales\n$\n484 \n$\n1,069 \n$\n14 \n$\n575 \n$\n— \n$\n2,142 \nCompany restaurant margin % \n13.7 \n%\n23.7 \n%\n0.1 \n%\n8.5 \n%\nN/A\n17.2 \n%\n40\n2022\nKFC Division\nTaco Bell Division\nPizza Hut Division\nHabit Burger & Grill Division\nCorporate and Unallocated\nConsolidated\nGAAP Operating Profit (Loss)\n$\n1,198 \n$\n850 \n$\n387 \n$\n(24)\n$\n(224)\n$\n2,187 \nLess:\nFranchise and property revenues\n1,645 \n837 \n607 \n7 \n— \n3,096 \nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services\n698 \n598 \n376 \n2 \n— \n1,674 \nAdd:\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n390 \n191 \n211 \n51 \n297 \n1,140 \nFranchise and property expenses\n69 \n33 \n13 \n2 \n6 \n123 \nFranchise advertising and other services expense\n684 \n599 \n382 \n2 \n— \n1,667 \nRefranchising (gain) loss\n— \n— \n— \n— \n(27)\n(27)\nOther (income) expense\n67 \n(2)\n(10)\n4 \n(52)\n7 \nCompany restaurant profit\n$\n65 \n$\n236 \n$\n— \n$\n26 \n$\n— \n$\n327 \nCompany sales\n$\n491 \n$\n1,002 \n$\n21 \n$\n558 \n$\n— \n$\n2,072 \nCompany restaurant margin % \n13.2 \n%\n23.6 \n%\n(2.2)\n%\n4.7 \n%\nN/A\n15.8 \n%\nItems Impacting Reported Results and/or Reasonably Likely to Impact Future Results\nThe following items impacted reported results in 2024 and/or 2023 and/or are reasonably likely to impact future results.

Our sales continued to be impacted during 2024, most significantly in markets across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. The impact in these markets represented an approximate one-point headwind to YUM's overall same-store sales growth in the year ended December 31, 2024. Additionally, we believe we experienced conflict-related impacts in a broader set of markets and trade areas, though such amounts are difficult to precisely quantify.\nIn a few isolated cases, the scale and duration of these sales impacts have affected the financial health of our less scaled or less well-capitalized franchisees, particularly those whose restaurants have been most heavily impacted. On January 8, 2025, we terminated our franchise agreements with franchisee IS Gida A.S. (IS Gida), the owner and operator of KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in Turkey and a subsidiary of IS Holding A.S. (IS Holding), after failure by IS Gida to meet our standards. The termination affects 284 KFC restaurants and 254 Pizza Hut restaurants in Turkey, which will be reflected as a reduction in the Company’s reported unit counts at the end of the first quarter of 2025. We also re-acquired the master franchise rights in Germany for KFC and Pizza Hut from the owner of IS Holding in December 2024. There is no impact in Germany from the termination in Turkey. We recorded a charge of approximately $61 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, consisting primarily of transaction costs associated with the German acquisition and termination-related costs associated with the Turkey business. Due to issues specific to this franchisee and market, the recent sales in the Turkey restaurants were significantly below the global average sales per restaurant for each brand. As a result, the loss of royalties from the store closures will have no material impact to the Company’s Core Operating Profit in 2025 and beyond. We are actively searching for the right franchise partner to reopen the Turkey market and drive future success. \nWhile we began to see some recovery in the markets most impacted by the Middle East conflict in the fourth quarter of 2024, the conflict is ongoing, and its dynamic nature makes it difficult to forecast any impacts on the Company’s 2025 revenues, operating profit, including the impacts of any bad debt expense, and unit count with any certainty.\nInvestment in Devyani \nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we sold our approximate 5% minority investment in Devyani International Limited (\"Devyani\"), a franchise entity that operates KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in India, for pre-tax proceeds of $\n104\n million. Changes in the fair value of our ownership interest in Devyani prior to the date of sale resulted in pre-tax investment losses of $\n20\n million in the year ended December 31, 2024 and pre-tax investment income of $\n8\n million and $\n11\n million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nKFC Division\nThe KFC Division has 31,981 units, 89% of which are located outside the U.S.  Additionally, 99% of the KFC Division units were operated by franchisees as of the end of 2024.\n42\n% B/(W)\n% B/(W)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nReported\nEx FX\nEx FX and 53rd Week in

The change was primarily driven by outflows in the current year related to the KFC U.K. and Ireland restaurant acquisition, lapping proceeds from the prior year sale of KFC Russia and current year purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by current year proceeds arising from the sale of our approximate 5% minority investment in Devyani.\nNet cash used in financing activities \nwas $1,163 million in 2024 versus $1,429 million in 2023. The change was primarily driven by net borrowings in the current year as compared to net debt repayments in the prior year, partially offset by higher current year share repurchases.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically generated substantial cash flows from our extensive franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment, and from the operations of our Company-owned stores. Our annual operating cash flows have been in excess of $1.4 billion in each of the past four years and we expect that to continue to be the case in 2025.  It is our intent to use these operating cash flows to continue to invest in growing our business and pay a competitive dividend, with any remaining excess then returned to shareholders through share repurchases. Subject to market conditions, we expect to maintain our consolidated net leverage ratio at its current level of approximately 4.0x Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") over the medium term by issuing incremental debt as our business grows. As a result, we plan to deliver materially higher capital returns going forward as compared to the past two years when we were using significant amounts of excess cash to reduce our debt outstanding. \nTo the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash do not cover our anticipated cash needs, we maintain a $1.5 billion Revolving Facility under our Credit Agreement (see Note 11) which had $350 million outstanding as of December 31, 2024. We believe that our ongoing cash from operations, cash on hand, which was approximately $600 million at December 31, 2024, and availability under our Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements over the next twelve months. Borrowings under our Revolving Facility in 2024 had original maturities of three months or less.\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 96%, including the impact of interest rate swaps, of our $11.0 billion of total debt outstanding, excluding the Revolving Facility balance, finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts, is fixed with an effective overall interest rate of approximately 4.5%. We target a capital structure which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates, duration and flexibility with diversified sources of liquidity and maturities spread over multiple years, and as mentioned above, we expect to maintain our net leverage ratio at approximately 4.0x EBITDA over the medium term by issuing incremental debt as our business grows. We currently have credit ratings of BB (Standard & Poor’s)/Ba2 (Moody’s). \n47\nThe following table summarizes the future maturities of our outstanding long-term debt, excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts, as of December 31, 2024.\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2037\n2043\nTotal\nSecuritization Notes\n$\n938 \n$\n884 \n$\n595 \n$\n589 \n$\n737 \n$\n3,743 \nCredit Agreement\n$\n21 \n27 \n34 \n1,424 \n438 \n1,944 \nRevolving Facility\n350\n350 \nSubsidiary Senior Unsecured Notes\n750 \n750 \nYUM Senior Unsecured Notes\n$\n800 \n1,050 \n$\n2,100 \n$\n325 \n$\n275 \n4,550 \nTotal\n$\n21 \n$\n965 \n$\n1,668 \n$\n2,019 \n$\n1,377 \n$\n800 \n$\n1,787 \n$\n2,100 \n$\n325 \n$\n275 \n$\n11,337 \nInterest payments on the outstanding long-term debt in the table above total approximately $2.7 billion, with approximately $500 million due within the next twelve months on the outstanding amounts on a nominal basis. The estimated interest payments related to the variable rate portion of our debt, net of our interest rate swaps, are based on current Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) interest rates.\nSee Note 11 for details on the Securitization Notes, the Credit Agreement, Subsidiary Senior Unsecured Notes and YUM Senior Unsecured Notes.\nOperating and Finance Leases\nPayments required under our operating and finance leases total $1,355 million, of which $148 million is payable within the next 12 months. These amounts are on a nominal basis and include payments related to lease renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. These leases relate primarily to approximately 950 Company-owned restaurants and approximately 200 leased restaurants for which we sublease land, building or both to our franchisees.  See Note 12.\nInvesting Activities\nWe remain committed to maintaining our asset light, franchisor model that includes at least a 98% franchise mix. Our allocation strategy for investing activities includes:\n•\nRun-rate capital expenditures consisting of company restaurant repairs, maintenance and remodels, support of our digital and technology initiatives and project-specific capital expenditures,\n•\nTargeted new company unit development to spur additional growth that is partially funded through refranchising a comparable number of existing company units, and\n•\nStrategic investments that create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees.\nIn 2025, we expect gross capital expenditures of approximately $350 million driven by technology initiatives and continued investments in Taco Bell, Habit Burger & Grill and KFC company restaurants. Additionally, we expect approximately $55 million of refranchising proceeds, resulting in net capital expenditures\n \nof approximately $295 million. \nPurchase Obligations\nOur purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancellable without penalty. Our purchase obligations relate primarily to marketing, information technology and supply agreements. We have purchase obligations of approximately $525 million at December 31, 2024, with approximately $325 million due within the next 12 months.\nIn addition to our contractual and other obligations, we seek to pay a competitive dividend and return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. As discussed in Note 20, we are also subject to claims and contingencies related to certain tax and legal matters that may require future cash outlays. \n48\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nIn February 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.71 per share of Common Stock, a 6% increase from the quarterly dividend of $0.67 per share of Common Stock paid in 2024. This quarterly dividend will be distributed March 7, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2025, and will total approximately $200 million.\nIn May 2024, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $2 billion (excluding applicable transaction fees and excise taxes) of our outstanding Common Stock through December 31, 2026. This authorization took effect on July 1, 2024 upon the exhaustion of a prior authorization approved in September 2022. As of December 31, 2024, we have remaining capacity to repurchase up to $1.6 billion of Common Stock under this authorization. This authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. \nContingencies\nAs discussed in Note 20, as a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, in August 2022, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) from the IRS asserting an underpayment of tax of $2.1 billion plus $418 million in penalties for the 2014 fiscal year. Additionally, interest on the underpayment is estimated to be approximately $1.4 billion through December 31, 2024. The proposed underpayment relates primarily to a series of reorganizations we undertook during that year in connection with the business realignment of our corporate and management reporting structure along brand lines. The IRS asserts that these transactions resulted in taxable distributions of approximately $6.0 billion. \nWe disagree with the IRS’s position as asserted in the RAR and intend to contest that position vigorously. In September 2022, we filed a Protest with the IRS Examination Division disputing on multiple grounds the proposed underpayment of tax and penalties. We\n have received the IRS Examination Division’s Rebuttal to our Protest and the matter is proceeding with the IRS Office of Appeals.\nAlso, as discussed in Note 20, on January 29, 2020, we received an order from the Special Director of the Directorate of Enforcement (“DOE”) in India imposing a penalty on Yum! Restaurants India Private Limited (“YRIPL”) of approximately Indian Rupee 11 billion, or approximately $130 million, primarily relating to alleged violations of operating conditions imposed in 1993 and 1994. We have been advised by external counsel that the order is flawed and have filed a writ petition with the Delhi High Court, which granted an interim stay of the penalty order on March 5, 2020. In November 2022, YRIPL was notified that an administrative tribunal bench had been constituted to hear an appeal by DOE of certain findings of the January 2020 order, including claims that certain charges had been wrongly dropped and that an insufficient amount of penalty had been imposed. A hearing with the administrative tribunal has been rescheduled to March 18, 2025. The stay order remains in effect, and the next in the Delhi High Court has been rescheduled to April 29, 2025. We deny liability and intend to continue vigorously defending this matter. \nSee the Lease Guarantees section of Note 20 for discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which updates income tax disclosure requirements related to the income tax rate reconciliation and requires disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The standard is effective for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2025. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our disclosures. \nIn March 2024, the SEC issued a final rule under SEC Release Nos. 33-11275 and 34-99678, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. The rule requires disclosure of material climate-related information outside of the audited financial statements and disclosure in the footnotes addressing specified financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions above certain financial thresholds, certain carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates. The standard is effective for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2025. In April 2024, the SEC released an order staying this final rule pending judicial review of all the petitions challenging the rule. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of the rule on our disclosures should the stay be lifted.\n49\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40), which requires new financial statement disclosures disaggregating prescribed expense categories within relevant income statement expense captions. The standard is effective for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2027, and subsequent interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our disclosures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments.  These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition.  Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in future years.  A description of what we consider to be critical accounting policies follows.  \nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets of restaurants we intend to continue operating as Company restaurants (primarily PP&E, right-of-use operating lease assets and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization) annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. We use two consecutive years of operating losses as our primary indicator of potential impairment for our annual impairment testing of these restaurant assets.\n \nWe evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows, which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants.  For restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we write-down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value.  \nFair value is an estimate of the price a franchisee would pay for the restaurant and its related assets, including any right-of-use assets, and is determined by discounting the estimated future after-tax cash flows of the restaurant, which include a deduction for royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market. The after-tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant. \nWe perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level when it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group.  Expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer, if available, or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after-tax cash flows for the group of restaurants.  Historically, these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. The after-tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate similar assumptions to those of a restaurant level assessment.\nThe discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long-lived assets.  The discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.\nEstimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. We formulate these estimates in consideration of historical experience, recent economic and industry trends, and competitive conditions. If our estimates or underlying assumptions, including the discount rate, change, we may experience higher impairment charges in the future.\nWe evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future after-tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset. Our most significant indefinite-lived intangible asset is our Habit Burger & Grill brand asset with a book value of $96 million at December 31, 2024. As of our fourth quarter 2024 annual impairment testing date, the fair values of all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values and no impairment was recorded.\n50\nImpairment of Goodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values.  Our reporting units are our business units (which are aligned based on geography) in our KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger & Grill Divisions. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after-tax cash flows from franchise royalties and Company-owned restaurant operations, if any.  Future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit.  \nFuture cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth (from net new units or same-store sales growth) and margin improvement (for those reporting units which include Company-owned restaurant operations) assumptions that we believe a third-party buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit.  Any margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated with sales growth as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives. The discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. We believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.\nThe fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were in excess of their respective carrying values as of our fourth quarter 2024 goodwill testing date, with all but the Habit Burger & Grill reporting unit having fair values that were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values. As it relates to our Habit Burger & Grill reporting unit, which includes a goodwill balance of $66 million as of the end of 2024, the assumptions that are most impactful to our fair value estimate include margin improvement, sales growth from net new units and same-store sales growth. Significant changes in the assumptions used in our analysis could result in a future goodwill impairment charge. Circumstances that could result in changes to our assumptions and related fair value estimate include, but are not limited to, expectations of lower than originally estimated margin improvement, which can be caused by a variety of factors including changes in expected labor costs and commodity inflation. \nWhen we refranchise restaurants, we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.  The fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction. The fair value of the reporting unit retained is based on the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit retained and includes the value of franchise agreements. Appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreements are determined to not be at prevailing market rates. As such, the fair value of the reporting unit retained can include expected future cash flows from royalties from those restaurants currently being refranchised, royalties from existing franchise businesses and retained company restaurant operations.  As a result, the percentage of a reporting unit’s goodwill that will be written off in a refranchising transaction will be less than the percentage of the reporting unit’s Company-owned restaurants that are refranchised in that transaction and goodwill can be allocated to a reporting unit with only franchise restaurants. When determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world.  The Company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the Company and franchisee share in the impact of near-term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long-term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties.\nThe discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the Company.  The Company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising.  Others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit’s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction.\nDuring 2024, refranchising activity completed by the Company was limited and the write-off of goodwill associated with these transactions was less than $1 million.\n51\nPension Plans\nCertain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. Our two most significant plans are in the U.S. and combined had a projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) of $776 million and a fair value of plan assets of $644 million at December 31, 2024.\nThe PBO reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels.  Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBOs are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates.  For these U.S. plans, we measured our PBOs using a discount rate of 5.80% at December 31, 2024. The primary basis for this discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated Aa or higher by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans. We exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by Moody’s or S&P for a potential downgrade (if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below Aa by both Moody’s and S&P) and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one-year forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year. The weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. A 50 basis-point increase in this discount rate would have decreased these U.S. plans’ PBOs by approximately $40 million at our measurement date. Conversely, a 50 basis-point decrease in this discount rate would have increased these U.S. plans’ PBOs by approximately $40 million at our measurement date.\nThe net periodic benefit cost we will record in 2025 is also impacted by the discount rate, as well as the long-term rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date. We expect net periodic benefit income for these U.S. plans of $2 million in 2025 compared to $3 million of periodic benefit income in 2024, which represents a decrease in benefit of $1 million year-over-year.  A 50 basis-point change in our discount rate assumption at our 2024 measurement date would impact this 2025 U.S. net periodic benefit income by approximately $1 million. The impacts of changes in net periodic benefit income are reflected primarily in Other pension (income) expense.\nOur estimated long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is based upon the weighted-average of historical and expected future returns for each asset category. Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets, for purposes of determining 2025 pension expense, at December 31, 2024, was 6.85%, net of administrative and investment fees paid from plan assets.  We believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. A 100 basis point change in our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2025 U.S. net periodic benefit cost by approximately $8 million. Additionally, every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 6.85% will impact our unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss by approximately $8 million. \nWe have an unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss of $125 million included in Accumulated other comprehensive income for these U.S. plans at December 31, 2024. We will recognize approximately $2 million of this loss in 2025 versus $1 million of loss recognized in 2024.  \nIncome Taxes \nAt December 31, 2024, we had valuation allowances of $369 million to reduce our $1,768 million of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards in profitable U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions and net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions, the majority of which do not expire. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions, carryforward periods, restrictions on usage and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies and refranchising plans. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes.\nAs a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our Income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2024, we had $126 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $81 million of which would impact the effective income tax rate if recognized. We \n52\nevaluate unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures.\nRepatriation of earnings generated after December 31, 2017, will generally be eligible for the 100% dividends received deduction or considered a distribution of previously taxed income and, therefore, exempt from U.S. federal tax. Undistributed foreign earnings may still be subject to certain state and foreign income and withholding taxes upon repatriation. Subject to limited exceptions, we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our unremitted earnings outside the U.S. Thus, we have  provided taxes, including any U.S. federal and state income, foreign income, or foreign withholding taxes on the majority of our unremitted earnings. In jurisdictions where we do intend to indefinitely reinvest our unremitted earnings, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable income taxes (if any) and foreign withholding taxes if the funds were repatriated in taxable transactions. We believe any such taxes would be immaterial.",
