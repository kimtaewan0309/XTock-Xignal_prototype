Middleton does not have a contract growing program.\nHelix, through an affiliate, and NJOY purchase tobacco-derived nicotine materials from suppliers and believe their suppliers can satisfy current and anticipated future production requirements.\nOur tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements.\nOther Matters\n▪\nCustomers: \nFor a discussion of our largest customers, including their percentages of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, see Note 17.\n▪\nExecutive Officers of Altria: \nThe disclosure regarding executive officers is included in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance - \nInformation about Our Executive Officers as of February 14, 2025 \nof this Form 10-K.\n2\nTable of Contents\n▪\nHuman Capital Resources: \nWe believe our workforce is critical to achieving our Vision.  Attracting, developing, retaining and deploying the best talent with the skills to make significant progress toward our Vision is a key business priority.  Moreover, we recognize the importance of doing business the right way.  We believe culture influences employee actions and decision making.  This is why we dedicate resources to promoting a vibrant, inclusive workplace; attracting, developing, retaining and deploying talented employees to build a high-performing and diverse talent pipeline; promoting a culture of compliance and integrity; creating a safe workplace; and rewarding and recognizing employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them.\nOversight and Management\nOur Human Resources department is responsible for managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation and benefits design and implementation, performance management, career management and succession planning and professional and learning development.  Our inclusion, diversity and equity efforts are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department.  Our Board of Directors (“Board of Directors” or “Board”) and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development.\n“Supporting our People and our Communities” is one of our Responsibility Focus Areas, which includes two goals related to developing a high-performing and diverse talent pipeline: (i) enhance the diversity of our organization and leadership teams while building an inclusive and equitable culture; and (ii) build employee capability and well-being to succeed in uncertain and rapidly changing environments.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent.  However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent with skills necessary for us to achieve our Vision.  We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies with which we compete for talent.  Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements – base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits.\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies.  Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in 2024, for employees performing the same or similar duties regardless of any differentiating factors, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 98.2% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 98.2% of those of our white employees.  If we adjust for differentiating factors that legitimately influence pay, salaries of our female employees were 99.8% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance.  We also offer up to 12 weeks paid family leave to bond with a newborn child, the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for a family member who has a serious health condition.  Our benefits also include physical, emotional and financial wellness programs and family creation assistance benefits, such as reimbursement of surrogacy, adoption assistance and doula expenses.  While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through a tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees.  We also provide eligible employees with a company-funded contribution applied to the employee’s qualified higher education student loans to help reduce student loan debt.\nAttracting, Developing, Retaining and Deploying Talent\nWe are focused on identifying the most qualified talent and investing in leader and employee development to build a diverse talent pipeline prepared and willing to lead at every level.  Additionally, we are dedicated to being an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of personal background or work function.  We recognize the critical importance of these efforts toward pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad and diverse spectrum of backgrounds, skills, experiences and cultures.\nOur salaried entry-level recruitment efforts focus on building relationships with university students, internship opportunities and partnerships with organizations that support a broad range of students.  We complement these recruiting efforts with hiring experienced employees with demonstrated skills and/or leadership capabilities.\nTo help our employees succeed in their roles and develop in their careers, we emphasize ongoing training and leadership development opportunities.  Building skills that drive innovation and aligning our employees to our Vision is important for our long-term success.  The Human Resources department leads our learning and development efforts partnering with learning professionals embedded in functions throughout our operating and services companies.  Employees have access to a wide variety of development programs, including new employee onboarding, in-person, virtual and self-guided training programs, technical training, including training to maintain professional certifications, and our educational refund program for continuing education.\n3\nTable of Contents\nWe also have an employee recognition program that allows leaders and employees to reward and recognize colleagues for their outstanding performance and everyday excellence.\nWe regularly conduct confidential employee engagement surveys to seek feedback on a variety of topics, including employee satisfaction, support from leadership, corporate culture and culture of compliance.  In addition, in 2024, these quarterly employee surveys sought feedback on topics such as workplace flexibility, workload, inclusion, equal opportunity, development opportunities, management support, compliance and understanding of business strategy.  Survey results, including comparisons to prior results, are shared with our employees and our Board and are used to modify or enhance our human capital management programs.\nWe also monitor our progress toward building a diverse organization through various metrics, including comparisons to external benchmarks, and report workforce data annually.  Our data-driven efforts focus on removing barriers to equal opportunity in compliance with applicable law.\nWork Modernization\nAs part of our multi-phase \nOptimize & Accelerate\n initiative (“Initiative”), we plan to increase our organization’s speed, efficiency and effectiveness by centralizing work, outsourcing certain transactional tasks and streamlining, automating and standardizing processes.  Our Accelerated Business Solutions (“ABS”) organization will be responsible for driving efficiency and process improvement across our companies in partnership with external service providers.  We are implementing organizational design changes to support our enhanced business processes.  In addition, we are supporting the workforce with change management plans at the enterprise and function levels.  For additional information, see \nOur Business\n in Item 7.\nWorkplace Safety\nOur goal is for every employee to experience an injury-free career, which is supported by our Safety Management System (“SMS”).  We strive for continuous improvement in our employee safety program through SMS infrastructure.  Our Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable injury rate for 2024 was 1.8\n%\n (versus 1.2% for 2023) and remains below the benchmark for companies in the U.S. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing industry classification.\nNumber of Employees\n \nand Labor Relations\nAt December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 6,200 people.  Twenty-six percent of our employees were hourly manufacturing employees who are members of labor unions subject to collective bargaining agreements.  We believe we engage and collaborate effectively with our hourly employees, as demonstrated by the positive working relationship between our companies and the unions.  We also have long-term agreements that resolve any collective bargaining dispute through binding arbitration, which further demonstrates our trust-based relationship with the unions.\nSupply Chain Human Capital Matters\nWe support efforts to address human capital concerns in the tobacco supply chain.  For example, in our domestic tobacco supply chain, in 2024, all of our domestic tobacco growers participated in the Good Agricultural Practices Certification Program to assess growers’ compliance with practices related to labor management and all of our tobacco suppliers participated in the tobacco industry’s Sustainable Tobacco Program, which includes standards related to human and labor rights.  Our tobacco companies also establish contract terms and conditions with tobacco growers and leaf suppliers addressing child and forced labor and conduct social compliance audits at leaf supplier facilities in high-risk tobacco growing regions within the United States and internationally.  In addition, all suppliers of goods and services that maintain operations in high-risk countries are subject to social compliance audits of those operations.\nMore information about efforts discussed in this section can be found in our Corporate Responsibility Reports at www.altria.com/ under Responsibility.\n▪\nIntellectual Property: \nTrademarks are of material importance to us and are protected by registration or otherwise.  In addition, as of December 31, 2024, the portfolio of United States patents owned by our businesses, as a whole, was material to us and our businesses.  However, no one patent or group of related patents was material to our businesses as of December 31, 2024.  Our businesses also have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are protected by appropriate confidentiality measures.  Certain trade secrets are material to us and our businesses.\n▪\nGovernment Regulations: \nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations.  For example, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (“FSPTCA”) provides the FDA with broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations.  For further discussion of laws and regulations impacting our operating companies, see \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment \nin Item 7.\nWe and our subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as “Superfund”), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible \n4\nTable of Contents\nparty.  Altria and our former subsidiaries are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations.  Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations.  In the opinion of our management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\nFor further discussion of the foregoing matters, the business environment, trends in market demand and competitive conditions, and related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K (“Item 1A”) and \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n and \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment \nin Item 7.\nAvailable Information\nWe are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  The SEC maintains an Internet website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers from which investors can electronically access our SEC filings.\nWe make available free of charge on or through our website (www.altria.com) our Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, and the discussion of risk factors that may affect future results in Item 1A.  Additionally, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, which we filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024 and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\nIn this MD&A section, we refer to the following “adjusted” financial measures: adjusted operating companies income (loss) (“OCI”); adjusted OCI margins; adjusted net earnings; adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”); and adjusted effective tax rates.  We also refer to the ratio of debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in our credit agreement, which includes certain adjustments).  These financial measures are not required by, or calculated in accordance with, GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Our Vision is to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future.  We are \nMoving Beyond Smoking\nTM\n, leading the way in moving adult smokers away from cigarettes by taking action to transition millions to potentially less harmful choices - believing it is a substantial opportunity for adult tobacco consumers, our businesses and society.\nOur wholly owned subsidiaries include leading manufacturers of both combustible and smoke-free products.  In combustibles, we own PM USA, the most profitable U.S. cigarette manufacturer, and Middleton, a leading U.S. cigar manufacturer.\nIn smoke-free products, we own USSTC, the leading global MST manufacturer, Helix, a leading manufacturer of oral nicotine pouches, and NJOY, an e-vapor manufacturer with a commercialized product portfolio fully covered by MGOs from the FDA.  Additionally, we have a majority-owned joint venture, Horizon, for the U.S. marketing and commercialization of HTS products.\nThe brand portfolios of our operating companies include \nMarlboro\n, \nBlack & Mild\n, \nCopenhagen\n, \nSkoal\n, \non!\n and \nNJOY\n.  Trademarks related to Altria referenced in this Form 10-K are the property of Altria or our subsidiaries or are used with permission.\nOur investments in equity securities include ABI, the world’s largest brewer, and Cronos, a leading Canadian cannabinoid company.\n19\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nFor a description of Altria, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K (“Item 1”).\nVision and 2028 Goals\nAs we execute on our Vision, we established our 2028 Enterprise Goals (“2028 Goals”) to provide our investors with specific metrics to measure our progress.  Our 2028 Goals are:\n▪\nCorporate\n▪\nDeliver a mid-single digits adjusted diluted EPS compounded annual growth rate in 2028 from a $4.84 base in 2022 (for our progress through 2024, see \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n);\n▪\nA progressive dividend goal targeting mid-single digits dividend per share growth annually through 2028;\n▪\nTarget a debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.0x (see \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n);\n▪\nMaintain our leadership position in the U.S. tobacco space; and\n▪\nMaintain a total adjusted OCI margin of at least 60% in each year through 2028 (see \nOperating Results by Business Segment\n).\n▪\nU.S. Smoke-Free Portfolio\n▪\nGrow U.S. smoke-free volumes by at least 35% from our 2022 base of 800 million units by 2028 (see \nOperating Results by Business Segment\n); and\n▪\nApproximately double our U.S. smoke-free net revenues to $5 billion by 2028 from our 2022 base, with $2 billion sourced from innovative smoke-free products (see \nOperating Results by Business Segment\n).\nWe are reassessing our U.S. smoke-free goals due to the continued proliferation of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products resulting from insufficient enforcement action against manufacturers, distributors and retailers of these products.  We anticipate providing updated U.S. smoke-free goals when we have more clarity on how the legitimate e-vapor market may evolve.  For additional information on the e-vapor category, see \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment.\n▪\nLong-Term Growth\n▪\nCompete internationally in the top innovative oral tobacco markets and develop a pathway to participate in heated tobacco and e-vapor markets; and\n▪\nEnter non-nicotine categories with broad commercial distribution of at least five products by 2028.\nOptimize & Accelerate\n \nInitiative\nIn October 2024, we announced a multi-phase Initiative designed to modernize our ways of working as we work towards achieving our Vision and 2028 Goals.  Through the Initiative, we plan to increase our organization’s speed, efficiency and effectiveness by centralizing work, outsourcing certain transactional tasks and streamlining, automating and standardizing processes.  We expect the design and detailed plans for all phases of the Initiative to be substantially complete in early 2026.  As part of the Initiative, we established an ABS organization within ALCS.  This organization will be responsible for driving efficiency and process improvement across our companies in partnership with external service providers.\nWe expect the initial phases of the Initiative will deliver at least $600 million in cumulative cost savings over the next five years, which we plan to reinvest in our businesses in support of our Vision and 2028 Goals.  The cumulative cost savings exclude our estimated total pre-tax charges for the Initiative’s initial phases of approximately $100 million to $125 million, which we will treat as special items and exclude from our adjusted diluted EPS.  For further discussion of the Initiative, see Note 7. \nAsset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs \nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 7”).\nTrends and Developments\nIn this MD&A section, we discuss factors that have impacted our businesses as of the date of this Form 10-K.  In addition, we are aware of and address certain trends and developments that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on our businesses, including the value of our investments in equity securities, in the future.  We focus in this \nTrends and Developments \nsection on the discretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers, illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and recent regulatory and executive actions and their effects or potential effects on our businesses.\nU.S. adult tobacco consumers remained under pressure throughout 2024 largely due to the compounding effects of high prices exceeding overall wage growth and historically high levels of consumer credit and credit card delinquency rates.  Although inflation rates stabilized in 2024, increased prices continued to pressure adult tobacco consumers.  These pressures influenced the discount segment retail share growth within the cigarette industry year-over-year.  We will continue to monitor conditions that impact adult tobacco consumer discretionary income and overall purchasing behaviors, including overall tobacco product expenditures, mix between premium and discount brand purchases and adoption of smoke-free products.  We expect discretionary income pressures will continue to influence adult tobacco consumers’ purchase behaviors in 2025.\nProduct assortment, regulation and enforcement continue to evolve in the e-vapor category.  For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, we estimate the e-vapor category grew by approximately 30% versus the prior 12-month period, driven by the growth of illicit \n20\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nflavored disposable e-vapor products.  We estimate that illicit products now represent more than 60% of the e-vapor category.  In response to the proliferation of illicit disposable e-vapor products, states and the federal government took various regulatory and enforcement actions throughout the year in 2024, but these actions have failed to curb this trend.  Select states have established e-vapor product registries based on PMTA submissions or MGOs.  Additionally, we continue to see increased illicit activity across multiple tobacco categories, including nicotine pouch products and cigarettes.\nTobacco companies are subject to broad and evolving regulatory and legislative frameworks that could have a material impact on our businesses.  For example, the FDA submitted proposed product standards banning menthol in cigarettes, which was delayed indefinitely in April 2024, and banning all characterizing flavors in cigars, both of which were withdrawn in January 2025.  In addition, in January 2025, the FDA proposed a tobacco product standard that would establish a maximum nicotine level in cigarettes and certain other combustible tobacco products significantly lower than the average concentration in these products on the market today with the aim of making such products minimally or non-addictive.  The proposed rule is subject to the Trump Administration’s January 2025 executive order pausing all federal agency rulemaking for 60 days.  Following the 60-day pause, the proposed product standard, if not withdrawn, may proceed through the rulemaking process, including the solicitation of public comment.\nSee \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment\n for additional information on the trends and developments discussed above.\nABI’s business is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation, commodity price movements and other macroeconomic factors that could impact financial performance from time to time.  We will continue to monitor these conditions and other factors as they could affect our equity earnings, our other comprehensive earnings/losses and the dividends that we receive from ABI, and the fair value of our investment in ABI.  See Note 8 for additional information on our investment in ABI.\nThe trends and developments discussed above have not had a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we continue to monitor these trends and developments and potential financial impacts.  While the growth of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products has caused us to reassess certain of our 2028 Goals, we do not believe the trends and developments discussed above have materially impacted our ability to achieve our Vision.  As the trends and developments evolve and new ones emerge, we will continue to evaluate the potential impacts on our businesses, investments and Vision.\n21\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe changes in net earnings and diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2024, from the year ended December 31, 2023, were due primarily to the following:\n(in millions, except per share data)\nNet Earnings\nDiluted EPS\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\n$\n8,130 \n$\n4.57 \n2023 NPM Adjustment Items\n(38)\n(0.02)\n2023 Acquisition, disposition and integration-related items\n26 \n0.01 \n2023 Tobacco and health and certain other litigation items\n323 \n0.18 \n2023 Loss on disposition of JUUL equity securities\n250 \n0.14 \n2023 ABI-related special items\n70 \n0.03 \n2023 Cronos-related special items\n29 \n0.02 \n2023 Income tax items\n32 \n0.02 \nSubtotal 2023 special items\n692 \n0.38 \n2024 NPM Adjustment Items\n20\n \n0.01\n \n2024 Acquisition, disposition and integration-related items\n1,862\n \n1.08\n \n2024 Asset impairment, exit and implementation costs\n(315)\n(0.18)\n2024 Tobacco and health and certain other litigation items\n(76)\n(0.04)\n2024 ABI-related special items\n(2)\n—\n \n2024 Cronos-related special items\n(15)\n(0.01)\n2024 Income tax items\n969\n \n0.56\n \nSubtotal 2024 special items\n2,443\n \n1.42\n \nFewer shares outstanding\n—\n \n0.17\n \nChange in tax rate\n47\n \n0.03\n \nOperations\n(48)\n(0.03)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\n$\n11,264\n \n$\n6.54\n \n2024 Reported Net Earnings \n$\n11,264\n \n$\n6.54\n \n2023 Reported Net Earnings \n$\n8,130 \n$\n4.57 \n% Change\n38.5\n \n%\n43.1\n \n%\n2024 Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS\n$\n8,821\n \n$\n5.12\n \n2023 Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS\n$\n8,822 \n$\n4.95 \n% Change\n—\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\nFor a discussion of special items and other business drivers affecting the comparability of statements of earnings amounts and reconciliations of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS, see \nConsolidated Operating Results\n below.\n▪\nFewer Shares Outstanding: \nFewer shares outstanding were due to shares we repurchased under our share repurchase programs.\n▪\nChange in Tax Rate:\n The change in the tax rate (which excludes the impact of special items shown in the table above) was driven primarily by lower state tax expense.\n▪\nOperations: \nThe decrease of $48 million in operations (which excludes the impact of special items shown in the table above) was due primarily to lower OCI and lower net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost.\nFor further details, see\n Consolidated Operating Results \nand \nOperating Results by Business Segment \nbelow.\n22\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nCompounded EPS Growth Rate\nOur 2028 Goals include delivering a mid-single digits adjusted diluted EPS compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) in 2028 from a $4.84 base in 2022.

However, our management also reviews certain financial results, including OCI, OCI margins, net earnings and diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that our management believes are not part of underlying operations.  These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition, disposition and integration-related items, equity investment-related special items, certain income tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer (“NPM”) adjustment disputes under the Master Settlement Agreement (“NPM Adjustment Items”).  In addition, our management reviews the ratio of debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA, which we use as a factor to determine our ability to access the capital markets and make investments in pursuit of our Vision.  Consolidated EBITDA is calculated in accordance with our Credit Agreement (defined below in \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n) and includes certain adjustments.  Our management does not view any of these special items to be part of our underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results.  Our management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis, which may exclude certain income tax items from our reported effective tax rate.\nOur management believes that the foregoing financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results, and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results.  Our management uses these financial measures and regularly provides these to our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating capital and other resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.  The foregoing financial measures are not required by, or calculated in accordance with, GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.  The foregoing financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  When we provide a non-GAAP measure in this Form 10-K, we also provide a reconciliation of that non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nDiscussion and Analysis\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 2”) includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  In most instances, we must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under GAAP.\nThe preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.  Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n23\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nThe following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n▪\nRevenue Recognition: \nOur businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers.  Our businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives.  Our businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\nOur businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates.  We include expected payments for sales incentives in accrued marketing liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nFor further discussion, see Note 4. \nRevenues from Contracts with Customers \nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n▪\nDepreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation: \nWe depreciate property, plant and equipment and amortize our definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  We depreciate machinery and equipment over periods up to 20 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years.  We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If we determine that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  We base impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.  We also review the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\nWe conduct a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment as of October 1 of each year, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require us to perform an interim review.  We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.  If necessary, we will perform a single step quantitative impairment test.  Additionally, we have the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired.  We measure the amount of impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit; however, the amount of the impairment loss is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit.  If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, we consider the intangible asset to be impaired and reduce the carrying value to fair value in the period identified.\nWe use an income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and trademarks using information available as of the impairment testing date.  The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows.\nGoodwill by reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(in millions)\nGoodwill\nIndefinite-Lived\nIntangible Assets\nCigarettes\n$\n22\n \n$\n2\n \nMST products\n5,023\n \n8,447\n \nCigars\n77\n \n2,640\n \nOral nicotine pouches\n55\n \n—\n \nE-vapor\n1,768\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n6,945\n \n$\n11,089\n \nSecond Quarter of 2024 Skoal Impairment:\nAt December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark exceeded its carrying value of $3.9 billion by approximately 6% ($0.2 billion).  Sales volumes of MST products, including \nSkoal\n, have been negatively impacted due in part to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, which has resulted in consumers increasingly moving across tobacco categories.  In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2024, we evaluated the accelerated growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related increase in competitive activity among tobacco categories, which have \n24\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\ncontributed to reductions in sales volumes for MST products, including \nSkoal\n.  We concluded that the expected impact from the sales volume declines on the \nSkoal\n trademark represented a triggering event and, as a result of this conclusion, we performed an interim impairment assessment as of June 30, 2024.  We determined the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark as of June 30, 2024, was below its carrying value and recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of $354 million during the second quarter of 2024, which was recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Our estimate of the fair value and carrying value of the \nSkoal\n trademark at June 30, 2024 was $3.6 billion after recording the impairment.\n2024 Annual Review of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets:\nWe completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets performed as of October 1, 2024.  We elected to perform a qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets were below carrying value.  For certain of our other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we elected to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment.\nUpon completion of this testing, we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values in all circumstances and thus, no impairment charges were recorded.  The estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values for all of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets with the exception of our \nSkoal\n trademark and e-vapor reporting unit discussed below.\nAlthough the estimated fair value of the \nSkoal\n trademark exceeded its carrying value of $3.6 billion by approximately 7% ($0.3 billion), MST products, including \nSkoal\n, continued to be negatively impacted due in part to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, which have continued to contribute to reductions in sales volumes for MST products, including \nSkoal, \nas discussed above.  We believe if the decline in sales volume for \nSkoal\n is higher than currently estimated and results in material revenue declines, there may be a material adverse effect on the significant assumptions used in performing our valuation.  These adverse effects, including if \nSkoal\n’s actual revenue and income or long-term outlook are significantly unfavorable compared to forecasted performance used to estimate the fair value or if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value increases, could result in a material non-cash impairment of our \nSkoal\n trademark in future periods.  Based on the 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment charge to the \nSkoal\n intangible asset of approximately $85 million.\nWhile the estimated fair value of our e-vapor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 28% ($0.3 billion), we continue to monitor several factors that could impact the carrying value of our e-vapor reporting unit’s goodwill, including the following:\n▪\nAltria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY, are defendants in lawsuits alleging patent infringement based on the sale of \nNJOY ACE \nin the United States.  On January 29, 2025, the ITC issued its final determination regarding the complaint filed by JUUL against Altria and certain of our affiliates, including NJOY, finding that \nNJOY ACE\n infringes on JUUL’s patents and issued an exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders prohibiting the importation and sale of \nNJOY ACE\n in the United States.  The ITC’s determination is currently under a 60-day review period by the Office of the United States Trade Representative which could reject the ITC’s determination.  If the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC’s determination, the determination will automatically become final and the ITC’s orders will take effect on March 31, 2025, or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse.  The final exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but the final exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders prohibiting the importation and sale of \nNJOY ACE\n would likely not be stayed during the pendency of such an appeal.  We continue to vigorously defend this litigation, including our motion filed in February 2025 seeking reconsideration of the ITC’s determination on one of the four patents as discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K (“Item 3”).\n▪\nAdditionally, sales of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products continue to increase with limited effective enforcement against these products, contributing to declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume, which negatively impacted \nNJOY ACE’s \nvolume growth in 2024.\nWe are pursuing pathways to minimize the disruption the ITC’s decision could cause.  NJOY is working on a product solution that addresses all of the patents at issue in the event the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC’s determination.  Additionally, NJOY is pursuing potential solutions with a pipeline of other alternative e-vapor products.  However, in the event the Trade Representative does not affirmatively reject the ITC’s determination, it is likely that NJOY will not be able to sell \nNJOY ACE\n in the United States until a product solution addressing all of the patents at issue in the ITC action has received the necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf we continue to experience unfavorable outcomes with respect to the patent infringement lawsuits and our related strategies, or if continued illicit e-vapor product sales or other factors result in a significantly different long-term outlook for NJOY’s volume growth rates versus projections, there may be a material adverse effect on the significant assumptions used in performing our valuation.  These adverse effects, including if NJOY’s actual revenue and income or long-term outlook are significantly unfavorable compared to forecasted performance used to estimate the fair value or if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value increases, could result in a \n25\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nmaterial non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit’s goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets (carrying value of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024), or both, in future periods.  Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets.  The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast.  The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively.  Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, \nNJOY ACE\n; and (vi) ability of\n NJOY ACE\n to remain on the market.  Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows.  In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes.  For further discussion of these factors, see \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment \nbelow.\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the \nSkoal\n trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n▪\nInvestments in Equity Securities: \nAt the end of each reporting period, we\n \nreview our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value.  If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified.  We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n▪\nMarketing Costs:\n Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs.  These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues.  We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties.  Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.  For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n▪\nContingencies: \nAs discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees.  In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims.  PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, “State Settlement Agreements”).  \n26\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nPM USA’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due.  PM USA’s obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to make quarterly payments with respect to settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees ended in the fourth quarter of 2024.  In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA.  Payments under the State Settlement Agreements and the FDA user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment.  Our subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales.  Our subsidiaries recorded approximately $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees.\nWe record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in Note 20 and Item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any pending litigation; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any pending case; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.  We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include such costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n▪\nEmployee Benefit Plans: \nWe\n \nprovide a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits.  We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.  We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.  Any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and record as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (income).  We subsequently amortize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) into net periodic benefit cost (income) in future years.\nDue to changes in market factors, our discount rates used to determine our pension plan and postretirement plan obligations increased to 5.7% at December 31, 2024 from 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively, for these plans at December 31, 2023.  We presently anticipate net pre-tax pension and postretirement income of approximately $15 million in 2025 versus net pre-tax income of $46 million in 2024.  This decrease is due primarily to lower expected income on plan assets and higher amortization of net unrecognized losses in 2025, partially offset by lower service and interest costs.  Assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in our discount rates would increase (decrease) our pension and postretirement expense by approximately $10 million.  Similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our pension and postretirement expense by approximately $40 million.\nFor additional information see Note 18. \nBenefit Plans\n to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 18”).\n▪\nIncome Taxes:\n Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.  We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  We determine the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence.  In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements.  We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2024 and 2023 as a result of various tax events.\nFor additional information on income taxes, see Note 16. \nIncome Taxes \nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 16”).\n27\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nConsolidated Operating Results\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet Revenues:\nSmokeable products\n$\n21,204\n \n$\n21,756 \nOral tobacco products\n2,776\n \n2,667 \nAll other\n38\n \n60 \nNet revenues\n$\n24,018\n \n$\n24,483 \nExcise Taxes on Products:\nSmokeable products\n$\n3,469\n \n$\n3,869 \nOral tobacco products\n105\n \n112 \nExcise taxes on products\n$\n3,574\n \n$\n3,981 \nOperating Income:\nOCI:\nSmokeable products\n$\n10,821\n \n$\n10,670 \nOral tobacco products\n1,449\n \n1,722 \nAll other\n(414)\n(74)\nAmortization of intangibles\n(139)\n(128)\nGeneral corporate expenses\n(476)\n(643)\nOperating income\n$\n11,241\n \n$\n11,547 \nAs discussed further in Note 17, our CODM reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, our segments.

We recorded a corresponding adjustment to the JUUL tax valuation allowance in 2023.  For further discussion, see Note 8 and Note 16.\n▪\nABI-Related Special Items: \nWe recorded net pre-tax expense of $2 million from our investment in ABI for the year ended December 31, 2024, which consists primarily of mark-to-market losses on certain ABI financial instruments associated with its share commitments, mostly offset by a gain related to the ABI Transaction.  For further information on the gain related to the ABI Transaction, see Note 8.\nWe recorded net pre-tax losses of $89 million from our investment in ABI for the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting primarily of mark-to-market losses on certain ABI financial instruments associated with its share commitments and a loss on ABI’s sale of certain brands and associated assets in the United States.\nThe ABI-related special items include our respective share of the amounts recorded by ABI and additional adjustments related to (i) the conversion of ABI-related special items from international financial reporting standards to GAAP and (ii) adjustments to our investment required under the equity method of accounting.\n▪\nCronos-Related Special Items: \nWe recorded pre-tax losses of $29 million for Cronos-related special items for the year ended December 31, 2023, substantially all of which related to our share of special items recorded by Cronos.  We recorded a corresponding adjustment to the Cronos tax valuation allowance.\n▪\nIncome Tax Items:\n We recorded income tax items of $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, due primarily to an income tax benefit from partial releases of valuation allowances on JUUL-related losses in connection with an agreement reached in October 2024 with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and in connection with the ABI Transaction.  For further discussion, see Note 16.\nWe recorded income tax items of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to tax expense associated with a tax basis adjustment related to our investment in ABI.\n2024 Compared with 2023\nNet revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $465 million (1.9%), due primarily to lower net revenues in the smokeable products segment, partially offset by higher net revenues in the oral tobacco products segment.\nCost of sales decreased $141 million (2.3%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in our smokeable products segment, partially offset by higher per unit settlement charges and higher manufacturing costs in our smokeable products segment and higher NJOY costs.\nExcise taxes on products decreased $407 million (10.2%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in our smokeable products segment.\nMarketing, administration and research costs were unchanged compared to 2023 as higher costs, including NJOY and other costs in support of our Vision and 2024 costs related to the Initiative, were offset by lower general corporate expenses.  The lower general corporate expenses were due primarily to lower charges to resolve certain JUUL-related litigation and the 2023 settlement of the shareholder derivative lawsuits, partially offset by higher net acquisition-related costs primarily associated with the NJOY Transaction and 2024 transaction costs from the ABI Transaction.  See Note 3, Note 8 and Note 20 for a discussion of litigation items.\n29\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nOperating income decreased $306 million (2.7%), due primarily to lower OCI (which includes a non-cash impairment of the \nSkoal\n trademark in our oral tobacco product segment and costs related to the Initiative), partially offset by lower general corporate expenses.\nInterest and other debt expense, net increased $48 million (4.9%), due primarily to 2023 interest income associated with the sale of the \nIQOS \nSystem commercialization rights and unfavorable NPM Adjustment Items, partially offset by 2023 interest expense and fees for the term loan facility associated with the NJOY Transaction.  For additional information regarding the sale of the\n IQOS\n System commercialization rights, see Note 6.\nNet periodic benefit income, excluding service cost, decreased by $25 million (19.7%), due primarily to lower income on plan assets and higher amortization of net unrecognized losses in 2024.  For additional information, see Note 18.\n(Income) losses from investments in equity securities, which were favorable $409 million (100+%), were positively impacted by the 2023 loss on the disposition of our JUUL equity securities and favorable results in 2024 from our investment in ABI (due primarily to our gain on the ABI Transaction).\nProvision for income taxes decreased $404 million (14.4%), due primarily to favorable tax items, partially offset by higher earnings before income taxes.  For additional information, see Note 16.\nReported net earnings of $11,264 million increased $3,134 million (38.5%), due primarily to the gain on the sale of the \nIQOS\n System commercialization rights, favorable income tax items and favorable results from our investments in equity securities, partially offset by lower operating income.  Reported basic and diluted EPS of $6.54, each increased by 43.1% due to higher reported net earnings and fewer shares outstanding.\nAdjusted net earnings of $8,821 million were essentially unchanged compared to 2023, as lower OCI and lower net periodic benefit income, excluding service costs, was offset by a lower adjusted tax rate.  Adjusted diluted EPS of $5.12 increased by 3.4%, due to fewer shares outstanding.\n \nOperating Results by Business Segment\nBusiness Environment\nSummary\nThe U.S. tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position or our ability to achieve our Vision.  These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail in Note 20, Item 1A and Item 3, include:\n▪\npending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements;\n▪\nrestrictions and requirements imposed by the FSPTCA and restrictions and requirements (and related enforcement actions) that have been, and in the future will be, imposed by the FDA;\n▪\nthe FDA’s failure to effectively address illicit tobacco products on the market, including illicit e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products;\n▪\nillicit trade in tobacco products, including cigarettes, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouch products;\n▪\nactual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements;\n▪\nbans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers;\n▪\nother federal, state and local government actions, including:\n▪\nrestrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes;\n▪\nadditional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products;\n▪\nother actual and proposed tobacco-related legislation and regulation; and\n▪\ngovernmental investigations;\n▪\nreductions in consumption levels of cigarettes and MST products resulting in lower shipment volumes;\n▪\nincreased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities (including retail establishments) to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products or the ability to communicate with consumers through third-party digital platforms;\n▪\nchanges in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior, which is influenced by various factors such as macroeconomic conditions (including inflation), the proliferation of illicit disposable e-vapor products, excise taxes and price gap relationships, each of which may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to lower-priced tobacco products and lower shipment volumes;\n▪\nthe highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories, including competitive disadvantages related to the impact on cigarette prices due to the settlement of certain healthcare cost recovery litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products;\n30\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\n▪\nthe proliferation of products using nicotine analogues that are designed to imitate the effects of nicotine but are not subject to the FDA regulatory framework for tobacco products; and\n▪\npotential adverse changes in prices, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials and component parts, including as a result of changes in macroeconomic, geopolitical and climate and environmental conditions.\nIn addition to and in connection with the foregoing, evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences continue to impact the tobacco industry, including negatively impacting cigarette and MST shipment volumes.  We believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch among tobacco categories, use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches.  As innovative smoke-free products evolve to better address the preferences of adult tobacco consumers, these consumers continue to transition from cigarettes and MST products to exclusive use of innovative smoke-free tobacco product alternatives, which aligns with our Vision.  As a result, long-term trends in the overall nicotine space are improving.  Industry equivalized nicotine volumes increased for the second consecutive year in 2024 and grew by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 2% over the past five years.\nWe work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing products both within and outside the United States through innovation and other growth strategies (including, where appropriate, arrangements with, or investments in, third parties and acquisitions).\nWe estimate that, when adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, total estimated domestic cigarette industry volume declined by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 9% for the full year.  PM USA reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 10.2% for the full year.  When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, PM USA volumes for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year each declined by an estimated 11%.  In the fourth quarter, \nMarlboro\n share of the total cigarette category was 41.3%, a decrease of 1.0 share point versus the prior year and 0.3 share points in the fourth quarter.  \nMarlboro\n share performance is discussed further in the \nOperating Results - Smokeable Products Segment\n below.\nWe have been monitoring shifts in adult tobacco consumer preferences and their effects on cigarette industry decline rates.  As a result, we believe that the decline in adult smokers, excluding any cross category movement, resulted in an estimated 2.5% decline in cigarette industry volume over the 12 months ended December 31, 2024.  We estimate that cross-category movement contributed to cigarette industry volume declines in a range of approximately 3% to 4% over the 12 months ended December 31, 2024.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, we estimate the e-vapor category grew approximately 30% versus the prior 12-month period, driven by the growth of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products.  We estimate that illicit products now represent more than 60% of the e-vapor category.  These illicit disposable e-vapor products are largely distributed through non-traditional retail channels (including e-commerce and vape retail channels), making them more difficult to track.  In addition, we believe illicit cigarettes are becoming more prevalent in the United States, based on the results of discarded pack studies we conducted in select geographies.  We believe the FDA’s inadequate enforcement and slow pace of smoke-free product authorizations enables bad actors to disregard regulation and illicit products to proliferate.  Through our competitive intelligence tracking, we continue to monitor these growing trends and evaluate the impacts on the overall nicotine and tobacco categories.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, reported shipment volume of NJOY consumables (including \nNJOY ACE\n and \nNJOY DAILY\n) was approximately 12.8 million units, and NJOY device shipment volume was approximately 1.1 million units.  The NJOY share of the pod-based e-vapor category reached 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 0.2 share points sequentially and 2.8 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe U.S. nicotine pouch category continued to grow significantly throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 to 45.7% of the U.S. oral tobacco category, an increase of 9.6 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.  \non!\n maintained year-over-year share momentum through the fourth quarter of 2024 to achieve 8.9% of the total oral tobacco category, an increase of 2.0 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023 and unchanged sequentially.\nFor the fourth quarter 2024, the traditional smokeless category (including MST) share of the total oral tobacco category declined to 54.3%, down 9.6 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.  \nCopenhagen\n had an oral tobacco category share of 18.1% for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3.6 share points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.  We continue to track the growth of nicotine pouch volumes and the related impact on the size of the MST category.  Decreases in the size of the MST category could impact the carrying value of our assets, such as our smokeless tobacco product goodwill and trademarks.  For example, in the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment on the value of the \nSkoal \ntrademark.\nThroughout the full year 2024, U.S. adult tobacco consumers remained under pressure largely due to the compounding effects of high prices exceeding overall wage growth.  In addition, consumer credit and credit card delinquency rates rose to the highest levels since 2011 in the first half of 2024.  While recent reports indicate that consumer credit and delinquency rates are beginning to moderate, these rates remain at historically high levels.  Although the monthly rate of inflation stabilized during the year, headwinds continued for U.S. adult tobacco consumers.  Gas prices throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 experienced seasonal declines, averaging $3.02 per gallon for the month of December 2024.  While gas prices were lower than in the prior year, they remained consistently above $3.00 per gallon throughout 2024.\n31\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nDiscretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers have influenced discount brand share performance.  For the fourth quarter of 2024, the discount share of the cigarette category reached 30.4%, an increase of 0.6 share points sequentially and an increase of 1.7 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe continue to monitor the evolving regulatory, macroeconomic and consumer dynamics within our business environment for impacts on our businesses.  Changes in these and other conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nFSPTCA and FDA Regulation\n▪\nThe Regulatory Framework:\n \nThe FSPTCA and its related regulations establish broad FDA regulatory authority over all tobacco products and, among other provisions:\n▪\nimpose restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products (see \nFinal Tobacco Marketing Rule\n below);\n▪\nestablish pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products (see \nPre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement\n below);\n▪\nprohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;\n▪\nauthorize the FDA to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (see \nPotential Product Standards\n below); and\n▪\nequip the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities (see \nInvestigation and Enforcement\n below).\nThe FSPTCA also bans descriptors such as “light,” “low” or “mild” when used as descriptors of modified risk, unless expressly authorized by the FDA.\nEffective April 2022, the U.S. Congress expanded the statutory definition of tobacco products to include products containing nicotine derived from any source, including synthetic nicotine.  See \nPre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement\n below for additional information on the effects of the statutory change.  Currently, however, the statutory definition of tobacco products does not cover products containing nicotine analogues, which are designed to imitate the effects of nicotine.  As a result, products containing nicotine analogues are not subject to the FDA regulatory framework for tobacco products, including the requirements that manufacturers submit a PMTA to, and receive an MGO from, the FDA before marketing such products in the United States.\n▪\nFinal Tobacco Marketing Rule: \nAs required by the FSPTCA, in March 2010, the FDA promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco\n(1)\n products (the “Final Tobacco Marketing Rule”).  The May 2016 deeming regulations amended the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule to expand specific provisions to all tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco and e-vapor and oral nicotine products containing tobacco-derived nicotine or other tobacco derivatives.\nThe Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, as amended, among other things:\n▪\nrestricts the use of non-tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products;\n▪\nprohibits sampling of all tobacco products except that sampling of smokeless tobacco products is permitted in qualified adult-only facilities;\n▪\nprohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos;\n▪\nprohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical, artistic or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event; and\n▪\nrequires the development by the FDA of graphic warnings for cigarettes, establishes warning requirements for other tobacco products and gives the FDA the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco product (see \nFDA Regulatory Actions - Graphic Warnings\n below).\nSubject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule took effect in June 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products containing tobacco-derived nicotine, and in April 2022 for tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products, that contain nicotine from any source other than tobacco, such as synthetic nicotine.  The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule currently does not apply to products containing nicotine analogues.\n▪\nRulemaking and Guidance: \nFrom time to time, the FDA issues proposed regulations and guidance, which may be issued in draft or final form, that generally involve public comment and may include scientific review.  The FDA also may request comments on \n(1)\n \n“Smokeless tobacco,” as used in this section of this Form 10-K, refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the FDA in 2009, including MST.\n \nIt excludes oral nicotine pouches, which were first regulated by the FDA in 2016.\n32\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nbroad topics through an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”).  We actively engage with the FDA to develop and implement the FSPTCA’s regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.\nThe FDA’s implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states, territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements (see \nState Settlement Agreements\n below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our operating companies’ ability to market and sell tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.\n▪\nFDA’s Five-Year Strategic Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation:\n In December 2023, the FDA released its five-year strategic plan to address concerns raised by the Reagan-Udall Foundation’s operational evaluation of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.  The Reagan-Udall report urged the FDA to clearly define product pathways, accelerate PMTA decision making, address the need for health risk communications to tobacco consumers and take enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law.\nThe FDA’s five-year strategic plan lists five goals:\n▪\ndevelop, advance and communicate comprehensive and impactful tobacco regulations and guidance;\n▪\nensure timely, clear and consistent product application review;\n▪\nstrengthen compliance of regulated industry using all available tools, including robust enforcement actions;\n▪\nenhance knowledge and understanding of the risks associated with tobacco product use; and\n▪\nadvance operational excellence.\nAlthough the FDA, in conjunction with other federal entities, has increased enforcement activity, insufficient actions against manufacturers, distributors and retailers of certain product categories that violate the law, including certain disposable and flavored e-vapor products, certain oral nicotine pouch products and products targeted to minors, have allowed such products to proliferate on the market.  In addition, the FDA’s failure to clearly define product pathways and accelerate PMTA decision making has resulted in a market with few authorized smoke-free products available to adult tobacco consumers.\n▪\nPre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement: \nThe FSPTCA permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of February 15, 2007 and not subsequently modified (“Pre-existing Tobacco Products”) and new or modified products authorized through the PMTA, Substantial Equivalence (“SE”) or SE Exemption pathways.  Subsequent FDA rules also provide a Supplemental PMTA pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products.\nThe FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability on the market, specifically:\n▪\nPre-existing Tobacco Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement;\n▪\ncigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered “Provisional Products” for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011.  These reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent, or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health; \n▪\ntobacco products that were first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not Pre-existing Tobacco Products, are generally products for which either an SE report or PMTA needed to be filed by September 9, 2020; and\n▪\ntobacco products containing nicotine from any source other than tobacco (\ne.g.\n, synthetic nicotine) that were on the market between March 15, 2022 and April 14, 2022 and are not Pre-existing Tobacco Products are generally products for which a manufacturer must have filed a PMTA by May 14, 2022.  A manufacturer was permitted to keep such a product on the market until July 13, 2022 provided that a PMTA was filed by May 14, 2022.  Thereafter, unless the FDA granted the product a marketing order, the product is subject to possible FDA enforcement.\nModifications to currently marketed products, including modifications that result from, for example, changes to the quantity of tobacco product(s) in a package, a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier or contract manufacturer being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients or manufacturing processes, could trigger the FDA’s pre-market review processes.  Additionally, a manufacturer may be unable to maintain consistency in manufacturing processes as it increases the scale of its manufacturing operations in response to market expansion or product introduction.  These circumstances could cause a manufacturer to receive (i) a “not substantially equivalent” determination or (ii) a denial or withdrawal of a PMTA, either of which could result in a product being removed from the market.  In addition, new scientific data continues to be developed relating to innovative tobacco products, which could impact the FDA’s determination as to whether a product is, or continues to be, appropriate for the protection of public health and could, therefore, result in the removal of one or more products from the market.  Any such actions affecting our \n33\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\noperating companies’ products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nProducts Regulated in 2009\n:\n \nMost cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are “Provisional Products.”  PM USA and USSTC timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products and have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products.  Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA’s determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results.  PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA’s pre-market review process.  In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review.  PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\nWhile we believe PM USA’s and USSTC’s current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, we cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports.  Should PM USA or USSTC receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, we believe PM USA and USSTC can replace the vast majority of these product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Pre-existing Tobacco Products.\nCigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are “Non-Provisional Products” and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale.  Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, a PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA.  PM USA and USSTC may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\nProducts Regulated in 2016\n: Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or a PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market.  These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA.  In September 2022, the FDA represented that it had resolved more than 99% of the timely applications it had received, the vast majority of which were for e-vapor products and resulted in denials.  A number of the denials are subject to challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers.  For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion.  For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or a PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\nHelix submitted PMTAs for\n on! \noral nicotine pouches in May 2020 and PMTAs for \non! PLUS\n oral nicotine pouches in tobacco, mint and wintergreen flavors in June 2024.  As of February 24, 2025, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any \non!\n or \non! PLUS \nproducts.\nAs of February 24, 2025, Middleton has received marketing orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\nIn \nOctober 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC’s \nVerve\n oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed innovative products.  These products are not currently marketed or sold.\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized USSTC to communicate a modified risk claim about its \nCopenhagen Classic Snuff\n MST product.  This product is not currently marketed or sold.  The authorized claim for \nCopenhagen Classic Snuff \nis “IF YOU SMOKE, CONSIDER THIS:  Switching completely to this product from cigarettes reduces risk of lung cancer.”  In February 2025, USSTC filed a notice with the FDA withdrawing its modified risk application.\nAs a result of our June 2023 acquisition of NJOY Holdings, we gained full global ownership of NJOY’s e-vapor product portfolio, including \nNJOY ACE\n, a pod-based e-vapor product with an MGO from the FDA, and \nNJOY DAILY\n, which also has an MGO.  In June 2024, NJOY received MGOs with respect to two \nNJOY ACE \nmenthol\n \nproducts and two \nNJOY DAILY \nmenthol products.  In May 2024, NJOY submitted a supplemental PMTA to the FDA to commercialize and market the \nNJOY ACE 2.0\n device, which leverages Bluetooth\n®\n connectivity to incorporate access restriction technology designed to prevent underage use by authenticating the user before unlocking the device.  Also in May 2024, NJOY re-submitted PMTAs for blueberry and watermelon flavored pod-based e-vapor products that work exclusively with the Bluetooth\n®\n-enabled \nNJOY ACE 2.0\n device.  These products previously received marketing denial orders (“MDOs”) on the basis of FDA concerns regarding underage use.\nPost-Market Surveillance\n: Manufacturers that receive MGOs must adhere to the FDA post-market record keeping and reporting requirements, as detailed in market orders and in the final PMTA rule.  The requirements include prior notification of marketing activities.  The FDA may amend requirements of an MGO or withdraw the MGO based on this information if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.\n34\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nEffect of Adverse FDA Determinations\n: FDA review time frames have varied.  It is therefore difficult to predict the duration of FDA reviews of SE reports or PMTAs.  An unfavorable determination on an application, the withdrawal by the FDA of a prior MGO or other changes in FDA regulatory requirements could result in the removal of products from the market.  A “not substantially equivalent” determination, a denial of a PMTA or an MGO withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products (which would require the removal of the product or products from the market) could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  Also, adverse FDA determinations on innovative tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n▪\nFDA Regulatory Actions\n▪\nGraphic Warnings\n:\n \nIn March 2020, the FDA issued a final rule requiring 11 textual warnings accompanied by color graphics depicting certain negative health consequences of smoking on cigarette packaging and advertising.  PM USA and other cigarette manufacturers filed lawsuits challenging the final rule on substantive and procedural grounds.  In December 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas found in favor of cigarette manufacturers in one such suit and blocked the rule, finding it unconstitutional on the basis that it compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment.  The FDA appealed the decision, and, in March 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings.  In August 2024, the cigarette manufacturers in the suit petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, which the U.S. Supreme Court declined to do in November 2024.\nIn January 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas found in favor of cigarette manufacturers that had challenged the final rule on the basis that the FDA exceeded its statutory authority by requiring cigarette packaging and advertising to contain 11 specific warnings when it only had the authority to require nine.  In its ruling, the court granted a preliminary injunction staying the FDA’s enforcement of the rule against all cigarette manufacturers pending further litigation.\nIn December 2024, PM USA and several Georgia co-plaintiffs filed suit against the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, challenging the final rule on substantive and procedural grounds.  Briefing is ongoing, and a hearing on PM USA’s request to enjoin the rule is set for April 2025.\n▪\nUnderage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products\n:\n \nThe FDA announced regulatory actions in September 2018 to address underage access to and use of e-vapor products.  We have engaged with the FDA on this topic and have reaffirmed to the FDA our ongoing and long-standing commitment to preventing underage use.  For example, we advocated raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels to further address underage use, which is now federal law.  We continue to advocate in states that have not yet raised the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21.  See \nFederal, State and Local Legislation to Increase the Legal Age to Purchase Tobacco Products \nbelow for further discussion.\nAdditionally, the FDA issued final guidance in April 2020, stating that it intended to prioritize enforcement action against certain product categories, including pod-based, flavored e-vapor products and products targeted to minors.  More recently, the FDA has taken limited  action aimed at manufacturers and retailers of certain disposable flavored e-vapor products.  However, despite some enforcement activity, insufficient actions against manufacturers, distributors and retailers of certain product categories that violate the law, including certain disposable and flavored e-vapor products, certain oral nicotine pouch products and products targeted to minors, have allowed such products to proliferate on the market.\n▪\nE-Vapor Products\n: As of February 24, 2025, many manufacturers of menthol and other flavored e-vapor products have received MDOs for failure to provide sufficiently strong product-specific scientific evidence to demonstrate that the benefit of their products to adult smokers overcomes the risk that their products pose to youth.  The FDA has communicated in these MDOs that vapor products with non-tobacco flavors present unique questions relevant to the FDA’s “Appropriate for the Protection of Public Health” standard and that successful applications require strong, product-specific evidence.  A number of these manufacturers are challenging the MDOs for their products.  In January 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the FDA process and procedure for addressing an e-vapor PMTA violated federal law and that, among other things, the FDA failed to give the manufacturer plaintiff fair notice of, and repeatedly changed positions with respect to, the information required to obtain a PMTA.  The court decided the case \nen banc\n, with all judges on the court hearing the case.  In July 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and the case was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2024.  Other U.S. Courts of Appeals have upheld adverse FDA determinations, and there are pending requests that the U.S. Supreme Court review these decisions.\n▪\nPotential Product Standards\n▪\nNicotine in Cigarettes and Other Combustible Tobacco Products\n:\n \nIn March 2018, the FDA issued an ANPRM seeking comments on the potential public health benefits and any possible adverse effects of lowering nicotine in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels.  In January 2025, the FDA proposed a tobacco product standard that would establish a maximum nicotine level in cigarettes and certain other combustible tobacco products (including little cigars, cigarillos and most large cigars) significantly lower than the average concentration in these products currently on the market with the aim of making such products minimally or non-addictive.  The proposed rule does not apply to e-vapor products, \n35\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nnicotine pouches, heated tobacco products, MST products or premium cigars.  The proposed rule is subject to the Trump Administration’s January 2025 executive order pausing all federal agency rulemaking for 60 days.  Following the 60-day pause, the proposed product standard, if not withdrawn, may proceed through the rulemaking process, including the solicitation of public comment, which we believe would take multiple years to complete.\n▪\nFlavors in Tobacco Products\n:\n \nIn April 2022, the FDA issued two proposed product standards: (i) banning menthol in cigarettes and (ii) banning all characterizing flavors (including menthol) in cigars.  We submitted comments during the notice-and-comment period.  In October 2023, the FDA submitted the two proposed product standards to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review.  In April 2024, the FDA announced the indefinite delay of a decision on the menthol ban, citing the high volume of feedback received during the notice-and-comment period.  In January 2025, the Trump Administration withdrew the two proposed product standards from the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) and sent them back to the FDA.\n▪\nN-nitrosonornicotine (“NNN”) in Smokeless Tobacco\n:\n \nIn January 2017, the FDA proposed a product standard for NNN levels in finished smokeless tobacco products.\nIf any one or more of the foregoing potential product standards were to become final and was appealed and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, including a material adverse effect on the carrying value of certain of our assets such as our cigar trademarks.\n▪\nTobacco Product Manufacturing Practices: \nIn March 2023, the FDA, pursuant to the requirements of the FSPTCA, issued a proposed rule setting forth requirements for tobacco product manufacturers regarding the manufacture, design, packing and storage of their products.  This proposed rule establishes a framework of tobacco product manufacturing practices, including by:\n▪\nestablishing tobacco product design and development controls;\n▪\nensuring that finished and bulk tobacco products are manufactured according to established specifications;\n▪\nminimizing the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products that do not meet specifications;\n▪\nrequiring manufacturers to take appropriate measures to prevent contamination of tobacco products;\n▪\nrequiring investigation and identification of products that do not meet specifications and requiring manufacturers to institute appropriate corrective actions, such as a recall; and\n▪\nestablishing the ability to trace all components or parts, ingredients, additives and materials, as well as each batch of finished or bulk tobacco products, to aid in investigations of those that do not meet specifications.\nWe engaged with the FDA through the rulemaking process, including during the notice-and-comment period, which closed in October 2023.  OMB currently lists the rule as a long-term action.  If the proposed rule were to take effect, our operating companies could experience increased costs to comply with the rule.\n▪\nImpact on Our Business; Compliance Costs and User Fees: \nAdditional FDA regulatory actions under the FSPTCA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position in various ways.  For example, actions (or inaction) by the FDA could:\n▪\nimpact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products;\n▪\ndiscontinue, delay or prevent the sale or distribution of existing, new or modified tobacco products;\n▪\nlimit adult tobacco consumer choices;\n▪\nimpose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers;\n▪\ncreate a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies;\n▪\nimpose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements;\n▪\nimpose additional restrictions at retail;\n▪\nresult in increased illicit trade in tobacco products; and\n▪\notherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.\nThe FSPTCA imposes user fees on cigarette, cigarette tobacco, smokeless tobacco, cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters.  The FSPTCA does not impose user fees on e-vapor products or oral nicotine pouch manufacturers.  The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations.  Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume.  See \nLiquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation \nbelow for a discussion of our FDA user fee payments.  In addition, our operating companies’ compliance with the FSPTCA’s regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs.  The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year-to-date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate.  The failure to comply with FDA \n36\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nregulatory requirements, even inadvertently, and FDA enforcement actions also could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n▪\nInvestigation and Enforcement: \nThe FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, facility closures, examinations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures.  Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nExcise Taxes\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States.  Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States.  The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\nFederal, state and local cigarette excise taxes have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation.  Between the end of 1998 and February 24, 2025, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.93 per pack.  Three states (Maryland, Colorado and Rhode Island) increased excise taxes in 2024.  As of February 24, 2025, no states have increased excise taxes in 2025.  However, various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\nA majority of states currently tax MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price.  This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight.  We support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax.  As of February 24, 2025, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST.  North Carolina has passed legislation that will cause the state to adopt a weight-based tax methodology for MST in July 2025.\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches.  As of February 24, 2025, 33 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products.  These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form.  Similarly, 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our operating companies’ products through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult tobacco consumer purchases from premium to non-premium or discount cigarettes, to lower taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products.  Lower sales volume and reported share performance of our operating companies’ products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  In addition, substantial excise tax increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers’ transition to these products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\nInternational Treaty on Tobacco Control\nThe World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the “FCTC”) entered into force in February 2005.  As of February 24, 2025, 182 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC.  While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate.  The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation.  The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the United States, either indirectly or as a result of the United States becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.\nState Settlement Agreements\nAs discussed in Note 20, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements.  These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume.  Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements.  The State Settlement Agreements’ inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (“CPI-U”) percentage rate as published in January of each year.  As of December 2024, the inflation calculation was approximately 2.9% based on the latest CPI-U data.  We will continue to monitor the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment and our businesses.\n37\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on us, see\n Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation \nbelow and Note 20.  The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.  Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities).  The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters.  In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the “STMSA”) with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC.  The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions.  USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\nOther International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n▪\nInternational, Federal, State and Local Regulation:\n \nVarious states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings, (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products and (v) requires manufacturers of e-vapor products to certify that they are in compliance with FDA requirements to be allowed to sell in the state.  The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions.  For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products.  As of February 24, 2025, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Utah) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation.  Some states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.  The legislation in California, which became effective in December 2022, bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen.\nIndiana, Massachusetts and Utah passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products.  As of February 24, 2025, legislation relating to this issue is pending in three other states.\nSimilar restrictions to those enacted or proposed in various U.S. states and localities on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products have been enacted or proposed internationally.\nWe have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation.  Certain legislation imposing restrictions on tobacco products, such as state laws requiring manufacturers of e-vapor products to certify that they are in compliance with federal law in order to sell products in the state, aligns with our Vision, and we actively engage with lawmakers in support of such legislation.  It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers’ transition to smoke-free products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n▪\nFederal, State and Local Legislation to Increase the Legal Age to Purchase Tobacco Products: \nIn December 2019, after a number of states and localities proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, the federal government passed legislation increasing the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, to 21 nationwide.  As of February 24, 2025, 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted laws increasing the legal age to purchase tobacco products to 21.  Although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on our operating companies’ sales volumes, we support raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels, as discussed above under \nUnderage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products\n, reflecting our longstanding commitment to combat underage tobacco use.\n▪\nHealth Effects of Tobacco Products, Including E-vapor Products: \nReports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years, including various reports by the U.S. Surgeon General.  We believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the U.S. Surgeon General and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products, including e-vapor products.  Along with the scientific and public health communities, we continue to study and gather scientific evidence concerning the health effects of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products.  It is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such \n38\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nresearch on legislation and regulation.  Scientific determinations as to any health risks or negative health consequences associated with the use of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco products businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places.  Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children.\n▪\nOther Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: \nIn addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions.  For example, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; impose responsibility on manufacturers for the disposal, recycling or other treatment of post-consumer goods such as plastic packaging; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products.  Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful.  In addition, if a pandemic or similar health emergency occurs, state and local governments may reimpose additional health and safety requirements for all businesses, which could result in the potential temporary closure of certain businesses and facilities.  It is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers’ suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally.  Any such legislation, regulation or other governmental action could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n▪\nGovernmental Investigations: \nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.  For example, we currently are, or recently have been, subject to a number of governmental investigations with respect to our former investment in JUUL, which we divested in March 2023, including the following: (i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued a Civil Investigative Demand to us while conducting its antitrust review of our former investment in JUUL; (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to our acquisition, disclosures and accounting\n \ncontrols in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to us seeking documents relating to our former investment in and provision of services to JUUL.  For a discussion of our disposition of our former investment in JUUL, see Note 8.\nIn April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the lawsuits relating to our former investment in JUUL initiated by the attorneys general of Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico, respectively.\nPrivate Sector Activity on Tobacco Products\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of all tobacco products, and others have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products.  Reasons for the discontinuation include change in corporate policy and, with respect to e-vapor products, reported illnesses and the uncertain regulatory environment.  Furthermore, third-party digital platforms, such as app stores, have restricted, and in some cases prohibited, communications with adult tobacco consumers concerning tobacco products.  It is possible that if this private sector activity becomes more widespread it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIllicit Trade in Tobacco Products\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies’ innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products.  Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another.  Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments.  Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands.  Illicit disposable e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products may be designed to appeal to youth and are manufactured without scientific standards, exposing consumers to undocumented risks.  Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels.  Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues.  Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing \n39\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nlegislative or regulatory requirements, or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nWe communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how we can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect our trademarks.  We also engage with the FDA and other government agencies to advocate for a well-regulated U.S. tobacco industry that embraces harm reduction and the enforcement of existing regulatory frameworks.\nProhibitory policies, such as California’s ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products, which went into effect in 2022, can have unintended negative consequences, including the proliferation of counterfeit and unregulated products.  We actively engage with regulators, state and federal lawmakers, our trade partners and other stakeholders to bring awareness to these issues.  When appropriate, we also take legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor product business, such as the lawsuit we have filed in federal court in California against manufacturers of illicit e-vapor products.\nIn June 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the FDA announced the creation of a federal multi-agency task force to combat the illegal marketing and sale of e-vapor products in the United States.  The announcement noted that, in addition to the DOJ and the FDA, the task force will leverage the criminal and civil law enforcement capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FTC and that additional agencies may join the task force in the future.  The DOJ and the FDA stated that the task force will focus on many topics, such as investigating and prosecuting new criminal, civil, seizure and forfeiture actions under various U.S. laws, including the FSPTCA.\nPrice, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions, adverse weather patterns and natural disasters), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, labor disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco and other raw materials, ingredients and component parts used to manufacture our operating companies’ products.  Any significant change in the nature or consequences of these factors could negatively impact our ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products, increase our costs or negatively impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability and have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nAs with other agricultural commodities, tobacco price, quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns and natural disasters, including those caused by climate change, and macroeconomic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand, among other factors.  For varieties of tobacco only available in limited geographies, government-mandated prices and production control programs, political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco in certain countries pose additional risks to price, availability and quality.  As consumer demand increases for innovative smoke-free products and decreases for combustible and MST products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production of these products has decreased, resulting in reduced tobacco leaf demand.  Reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco and increased costs, as growers divert resources to other crops or cease farming.  Macroeconomic factors, such as tariffs, may exacerbate reductions in demand for tobacco leaf by increasing the cost of purchasing tobacco leaf from a supplier in another country.  The unavailability or unacceptability of any one or more particular varieties of tobacco leaf or the unavailability of nicotine extract necessary to manufacture our operating companies’ products could negatively impact our ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.  In addition, the nicotine used in our operating companies’ innovative smoke-free products is extracted from tobacco produced in one country.  If we are unable to identify alternate sources of nicotine for our operating companies’ innovative products, we could be exposed to supply risk.\nCurrent geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions (including tariffs, inflation, high interest rates, labor shortages, supply and demand imbalances and international armed conflict) and adverse weather events have caused and continue to cause worldwide disruptions and delays to supply chains and commercial markets, which limit access to, and increase the cost of, raw materials, ingredients and component parts (for example, wood tips used in our cigar products and aluminum used in our packaging).  As consumer demand increases for innovative smoke-free products and decreases for combustible and MST products, the volume of raw materials, ingredients and component parts required for the production of combustible and MST products has decreased.  Reduced demand for raw materials, ingredients and component parts may reduce supply and availability of raw materials, ingredients and component parts as suppliers divert resources to other products or cease producing these products.  Furthermore, challenging economic conditions can create the risk that our suppliers, distributors, logistics providers or other third-party partners suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to provide us with or distribute finished product, raw materials and component parts and services in a timely manner or at all.  If we are unable to identify alternate sources of raw materials, ingredients and component parts for our operating companies’ products, we could be exposed to supply risk.\nWe have implemented and continue to implement various strategies to help secure sufficient supplies of raw materials, ingredients and component parts for production, including maintaining inventory levels of certain tobacco varieties that cover several years, purchasing \n40\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nraw materials, ingredients and component parts from disperse geographic regions throughout the world and entering into long-term contracts with some of our tobacco growers and direct material suppliers.  To date, the impact on us of changes in the price, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients and component parts has not been material.  However, the effects of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions on prices, availability and quality of such items may continue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIn addition, government taxes and restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain materials used in our operating companies’ products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.  For example, certain states have passed extended producer responsibility legislation concerning packaging.  Because certain of our products’ packaging consists of single-use plastics, single-use plastic bans and extended producer responsibility mandates could result in bans on some of our product packaging or our products and adversely impact our costs and revenues.  Additional taxes and limitations on the use of certain single-use plastics have been proposed by the U.S. Congress and various state and local governments.  These existing and potential future laws and regulations could increase the costs of, and impair our ability to, source certain materials used in the packaging for our products.\nTiming of Sales\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers, including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events, the timing of promotions, customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs, as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and tax-driven price increases.\nOperating Results\nThe following table provides reconciliations of reported OCI to adjusted OCI for our reportable segments, all other category and total OCI and provides the related OCI margins:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\n(in millions)\nSmokeable Products\nOral Tobacco Products\nAll Other\nTotal\nNet revenues\n$\n21,204\n$\n2,776\n$\n38\n$\n24,018\nExcise taxes\n(3,469)\n(105)\n—\n(3,574)\nRevenues net of excise taxes\n$\n17,735\n$\n2,671\n$\n38\n$\n20,444\nReported OCI\n$\n10,821\n$\n1,449\n$\n(414)\n$\n11,856\nNPM Adjustment Items\n(29)\n—\n—\n(29)\nAsset impairment, exit and implementation costs\n60\n362\n—\n422\nTobacco and health and certain other litigation items\n70\n—\n—\n70\nAdjusted OCI\n$\n10,922\n$\n1,811\n$\n(414)\n$\n12,319\nReported OCI margin \n(1)\n61.0\n \n%\n54.2\n \n%\n(100+)%\n58.0\n \n%\nAdjusted OCI margin \n(1)\n61.6\n \n%\n67.8\n \n%\n(100+)%\n60.3\n \n%\n(1)\n Reported and adjusted OCI margins are calculated as reported and adjusted OCI, respectively, divided by revenues net of excise taxes.\nProgress towards our current U.S. smoke-free portfolio goals are as follows through 2024:\n▪\nU.S. smoke-free volumes of approximately 821 million units, an increase of 2.6% when compared to the 2022 base; and\n▪\nTotal U.S. smoke-free net revenues were $2.8 billion and net revenues from innovative smoke-free products were $0.3 billion.\nAs discussed previously, we are reassessing our U.S. smoke-free goals, and we anticipate providing updated U.S. smoke-free goals when we have more clarity on how the legitimate e-vapor market may evolve.\n41\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nSmokeable Products Segment\nFinancial Results\nThe following table summarizes operating results, includes reported and adjusted OCI margins and provides a reconciliation of reported OCI to adjusted OCI for our smokeable products segment:\nOperating Results\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet revenues\n$\n21,204\n \n$\n21,756 \nExcise taxes\n(3,469)\n(3,869)\nRevenues net of excise taxes\n$\n17,735\n \n$\n17,887 \nReported OCI\n$\n10,821\n \n$\n10,670 \nNPM Adjustment Items\n(29)\n(29)\nAsset impairment, exit and implementation costs\n60\n \n— \nTobacco and health and certain other litigation items\n70\n \n69 \nAdjusted OCI\n$\n10,922\n \n$\n10,710 \nReported OCI margins \n(1)\n61.0\n \n%\n59.7 \n%\nAdjusted OCI margins\n \n(1)\n61.6\n \n%\n59.9 \n%\n(1)\n Reported and adjusted OCI margins are calculated as reported and adjusted OCI, respectively, divided by revenues net of excise taxes.\n2024 Compared with 2023\nNet revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $552 million (2.5%), due primarily to lower shipment volume ($2,528 million), partially offset by higher pricing ($1,968 million), which includes higher promotional investments.\nReported OCI increased $151 million (1.4%), due primarily to higher pricing, which includes higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration and research costs ($56 million),\n partially offset by\n lower shipment volume ($1,648 million), higher per unit settlement charges and manufacturing costs ($198 million) and 2024 exit costs related to the Initiative.\nAdjusted OCI increased $212 million (2.0%), due primarily to higher pricing, which includes higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration and research costs ($86 million), partially offset by lower shipment volume, higher per unit settlement charges and manufacturing costs.\nMarketing, administration and research costs for the smokeable products segment include PM USA’s cost of administering and litigating product liability claims.  Litigation defense costs are influenced by a number of factors, including the number and types of cases filed, the number of cases tried annually, the results of trials and appeals, the development of the law controlling relevant legal issues, and litigation strategy and tactics.  For further discussion on these matters, see Note 20 and Item 3.  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, product liability defense costs for PM USA were $125 million and $133 million, respectively.  The factors that have influenced past product liability costs are expected to continue to influence future costs.  We do not expect future product liability defense costs for our smokeable products segment to be significantly different from product liability defense costs incurred in 2024.\n42\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nShipment Volume and Retail Share Results\nThe following table summarizes our smokeable products segment’s shipment volume performance:\nShipment Volume\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(sticks in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCigarettes:\n     Marlboro\n62,584\n \n68,801 \n     Other premium\n3,186\n \n3,533 \n     Discount\n2,812\n \n4,002 \nTotal cigarettes\n68,582\n \n76,336 \nCigars:\n     Black & Mild\n1,750\n \n1,777 \n     Other\n4\n \n3 \nTotal cigars\n1,754\n \n1,780 \nTotal smokeable products\n70,336\n \n78,116 \nNote: Cigarettes shipment volume includes \nMarlboro\n; Other premium brands, such as \nVirginia Slims\n and \nParliament\n; and Discount brands, which include \nL&M\n and \nBasic.  \nCigarettes volume includes units sold as well as promotional units but excludes units sold for distribution to Puerto Rico, U.S. Territories to overseas military and by Philip Morris Duty Free Inc., none of which, individually or in the aggregate, is material to our smokeable products segment.\nThe following table summarizes our cigarettes retail share performance:\nRetail Share\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCigarettes:\n     Marlboro\n41.7\n \n%\n42.2 \n%\n     Other premium\n2.2\n \n2.3 \n     Discount\n2.0\n \n2.4 \nTotal cigarettes\n45.9\n \n%\n46.9 \n%\nNote: Retail share results for cigarettes are based on data from Circana, LLC (“Circana”), as well as Management Science Associates, Inc.

As a result, we became obligated to make cash payments totaling $250 million under the acquisition agreement, which we made in July 2024.  For further discussion on the NJOY contingent payments, see Note 3\n.\nIn October 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which we may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters \n- As discussed in Note 20, we had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2024.  From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities.  As further discussed in Note 5. \nSupplier Financing \nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement.  In addition, as discussed below in \nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n and in Note 11, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.  These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity.\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings\n - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates.  For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 11.\nPurchase Obligations\n - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business.  Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction.  Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days).  At December 31, 2024, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.8 billion and $2.3 billion thereafter.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $0.9 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business.  The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months.  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and are excluded from the amounts above.\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation\n - PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments.  In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA.  For further discussion of State Settlement Agreements, see \nHealth Care Cost Recovery Litigation \nin Note 20.\nBased on current agreements, estimated annual industry volume decline rates, estimated operating income, estimated market share and inflation, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.0 billion on average for the next three years.  This estimate no longer includes PM USA’s obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to make quarterly payments with respect to settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees due to the termination of these obligations in the fourth quarter of 2024.  In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year.  The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred.  We paid approximately $3.9 billion and $4.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, which are primarily paid in the second quarter of each period.  The payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, market share and inflation.  The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.  For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see \nOperating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment - State Settlement Agreements \nabove.\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments\n - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2024, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $31 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 20, Item 3 and Item 1A.\n48\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nOther Long-Term Liabilities \n- We had $0.9 billion of accrued postretirement health care costs on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and estimate approximately $84 million of annual payments.  In addition, we had accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets.  For further information on our postretirement health care and pension obligations, see Note 18.\nIn October 2024, we entered into an agreement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of a $6.4 billion ordinary loss we recognized in 2023 for cash tax purposes with respect to a portion of our tax basis associated with our former investment in JUUL.  As a result, other liabilities decreased approximately $1.1 billion, which included the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit associated with the $6.4 billion ordinary loss position recognized in 2023, as further discussed in Note 16.\nWe are unable to estimate the timing of payments of other long-term liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\nEquity and Dividends\nDuring 2024, we paid dividends of $6.8 billion, essentially unchanged from 2023, reflecting a higher dividend rate, mostly offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares we repurchased under our share repurchase programs.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, our Board approved a 4.1% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $1.02 per share of our common stock versus the previous rate of $0.98 per share.  Our current annualized dividend rate is $4.08 per share.  Our 2028 Goals include a progressive dividend goal targeting mid-single digits dividend per share growth annually through 2028.  Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of our Board.\nIn March 2024, we increased our $1.0 billion share repurchase program to $3.4 billion and entered into ASR transactions for our common stock.  In the first half of 2024, we paid $2.4 billion for the repurchase of our common stock in the ASR transactions.  We funded the ASR transactions with proceeds from the ABI Transaction.\nFor further discussion of our share repurchase programs, see Note 12 and Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Form 10-K.\nFinancial Review\nCash Provided by/Used in Operating Activities\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 billion compared with $9.3 billion during 2023.  This decrease was due primarily to lower net revenues, payments for certain transferable income tax credits, higher litigation payments and a portion of the NJOY contingent payments ($140 million), partially offset by lower payments for (i) federal excise taxes and (ii) Statement Settlement Agreements, due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume.\nWe had a working capital deficit at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and believe we have the ability to fund working capital deficits with cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and access to the credit and capital markets.\nCash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.2 billion compared with net cash used in investing activities of $1.3 billion during 2023.  This change was due primarily to proceeds from the ABI Transaction in 2024 and the payments for the NJOY Transaction in 2023, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of \nIQOS\n System commercialization rights in 2023.\nCapital expenditures for 2024 decreased 27.6% to $142 million.  We expect capital expenditures for 2025 to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million, which are expected to be funded from operating cash flows.\nCash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities\nDuring 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $11.5 billion compared with $8.4 billion during 2023.  This increase was due primarily to higher share repurchases in 2024, issuance of long-term debt in 2023 and a portion of the NJOY contingent payments ($110 million), partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt in 2024.\nNew Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 2\n \nfor a discussion of issued accounting guidance applicable to, but not yet adopted by, us.\nContingencies\nSee Note 20 and Item 3 for a discussion of contingencies.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nPM USA (“Guarantor”), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Parent”), has guaranteed the Parent’s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (“Guarantees”).  Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the \n49\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\npayment and performance of the Parent’s obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (“Obligations”), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations.  The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n▪\nreceived less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n▪\neither:\n▪\nwas insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n▪\nwas engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n▪\nintended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing.  Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n▪\nthe sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n▪\nthe present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n▪\nit could not pay its debts as they become due.\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees.  For this purpose, “Bankruptcy Law” means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n▪\nthe date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n▪\nthe date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n▪\nthe payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n▪\nthe rating of the Parent’s long-term senior unsecured debt by S&P of A or higher.\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt (“Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”) are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.\n50\nT\nable \nof\n Contents\nThe following tables include summarized financial information for the Parent and the Guarantor.  Transactions between the Parent and the Guarantor (including investment and intercompany balances as well as equity earnings) have been eliminated.  The Parent’s and the Guarantor’s intercompany balances with Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries have been presented separately.
