Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; global LNG developments; oil sands in Canada; and an inventory of global exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at September 30, 2025, we employed approximately 11,400 people worldwide and had total assets of $122 billion.\nOverview\nAt ConocoPhillips, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile, and our view is that a successful business strategy in the E&P industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. As such, we are unhedged, remain committed to our disciplined investment framework and continually monitor market fundamentals, including the impacts associated with geopolitical tensions and conflicts, global demand for our products, oil and gas inventory levels, governmental policies, tariffs, inflation and supply chain disruptions.\nThroughout 2025, the price of crude oil has been volatile due to multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical forces which slowed global oil demand growth concurrent with higher oil production from OPEC Plus and other major oil producing countries. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, including any impacts from tariffs, and the ongoing market volatility in the energy landscape and across global markets for implications to our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nAs the global energy industry continues to evolve, we remain committed to creating long-term value for our stockholders. We believe ConocoPhillips plays an essential role in responsibly meeting the global demand for energy, while continuing to deliver competitive returns on and of capital and working to meet our previously established emissions-reduction targets. Our value proposition to deliver competitive returns to stockholders through price cycles is guided by our foundational principles which consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance.\n33\nConocoPhillips      2025 Q3 10-Q\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation (Marathon Oil). In the first half of 2025, we completed the asset integration of Marathon Oil and remain on track for more than $1 billion of synergies on a run-rate basis by year-end 2025 and over $1 billion of one-time benefits. These one-time benefits include $0.5 billion recognized previously upon close of the transaction related to the utilization of foreign tax credits, with the remainder consisting of net operating losses expected to be realized in future periods. In August 2025, we announced incremental cost reductions and margin enhancements of more than $1 billion anticipated on a run-rate basis by year-end 2026. We expect approximately $0.8 billion to consist of G&A reductions, lease operating cost improvements and opportunities in transportation and processing and approximately $0.2 billion to be achieved through margin expansion. \nSee Note 3.\n \nIn conjunction with our acquisition of Marathon Oil, we communicated a disposition proceeds target of $2 billion across the portfolio. In August 2025, we announced an increase to this target for a total of $5 billion by year-end 2026. ConocoPhillips has executed dispositions of over $3 billion in 2025 and is on track to meet its $5 billion disposition target by year-end 2026. On October 1, 2025, the company closed the disposition of Lower 48 assets in the Anadarko Basin for $1.3 billion. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2025, the sale of certain noncore assets closed or expect to close for approximately $0.5 billion, subject to customary closing adjustments. \nSee Note 3.\n \nIn August 2025, we entered into a 20-year agreement, expected to begin in 2030, to purchase four MTPA of LNG offtake from Phase 2 of the Port Arthur LNG project, further advancing our global LNG portfolio strategy. Additionally, in August 2025, we entered into a 20-year agreement to purchase one MTPA of LNG offtake from the Rio Grande LNG Train 5 facility, expected to begin in 2031, bringing our total committed commercial LNG offtake portfolio to approximately 10 MTPA.\nThe relevant provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), enacted on July 4, 2025, were implemented during the third quarter of 2025. While OBBBA did not have a material effect on our effective tax rate for the quarter, the changes introduced by the legislation impacted our current and deferred tax calculations, with approximately $0.4 billion cash tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2025 and the remaining approximately $0.1 billion to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nIn November 2025, we declared an increase to our quarterly ordinary dividend from $0.78 per share to $0.84 per share, representing an eight percent increase. \nProduction was 2,399 MBOED in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 482 MBOED from the same period a year ago. After adjusting for impacts from closed acquisitions and dispositions, third-quarter\n \n2025 production increased by 83 MBOED or four percent from the same period a year ago.\nThird-quarter 2025 production resulted in $5.9 billion of cash provided by operating activities. We returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders, consisting of $1.3 billion through share repurchases and $1.0 billion through our ordinary dividend. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaling $6.6 billion and long-term investments in debt securities of $1.1 billion.\nAlso in the third quarter of 2025, we re-invested $2.9 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and investments, with over half of the expenditures related to flexible, short-cycle unconventional plays in the Lower 48 segment, where our production has access to both domestic and export markets. \nConocoPhillips      2025 Q3 10-Q\n34\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Environment\nCommodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related returns on and of capital to our shareholders. Dynamics that could influence world energy markets and commodity prices include, but are not limited to, global economic health, supply or demand disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest, global pandemics, military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC Plus and other major oil producing countries, environmental laws, tariffs, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the financial, operational and ESG priorities that underpin our value proposition.\nOur earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with price levels for crude oil and natural gas, which are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control. The following graph depicts the trend in average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas:\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $69.07 per barrel in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of 14 percent compared with $80.18 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024. WTI at Cushing crude oil prices averaged $64.93 per barrel in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of 14 percent compared with $75.10 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024. Oil prices were lower in the third quarter of 2025 as global oil supplies increased faster than global oil demand.\nU.S. Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $3.07 per MMBTU in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 43 percent compared with $2.15 per MMBTU in the third quarter of 2024. U.S. Henry Hub prices improved due to stronger demand and lower inventory levels versus the same time last year. We expect a risk of volatility in regional markers to remain throughout 2025. \nOur realized bitumen price averaged $41.58 per barrel in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of 12 percent compared with $47.32 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in the third quarter of 2025 was driven by falling WTI prices due to concerns over a slowdown in global trade and OPEC Plus increasing production targets, partly offset by strengthened WCS differentials due to additional egress capacity at the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion. \nFor the third quarter of 2025, our total average realized price was $46.44 per BOE, a decrease of 14 percent compared with $54.18 per BOE in the third quarter of 2024.\n35\nConocoPhillips      2025 Q3 10-Q\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTable of Contents\nKey Operating and Financial Summary\n•\nReported third-quarter 2025 earnings per share of $1.38;\n•\nGenerated cash provided by operating activities of $5.9 billion;\n•\nRaised ordinary dividend by 8% to $0.84 per share; \n•\nDelivered total company and Lower 48 production of 2,399 MBOED and 1,528 MBOED, respectively;\n•\nExceeded $3 billion in dispositions in 2025 and on track to meet $5 billion disposition target by year-end 2026; \n•\nAdvanced commercial LNG strategy by signing 20-year sales and purchase agreements at PALNG Phase 2 and Rio Grande LNG Train 5, expected to commence in 2030 and 2031, respectively;\n•\nDistributed over $2.2 billion to shareholders, including $1.3 billion through share repurchases and $1.0 billion through the ordinary dividend; and\n•\nEnded the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $6.6 billion and long-term investments of $1.1 billion. \nOutlook\nProduction\nFourth-quarter 2025 production is expected to be 2.30 to 2.34 MMBOED. \nFull-year production guidance has been raised to 2.375 MMBOED, compared to prior guidance of 2.35 to 2.37 MMBOED.\nAll other guidance remains unchanged.

Decreases to earnings also included higher production and operating expenses of $30 million, driven by a severance accrual related to certain announced cost reduction initiatives. \nSee Note 15.\nEarnings in the nine-month period of 2025 included lower sales revenues resulting from lower realized prices of $383 million, partly offset by higher produced volumes of $90 million. Earnings decreases in the nine-month period of 2025 also included higher production and operating expenses of $90 million, driven by higher lease operating expenses and well work activity and a severance accrual related to certain announced cost reduction initiatives, and higher DD&A of $63 million, primarily driven by higher rates and higher production. \nSee Note 15. \nIncreases to earnings included lower taxes other than income taxes of $34 million driven by an impact from the settlement of a contingent matter. \nProduction\nAverage production remained flat in the three-month period and increased seven MBOED in the nine-month period of 2025, compared to the respective periods in 2024.

During the first nine months of 2025, the primary uses of our available cash were $9.5 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, $4.0 billion to repurchase common stock, $3.0 billion to pay the ordinary dividend and $0.9 billion to retire debt at maturity, partly offset by proceeds from noncore asset sales of $1.6 billion.\nAt September 30, 2025, we had total liquidity of $11.8 billion, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $5.3 billion, short-term investments of $1.0 billion and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $5.5 billion. In addition, we have $1.1 billion of long-term investments in debt securities. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operating activities, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Changes in Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, acquisitions, dividend payments and debt obligations.\nSignificant Changes in Capital\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $15.5 billion for the first nine months of 2025 compared with $15.7 billion for the corresponding period of 2024. The decrease resulted from lower commodity prices and tax payment timing, mostly offset by operations from the 2024 Marathon acquisition. \nOur short-term and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent on the prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile, driven by market conditions beyond our control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.\nThe level of absolute production volumes, as well as the product and location mix, is another significant factor impacting our cash flows. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; government regulations; impacts of a global pandemic; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively monitor and manage these factors, changes in production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although we generally experience less variability in our cash flows due to changes in production levels than due to changes in commodity prices.\nTo maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue adding to our proved reserve base. See the \n“Capital Expenditures and Investments”\n \nsection.\nConocoPhillips      2025 Q3 10-Q\n48\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nTable of Contents\nInvesting Activities\nFor the first nine months of 2025, we invested $9.5 billion in capital expenditures and investments. Our 2025 operating plan capital expenditures are currently expected to be $12.3 billion to $12.6 billion. Our 2024 capital expenditures and investments were $12.1 billion. See the \n“Capital Expenditures and Investments”\n section. \nIn the first nine months of 2025, net cash used in investing activities was impacted by an increase in working capital changes associated with investing activities of $488 million, due to timing of invoice payments.\nProceeds from asset sales were $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2025 compared with $0.2 billion for the corresponding period in 2024. We received proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion from the sale of assets in our Lower 48 segment and $0.1 billion from real estate asset sales in our Corporate segment. \nSee Note \n3\n.\nIn July 2025, we signed an agreement to divest Lower 48 assets in the Anadarko Basin. The $1.3 billion transaction closed on October 1, 2025. \nSee Note \n3\n.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, we closed or expect to close dispositions of certain noncore Lower 48 assets for approximately $0.5 billion, subject to customary closing adjustments. \nS\nee Note \n3\n.\nWe invest in short-term and long-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity, and provide yield and total returns. These investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. Short-term funds needed to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities of less than one year. Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer-term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities of greater than one year. \nSee Note 10.\nInvesting activities in the first nine months of 2025 included net purchases of $556 million of investments. We had net purchases of $94 million of short-term investments and net purchases of $462 million of long-term investments\n. \nSee Note \n13.\nFinancing Activities\nIn February 2025, we refinanced our revolving credit facility maintaining a total aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion and extended the expiration to February 2030. The credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million or as support for our commercial paper program. With no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $5.5 billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at September 30, 2025.\nOur debt balance at September 30, 2025, was $23.5 billion compared with $24.3 billion at December 31, 2024. The current portion of debt, including future payments for finance leases, is $1.0 billion at September 30, 2025. In the second quarter of 2025, the company retired $0.2 billion principal amount of our 3.35% Notes at maturity. In the first quarter of 2025, the company retired $0.5 billion principal amount of debt at maturity, consisting of $0.4 billion of our 2.4% Notes and $0.1 billion of our 8.2% Debentures. Debt payments are expected to be made using current cash balances and cash provided by operating activities. \nThe current long-term debt credit ratings are:\n•\nFitch: “A” with a “stable” outlook\n•\nS&P: “A-” with a “stable” outlook\n•\nMoody's: “A2” with a \n\"\nstable\n\"\n outlook\nSee Note \n5 \nfor additional information on debt and the revolving credit facility.\nCertain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we had direct bank letters of credit of $243 million and $278 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.\n49\nConocoPhillips      2025 Q3 10-Q\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nTable of Contents\nShelf Registration\nWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate number of various types of debt and equity securities.\nCapital Requirements\nFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the \n“\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\n” \nsection. \nWe believe in delivering value to our shareholders through our return of capital framework. The framework is structured to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases. We anticipate returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities through cycles.\nIn the first nine months of 2025, we paid ordinary dividends of $2.34 per share and in the first nine months of 2024, we paid ordinary dividends of $1.74 per share and VROC payments of $0.60 per share. \nIn November 2025, we declared an increase to our quarterly ordinary dividend from $0.78 per share to $0.84 per share, representing an eight percent increase. The dividend is payable December 1, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2025.\nIn late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase from our prior authorization of $45 billion by a total of the lesser of $20 billion or the number of shares issued in our acquisition of Marathon Oil, such that the company is not to exceed $65 billion in aggregate purchases. Share repurchases are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of September 30, 2025, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 474.8 million shares and $38.3 billion. In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 42.2 million shares for a cost of $4.0 billion. \nSee Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors –\n “\nOur ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations\n” in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nMillions of Dollars\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n2025\n2024\nAlaska\n$\n2,785\n \n2,102 \nLower 48\n5,089\n \n4,918 \nCanada\n461\n \n419 \nEurope, Middle East and North Africa\n923\n \n694 \nAsia Pacific\n188\n \n235 \nCorporate and Other\n84\n \n433 \nCapital expenditures and investments\n$\n9,530\n \n8,801 \nDuring the first nine months of 2025, capital expenditures and investments supported key operating activities and acquisitions, primarily:\n•\nAppraisal and development activities in Alaska related to the Western North Slope, inclusive of Willow, and development activities in the Greater Kuparuk Area.\n•\nDevelopment activities in the Lower 48, primarily in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken.\n•\nAppraisal and development activities in the Montney as well as development and optimization of Surmont in Canada.\n•\nDevelopment and appraisal activities across assets in Norway and development activities in Libya.\n•\nContinued development activities in China.\n•\nInvestments in our global LNG operations.\nOur 2025 operating plan capital expenditure guidance is currently expected to be $12.3 billion to $12.6 billion.

Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations and climate change. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the U.S. EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under the CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operations. As of September 30, 2025, there were 16 sites around the U.S. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. For remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada, our consolidated balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $210 million at September 30, 2025, compared with $206 million at December 31, 2024. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.\nClimate Change\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction. These laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. \nCompany Response to Climate-Related Risks\nThe objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, emissions reduction technologies, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. The strategy guides our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets, incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.\nOur Climate Risk Strategy is intended to enable us to responsibly meet the global demand for energy, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and work to meet our operational emissions-reduction targets. First, meeting global energy demand requires a focus on delivering production that will best compete in any energy demand scenario. This production will be delivered from resources with a competitive cost of supply and low GHG intensity, as well as portfolio diversity by market and asset type. Next, our focus is on delivering superior returns through the cycles based on our foundational principles of balance sheet strength, peer-leading distributions and disciplined investments. Finally, to drive accountability for the emissions that are within our ownership, we are progressing toward our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity targets.\nConocoPhillips      2025 Q3 10-Q\n52\nTable of Contents\nCautionary Statement for the Purposes of the “Safe Harbor” Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
