  "item1": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.\nOverview\nUnited Airlines Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, \"UAL\" or the \"Company\") is a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, \"United\"). United's shared purpose is \"Connecting People. Uniting the World.\" United has the most comprehensive route network among North American carriers, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. \nAs UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United's operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL's revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL's assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" and the \"Company\" in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.\nThe Company's principal executive office is located at 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 (telephone number (872) 825-4000). The Company's website is located at www.united.com and its investor relations website is located at ir.united.com. The information contained on or connected to the Company's websites is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The Company's filings with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, as well as UAL's proxy statement for its annual meeting of stockholders, are accessible without charge on the Company's investor relations website, as soon as reasonably practicable, after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Such filings are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. \nOperations\nThe Company transports people and cargo throughout North America and to destinations in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates across six continents, with hubs at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (\"ORD\"), Denver International Airport (\"DEN\"), George Bush Intercontinental Airport (\"IAH\"), Los Angeles International Airport (\"LAX\"), Newark Liberty International Airport (\"EWR\"), San Francisco International Airport (\"SFO\"), Washington Dulles International Airport (\"IAD\") and A.B. Won Pat International Airport (\"GUM\"). \nAll of the Company's domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers, contributing to a large amount of \"origin and destination\" traffic. The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly. The hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the world's largest alliance network.\nUnited Next. \nIn 2024 the Company continued to make progress with its United Next plan to align its network and product with the potential of its hubs while remaining focused on protecting the safety of its employees and customers and providing a superior customer experience. United Next aims to increase customer choice and win brand-loyal customers by offering a diversity of products ranging from Basic Economy to Polaris and growing our leading global network, which the Company believes will lead to diverse revenue streams for the Company. As part of its United Next growth plan, the Company expects to \n3\nTable of Contents\ntake delivery of over 660 new narrow- and widebody aircraft by the end of 2033. The new aircraft that the Company has taken delivery of to date have increased the Company's gauge, scale and connectivity as well as improved the Company's fuel efficiency. Other key highlights of its United Next plan include:\n•\nincreasing our employee headcount by more than 30,000 employees since 2020;\n•\nsurpassing 300 new and retrofit aircraft featuring United's signature interior with bigger bins, seatback screens at every seat and Bluetooth connectivity;\n•\nexpanding the Company's leading global network to destinations like Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Nuuk, Greenland; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Palermo, Italy; Bilbao, Spain; Faro, Portugal; Madeira Island, Portugal; Puerto Escondido, Mexico; and Dakar, Senegal;\n•\nlaunching Kinective Media\nSM\n (the first media network that uses insights from travel behaviors to connect customers to personalized advertising, experiences and offers from leading brands);\n•\nannouncing an industry-leading agreement with SpaceX to bring Starlink's Wi-Fi service (the world's fastest, most reliable Wi-Fi in the sky) to our aircraft; and\n•\nmaking significant technology changes that empower the Company's employees and improve the customer experience.\nRegional.\n The Company's business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network, with regional capacity accounting for approximately 6% of the Company's total capacity for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our hubs and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. CommuteAir LLC (\"CommuteAir\"), GoJet Airlines LLC (\"GoJet\"), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (\"Mesa\"), Republic Airways Inc. (\"Republic\") and SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (\"SkyWest\") are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (\"CPAs\"). Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable rate adjustment based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual adjustments. The fees are based on specific rates multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), as well as fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is also responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In some cases, the Company owns some or all of the aircraft subject to the CPA and leases such aircraft to the regional carrier. In return, the regional carriers operate the capacity of the aircraft included within the scope of such CPA exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus loyalty program.\nAlliances.\n United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. In 2024, Star Alliance carriers continued to serve more than 1,200 airports in 195 countries and territories with over 17,000 average daily departures. Star Alliance members, in addition to United, are Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways (\"ANA\"), Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Aerovías del Continente Americano (Avianca), Brussels Airlines, Copa Airlines, Croatia Airlines, EGYPTAIR, Ethiopian Airlines, EVA Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, SWISS, TAP Air Portugal, THAI Airways International and Turkish Airlines. In addition to its members, Star Alliance includes Shanghai-based Juneyao Airlines as a connecting partner and Germany-based Deutsche Bahn, a rail company, as an intermodal partner.\nUnited has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with Star Alliance members, addressing, among other things, reciprocal earning and redemption of frequent flyer miles, access to airport lounges and, with certain Star Alliance members, codesharing of flight operations (whereby one carrier's selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier). In addition to the alliance agreements with Star Alliance members, United currently maintains independent alliance agreements with other air carriers, including Aer Lingus, Air Dolomiti, Airlink, Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras, Cape Air, Discover Airlines, Emirates, Eurowings, flydubai, Hawaiian Airlines, JetSuiteX, Olympic Air, Silver Airways and Virgin Australia Airlines. \nUnited also participates in four passenger joint business arrangements (\"JBAs\"): one with Air Canada and the Lufthansa Group (which includes Lufthansa and its affiliates Air Dolomiti, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Discover Airlines, Edelweiss, Eurowings and SWISS) covering transatlantic routes, one with ANA covering certain transpacific routes, one with Air New Zealand covering certain routes between the United States and New Zealand, and one with Air Canada covering certain United States and Canada transborder routes. These passenger JBAs enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they \n4\nTable of Contents\nprovide in the respective regions, capturing revenue synergies and delivering enhanced customer benefits, such as highly competitive flight schedules, fares and services. Separate from the passenger JBAs, United is also a party to a JBA with Lufthansa for transatlantic cargo services. This cargo JBA offers expanded and more seamless access to cargo space across the carriers' respective combined networks.\nLoyalty Program.\n United's MileagePlus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards, benefits and services to program participants. Members in this program earn miles for flights on United, United Express, Star Alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Members can also earn miles by purchasing goods and services from our network of non-airline partners, such as domestic and international credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels and car rental companies. Members can redeem miles for free (other than taxes and government-imposed fees), discounted or upgraded travel and non-travel awards.\nUnited has an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"Chase\"), pursuant to which members of United's MileagePlus loyalty program who are residents of the United States can earn miles for making purchases using a MileagePlus credit card issued by Chase (the \"Co-Brand Agreement\"). The Co-Brand Agreement also provides for joint marketing and other support for the MileagePlus credit card and provides Chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the Company's customer database.\nIn 2024, approximately 9.2 million MileagePlus flight awards were used on United and United Express. These awards represented approximately 9% of United's total revenue passenger miles. Total miles redeemed for flights on United and United Express, including class-of-service upgrades, represented approximately 93% of the total miles redeemed. In addition, excluding miles redeemed for flights on United and United Express, MileagePlus members redeemed miles for approximately 3.7 million other awards. These awards include United Club memberships, car and hotel awards, merchandise and flights on other air carriers.\nAir Cargo.\n The Company provides freight and mail transportation services (\"Air Cargo\"). The majority of Air Cargo services are provided to commercial businesses, freight forwarders, logistics firms and national postal services. Through our global network, the Company's Air Cargo operations are able to connect the world's major freight gateways. The Company generates Air Cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo capacity on regularly scheduled passenger flights, interline and charter flights, and ground trucking arrangements.\nDistribution Channels.\n The Company's airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the Company's direct channels, traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies (\"OTA\"). The use of the Company's direct sales website, www.united.com, the Company's mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the Company with an opportunity to de-commoditize its services, better present its content, make more targeted offerings, better retain its customers, enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs. Agency sales are primarily sold using global distribution systems (\"GDS\"). United has developed and expects to continue to develop capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the GDS channel to provide an enhanced buying experience for customers who purchase in that channel. \nThird-Party Business. \nUnited generates third-party business revenue that includes maintenance services, frequent flyer award non-travel redemptions, flight academy and ground handling. \nAircraft Fuel.\n The table below summarizes the fuel consumption and expense of UAL's aircraft (including the operations of our regional carriers operating under CPAs) during the last three years. \nYear\nGallons Consumed\n(in millions)\nFuel Expense\n(in millions)\nAverage Price Per Gallon\nPercentage of Total Operating Expense\n2024\n4,444 \n$\n11,756 \n$\n2.65 \n23 \n%\n2023\n4,205 \n$\n12,651 \n$\n3.01 \n26 \n%\n2022\n3,608 \n$\n13,113 \n$\n3.63 \n31 \n%\nOur operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. The Company routinely enters into purchase contracts based on expected fuel requirements for UAL aircraft (including regional carriers operating under CPAs) that are generally indexed to various market price benchmarks for aircraft fuel. These contracts customarily do not provide material protection against changes in market prices or guarantee the uninterrupted availability of adequate quantities of aircraft fuel. The price of aircraft fuel used by our operations has fluctuated substantially in the past \n5\nTable of Contents\nseveral years. The Company's current strategy is to not enter into financial transactions to hedge the market price exposure of its expected fuel consumption, although the Company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors.\nIndustry Conditions\nDomestic Competition.\n The domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic. The Company's competitors consist primarily of other airlines and, to a certain extent, other forms of transportation. Currently, any U.S. carrier deemed fit by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the \"DOT\") is largely free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the United States. Competition can be direct, in the form of another carrier flying the exact non-stop route, or indirect, where a carrier serves the same two cities non-stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport. Air carriers' cost structures are not uniform and are influenced by numerous factors. Carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers, which could have a potential negative impact on the Company's revenues. Domestic pricing decisions are impacted by intense competitive pressure exerted on the Company by other U.S. airlines. In order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels, we often find it necessary to match competitors' discounted fares.\nInternational Competition.\n Internationally, the Company competes not only with U.S. airlines, but also with foreign carriers. International competition has increased and may continue to increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions, JBAs, alliances, restructurings, liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors. Competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation. The Company's ability to compete successfully with non-U.S. carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire United States via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide. Foreign carriers currently are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying local passengers between two points in the United States and the Company generally experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries. Separately, \"fifth freedom rights\" allow the Company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the U.S. and another foreign country. In the absence of fifth freedom rights, or some other extra-bilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries, U.S. carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities. To compensate partially for these structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into alliances, immunized JBAs and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other's flights and route networks. Through these arrangements, the Company strives to provide consumers with a growing number of seamless, cost-effective and convenient travel options. See \"Alliances\" for additional information.\nSeasonality.\n The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters, driving higher revenues, than in the first and fourth quarters, which are periods of lower travel demand.\nOur Approach to Corporate Citizenship and Value Creation\nAt United \"Good Leads the Way\" is more than a slogan; it fuels our mission to build the world's biggest and best airline. Our employees around the world are joined together to enable connections that matter and move society—whether it is connecting people across cultures, flying a loved one to a wedding, connecting medical professionals at a breakthrough conference or getting a business traveler to an important meeting or back home in time for a child's big game. \nToday United is viewed not only as a leader among our peer airlines but as a leader among the world's largest corporations. Our leadership is driven by our desire to blaze new trails by being a force for good, responsive to the world in which we operate, responsible for our actions and committed to doing the right thing. United has devoted its brand, reputation, resources, time and effort to pursuing corporate citizenship goals aimed to generate the most impactful results that we can create. Simply, we aspire to use our influence and scale to lead in a way that inspires the world to action. Over the last few years, we have made historic investments to fight climate change and provided career opportunities to thousands of people.\nWe set forth below three of our corporate citizenship focus areas.\nSafety Culture\nAt United, safety is first in everything we do and is our first service standard of Core4 (we are safe, then caring, dependable and efficient). We are focused on promoting our safety culture to help ensure that every employee across United holds each other to the highest safety standards. Our \"No Small Roles in Safety\" strategy as part of our Safety Management System (\"SMS\") is designed to imbue every employee with an understanding of his or her significant responsibility in our collective ambition to ensure the highest level of safety performance for our customers and employees. Our laser focus on safety is not only essential to our success but also foundational to our culture.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to evaluate and expand our SMS to incorporate new areas of the business to manage risk as we navigate this exciting time at United with the growth in our aircraft fleet and the increasing number of destinations that we plan to serve. Our continuously evolving SMS allows us to proactively identify hazards and mitigate risks to help ensure the safety of our customers and our employees as we grow. In addition, just as we have invested in infrastructure, technology and tools, we are also investing in the training and development of our employees, especially those who are new to United, to help ensure they gain proficiency in their roles and stay safe in the workplace.\nOur approach to safety is centered around three components:\n1.\nUnited SMS\n: Continuously investing in infrastructure, technology, tools, voluntary safety reporting and training that are built among the key components of our safety policy, safety risk management, safety assurance and safety promotion.\n2.\nSafety in Action\n: Improving safety through development of robust, proactive safety programs and standards.\n3.\nSafety Data and Innovation\n: Identifying and mitigating safety hazards through strong data analytics and new technologies and processes.\nEnvironmental Sustainability Strategy\nThe Company's commitment to operating an environmentally sustainable airline is woven into its long-term strategy. The Company believes that it is critical to continue to serve its purpose of connecting people and uniting the world and is focused on finding actionable solutions that reduce the environmental impact of its operations and manage operational costs in its energy supply while also achieving its financial goals and creating long-term value for its stockholders. At the end of 2020, the Company pledged a net zero goal to reduce its greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions by 100% by 2050 without relying on the use of voluntary, traditional carbon offsets\n1\n. The Company also established a mid-term target of reducing, compared to 2019, its carbon emissions intensity by 50% by 2035. This intensity target is intended to align to the Company's net zero goal.\nThe Company believes that innovative technologies can assist the Company with achieving its climate goals, enhance the customer experience and improve its operations. Our second largest operating expense, conventional jet fuel, is subject to volatile global prices. Reducing our fuel consumption while diversifying our fuel supply with sustainable aviation fuel (\"SAF\") can enhance our resiliency in the face of conventional jet fuel price spikes.\nThe Company's sustainability strategy is centered around four key pathways, each of which is described in further detail below: (i) emitting less GHGs; (ii) adopting more sustainable alternatives to conventional jet fuel; (iii) making improvements to its operations beyond its flights; and (iv) collaborating with employees, customers, airports, suppliers, cross-industry partners and policymakers to facilitate faster action and commercializing relevant technology. The Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), including through its Public Responsibility Committee, provides oversight of its environmental sustainability and climate-related strategic goals and objectives to ensure integration with its core business strategy. Management periodically updates the Board on the implementation of the Company's climate-related strategic goals and objectives. The Board, including through its Public Responsibility Committee, also oversees management's identification, evaluation and monitoring of environmental (including climate-related) trends, issues, concerns, risks and opportunities that affect or could affect the Company's reputation, business activities, strategies and performance.\n•\nEmitting Less GHGs\n: As part of this plan, the Company is focused on improving fuel efficiency in its operations. Its main focus in realizing this objective is reducing its conventional jet fuel consumption, which is both the largest contributor to its environmental footprint and, as noted above, a sizable expense for the Company. To do so, the Company is prioritizing the introduction of newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft into its fleet as part of its United Next plan as well as improving the fuel efficiency of its existing fleet. In conjunction with improving the fuel efficiency of its fleet, the Company has been incorporating fuel efficiency considerations within flight and ground operations, including implementing operational and procedural initiatives designed to drive fuel conservation. The Company has worked collaboratively across its organization and with Air Traffic Control (\"ATC\") providers to strive to improve fuel efficiency through the implementation of best practices and by training its pilots and dispatchers and supplying them with the necessary tools to execute those strategies.\n1\n Traditional carbon offsets refer to carbon credits generated through the avoidance and/or reduction of CO2 emissions that would have otherwise occurred outside a company's value chain. Traditional carbon offsets do not include certificates conveying the attributes of renewable energy or sustainable aviation fuel, or credits related to the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.\n7\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the Company, through the aerospace-focused investment vertical of its corporate venture capital arm, United Airlines Ventures, Ltd. (\"UAV\"), has been collaborating with, as well as investing in, early-stage technology companies that focus on lower carbon alternative propulsion technologies. \n•\nAdopting More Sustainable Alternatives to Conventional Jet Fuel\n: We believe that large-scale adoption of SAF in our operations is critical to helping mitigate our exposure to volatile fuel prices and achieving our climate goals. SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel and its potential to scale is due to its 'drop-in' readiness, which means it can be used in current operations with existing aircraft and infrastructure with few to no additional alterations required. The Company is working with strategic partners to scale, employ and commercialize the use of SAF.\nWhile the Company currently is an aviation leader in investing in technologies focused on decarbonizing aviation and its associated energy supply chains, SAF supply in the jet fuel market is constrained and represents, according to industry estimates, less than 1% of global commercial aviation fuel usage. Additionally, the purchase of SAF today comes with a price premium, compared to conventional jet fuel, to account for the additional costs of scaling and producing this early-stage solution. As a result, in 2024, the total volume of SAF used in the Company's operations remained less than 0.3% of its total aviation fuel usage. These challenges with present-day SAF have informed the Company's strategy of investing in technology to help scale the SAF market and unlock future supply for the Company.\nThe Company has an established history in the investment in, and use of, SAF. Beginning in 2015, the Company made its first investment in a company working to commercialize SAF production. In 2016, the Company became the first airline globally to start using SAF in its regular operations on an ongoing basis at various airports. The Company has progressed its SAF strategy with several notable milestones, including the following:\n◦\nIn 2021 the Company launched its first-of-its-kind Eco-Skies Alliance program for corporations to help advance the SAF market by working with the Company to fund the price premium for SAF. The Company also established UAV, a corporate venture capital arm that seeks to invest in promising sustainable aviation technologies and innovation to usher in the future of air travel.\n◦\nIn 2022 the Company signed a purchase agreement with Neste for up to 52.5 million gallons of SAF at domestic and international stations, becoming the first U.S. airline to execute an international purchase agreement for SAF.\n◦\nIn 2023 the Company launched, through UAV, the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund (the \"Fund\") to support start-ups developing technologies focused on decarbonizing aviation and its associated energy supply chains, including through research and production, and technologies associated with SAF.\n◦\nIn 2024, the Company became the first airline to purchase SAF for use at ORD, signing agreements with two suppliers.\n•\nImproving Our Operations Beyond Our Flights\n:\n The Company is focused on initiatives intended to drive more sustainable operations while maintaining efficiencies across the business. For example, United continues to progress its strategic electrification of ground service equipment (\"GSE\") across its hubs and stations. As of the end of 2024, over 5,070 units of the Company's GSE around the world are electric, representing approximately 38% of its GSE fleet.\n•\nCollaborating with Partners\n: The Company collaborates with employees, customers, airports, suppliers, cross-industry partners, trade associations and policymakers across its value chain to scale the supply of SAF and invest in decarbonization technology solutions. Some of the Company's highlights in this area include the following:\n◦\nThe Company worked with federal policymakers to champion passage of new SAF tax incentives in 2022. These credits create an economic incentive for increased SAF production within the United States.\n◦\nThe Company led a cross-sectoral effort to incentivize SAF in Illinois, lowering the overall cost of SAF consumption at the state level. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Purchase Credit was enacted in Illinois in February 2023 and became effective in mid-2023. The Company was the first airline to use this credit for purchases in 2024.\n◦\nThe Company is a founding member of the nonprofit, non-partisan SAF Coalition. Formed in 2024, the SAF Coalition is an organization looking to bring together all stakeholders of the aviation fuel value chain to advocate for federal policies that support and increase domestic SAF production. \n8\nTable of Contents\nIn 2023, the Company evolved its GHG reporting to align with corporate best practices around GHG accounting protocols, including anticipated updates in accounting guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This revised reporting methodology allows us to provide greater transparency around the aircraft's GHG emissions from burning conventional jet fuel and SAF. Biogenic GHG emissions from SAF are not reported as Scope 1-3 emissions. \nThe Company believes that its absolute GHG emissions will continue to increase in the immediate future as the Company continues to grow. In addition, even though purchasing voluntary, traditional carbon offsets could present near-term emissions reductions, as outlined above, the Company aims to achieve its mid-term and long-term climate goals without relying on the use of voluntary, traditional carbon offsets. Such commitment is demonstrated by the end of the Company's customer offset program and elimination of emission reductions realized by carbon offsets as reflected in its GHG inventory. Additional quantitative emissions data for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 are as follows: \nCarbon Emissions\n2023\n2022\nDirect (Scope 1) GHG Emissions in Metric Tons CO\n2\ne\nGross and Net GHG emissions\n36,590,472\n30,400,715\nBiogenic Emissions in Metric Tons CO\n2\ne\nBiogenic (Outside of Scope) Emissions\n67,395\n26,806\nIndirect Emissions in Metric Tons CO\n2\ne\nIndirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions\n144,019\n149,252\nOther indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions (a)\n12,671,510\n13,343,676\nTotal Net GHG Emissions in Metric Tons CO\n2\ne (b)\n49,406,001\n43,893,642\nCarbon Emissions Intensity Rates (c)\n2023\n2022\nEmissions Intensity per Revenue ton-kilometer (\"RTK\")\nMainline RTKs (millions) (d)\n46,361\n39,526\nMetric tons CO\n2\ne/1,000 mainline and regional RTKs (e)\n1,057\n1,098\nEmissions Intensity per ASM\nASMs (millions) (f)\n291,333\n247,858\nMetric tons CO\n2\ne/1,000 mainline and regional ASMs (g)\n169\n176\n(a)\nIncludes Scope 3 categories 3, 4, 7, 14 and 15.\n(b)\nExcludes biogenic emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n(c)\nIntensity rates and operational figures are calculated based on third-party verified data for 2023 and 2022.\n(d)\nThe number of mainline revenue (passenger and cargo) tons transported multiplied by the number of kilometers flown on each segment.\n(e)\nScope 1+2 and Scope 3 (categories 3 and 4) emissions/mainline+regional RTKs; metric used for tracking progress against the Company's 2035 carbon emissions intensity goal and 2050 carbon emission goal.\n(f)\nThe number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of scheduled miles those seats are flown.\n(g)\nScope 1+2 and Scope 3 (categories 3, 4, 7 and 14) emissions/mainline+regional ASMs.\nAdditional information on United's commitment to environmental sustainability is available at united.com/sustainability.

O\nur executive team \nprovides several avenues of engagement to inform\n our employee needs globally. We routinely conduct employee engagement surveys of our global workforce, which provide feedback on employee satisfaction and cover a variety of topics such as company culture, safety and values, execution of our strategy and individual development, among others.\n3.\nRobust professional and leadership development training programs for all career stages.\nOur industry and team are experiencing transformation and we have responded by becoming a learning organization, helping to guide our employees in their journey to reach their full potential. We invest heavily in our training programs, which we believe will better position us to meet our current and future business needs while also driving employee retention. We offer a broad range of leadership and professional training programs for career growth and advancement, which begins with an introduction to our culture when our employees start and progresses through new people leadership trainings as well as high potential development programs at the manager, senior manager, director and managing director levels. We provide all management-level employees with the opportunity to develop their skills through our Leadership, Airport Operations and Digital Training Institutes. With respect to our technical positions, we have developed state-of-the art technical training programs that include immersive training, virtual reality, simulations, on the job training and assessments of proficiency to ensure we operate at the highest level of aviation safety and customer service.\n4.\nThe ability for our employees to qualify for retirement, health and wellness benefits as well as, of course, travel privileges.\nWhile our rewards package for most of our employees is determined by collective bargaining agreements, it includes competitive base pay, travel privileges and other comprehensive benefits, including health, wellness and retirement programs for all our employees, including part-time employees. We review both industry and local market data at least annually to identify trends and market gaps in order to maintain the competitiveness of our compensation and employee benefit programs. With respect to executives, a substantial proportion of their total rewards package is variable, at-risk pay that is based on Company performance and delivered in the form of equity, supporting alignment over the long term between our executives and our stockholders. We align our executives' long-term equity compensation with our stockholders' interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance. In addition, the \n10\nTable of Contents\nCompany has performance-based compensation programs for other management employee leaders, including managers, supervisors and team leads.\n5.\nThe maintenance of our relationships with our labor unions.\nWe bargain in good faith with the unions that represent our employees and frequently engage with union leaders. Collective bargaining agreements between the Company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the Railway Labor Act (\"RLA\"). Such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date, upon which the agreement is considered \"open for amendment.\" The following table reflects the Company's represented employee groups, the number of employees per represented group, union representation for each employee group, and the amendable date for each employee group's collective bargaining agreement as of December 31, 2024:\nEmployee \nGroup\nNumber of Employees\nUnion\nAgreement Open for Amendment\nUnited Airlines, Inc.:\nFlight Attendants \n26,337\nAssociation of Flight Attendants\nAugust 2021\nFleet Service\n16,017\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (the \"IAM\")\nMay 2025\nPilots\n16,123\nAir Line Pilots Association (\"ALPA\")\nOctober 2027\nPassenger Service\n11,650\nIAM\nMay 2025\nTechnicians\n9,967\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters (the \"IBT\")\nDecember 2024\nStorekeepers\n1,300\nIAM\nMay 2025\nDispatchers \n515\nProfessional Airline Flight Control Association\nDecember 2024\nFleet Tech Instructors\n146\nIAM\nMay 2025\nTechnical Operations Maintenance Planners\n136\nIBT\nMay 2028\nTechnical Operations Maintenance Controllers\n88\nIBT\nNovember 2026\nLoad Planners\n78\nIAM\nMay 2025\nMaintenance Instructors\n55\nIAM\nMay 2025\nSecurity Officers\n43\nIAM\nMay 2025\nUnited Ground Express, Inc.:\nPassenger Service \n5,882\nIAM\nMarch 2025\nBoard Oversight\n: Our Board, assisted by several of its committees, plays a key role in the strategic oversight of management regarding the development, implementation and effectiveness of the Company's policies and strategies relating to human capital management. The Board's Executive Committee oversees and reviews significant human capital strategies, including culture and talent management matters, and the Board's Public Responsibility Committee reviews and monitors the development and implementation of the Company's people impact strategic goals and objectives. Many of our Board members have experience overseeing workforce issues as CEOs and presidents of other companies or organizations. The Compensation Committee also engages an independent compensation and benefits consulting firm to help evaluate our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against a group of peer companies, including peers within the airline industry.\nAdditional Information\n:\n See our report at crreport.united.com, for additional information on our human capital management programs, initiatives and measures. We are committed to transparency and sharing our U.S. workforce self-identified demographic data on an annual basis on our website. The information contained on or connected to the Company's website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the SEC.\nIndustry Regulation\nAirlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory oversight. The following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory framework applicable to our business. Regulatory requirements, including but not limited \n11\nTable of Contents\nto those discussed below, affect our operations and increase our operating costs, and future regulatory developments may continue to do the same. In addition, should any of our governmental authorizations or certificates be modified, suspended or revoked, our business and competitive position could be materially adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—\n\"The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, which imposes significant costs and may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition\n\" for additional information on the material effects of compliance with government regulations.\nDomestic Regulation. \nAll carriers engaged in air transportation in the United States are subject to regulation by the DOT. Absent an exemption, no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity. The DOT also grants international route authority, approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition. The DOT regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising, denied boarding compensation, tarmac delays, baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future. The DOT has launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts.\nAirlines are also regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (the \"FAA\"), an agency within the DOT, primarily in the areas of flight safety, air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness. The FAA issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates, prescribes maintenance procedures, oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training. From time to time, the FAA issues directives that require air carriers to inspect, modify or ground aircraft and other equipment, potentially causing the Company to incur substantial, unplanned expenses. The airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the RLA, a federal statute. The Company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the DOT, FAA, DOJ, DHS, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other U.S. regulatory bodies.\nAirport Access.\n Access to landing and take-off rights, or \"slots,\" at several major U.S. airports served by the Company are subject to government regulation. Federally-mandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at three airports: Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., and John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in the New York City metropolitan region. Additional restrictions on takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be implemented in the future and could affect the Company's rights of ownership and transfer as well as its operations.\nLegislation\n.\n The airline industry is subject to legislative actions (or inactions) that may have an impact on operations and costs. In May 2024, the U.S. Congress approved the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, expiring September 30, 2028. Among other things, the FAA reauthorization \nincreased the authorized funding level for the FAA and required the hiring of additional air traffic controllers, an effort to address staffing and resource shortages and improve the operation of the ATC system in the U.S.\nInternational Regulation. \nInternational air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. In connection with the Company's international services, the Company is regulated by both the U.S. government and the governments of the foreign countries or regions the Company serves. In addition, the availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments.\nLegislation.\n \nForeign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws, rules and regulations that meet or exceed U.S. requirements. In cases where this activity exceeds U.S. requirements, additional burden and liability may be placed on the Company. Certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation from the Company and/or enforcement penalties in addition to changes in operating procedures due to overbooked, canceled or delayed flights.\nAirport Access.\n Historically, access to foreign routes has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the U.S. and each foreign jurisdiction involved. These agreements regulate the routes served, the number of carriers allowed to serve each route and the frequency of carriers' flights. Since the early 1990s, the U.S. has pursued a policy of \"Open Skies\" (meaning all U.S. and foreign carriers have access to the destination) under which the U.S. government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between U.S. and foreign points. Currently, there are more than 100 Open Skies agreements in effect. However, even with Open Skies, many of the airports that the Company serves in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Pacific, Europe, and Latin America maintain slot controls. A large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion, environmental and noise protection and reduced capacity due to runway and ATC construction work, among other reasons.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe Company's ability to serve some foreign routes and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the U.S. government and the relevant foreign governments. Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements. Depending on the nature of any such change, the value of the Company's international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished. Similarly, foreign governments control their airspace and can restrict our ability to overfly their territory, which may enhance or diminish the value of the Company's existing international route authorizations and slot rights.\nEpidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may cause governments to restrict entry of passengers and/or to impose health management rules which can include vaccinations, boosters, testing, quarantine upon arrival, health declarations and temperature screens, among others. Such requirements may result in reduced demand for travel in certain circumstances and may cause the Company to suspend certain international services. Although certain governments may grant waivers for limited periods that allow the Company to maintain existing slot rights and route authorizations while not operating at a particular foreign point, waivers are not guaranteed. \nEnvironmental Regulation.\n The airline industry is subject to stringent federal, state, local and international environmental regulations, including those regulating emissions to air, water discharges, safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes. The Company endeavors to comply with all applicable environmental regulations.\nClimate Change and Sustainability.\n As outlined above, the Company's commitment to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company extends beyond seeking to comply with regulatory requirements. At the same time, efforts to reduce carbon emissions through environmental sustainability legislation and regulation, or non-binding standards or accords, is an increased focus of global, national, and regional regulators. The International Civil Aviation Organization's (\"ICAO\") Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), adopted in October 2016, is intended to be a single global market-based measure to achieve carbon-neutral growth for international aviation, by requiring airlines to purchase eligible carbon offsets, or lower their carbon offsetting obligations through the use of eligible sustainable fuels. In October 2022, the ICAO Assembly passed a resolution establishing the baseline for the subsequent phases of CORSIA at 85% of 2019 emissions. This decision is expected to substantially increase United's anticipated CORSIA compliance costs for the first phase, 2024-2026, as compared to the prior 2019-only baseline. The exact mechanism by which CORSIA will be implemented domestically is currently unknown as the federal government has not enacted legislation or regulations to implement the first phase of CORSIA. \nOther jurisdictions are proposing or enacting regulations to limit GHG emissions from aviation. A policy to regulate GHG emissions from aviation known as the European Union (\"EU\") Emission Trading System (\"ETS\") was adopted in 2009, but applicability to flights arriving at or departing from airports outside the EU has been postponed several times, most recently until 2027. The extension of the EU ETS to extra-EU flights could still occur in future years, depending on the EU government's assessment of the effectiveness of CORSIA. Domestically, in December 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO airplane CO\n2\n emission standards. In February 2024, the same standards were finalized by the FAA, mandating improved fuel-efficient technologies for airplanes manufactured after January 1, 2028.\nThe Company believes that policies that incentivize the production of SAF, such as the passage of tax credit incentives for the production of SAF, will enable the Company to decarbonize its operations more cost efficiently than a patchwork of regulatory requirements on aviation, particularly those that require airlines to reduce flights or impose the cost of transitioning to low-carbon alternatives disproportionately on airlines. The Company lauded the adoption of incentives for SAF that were implemented at both the federal level and in several states and will continue to work with policymakers to adopt policies that incentivize the production of SAF to allow the industry to transition to a lower carbon future. In addition, while the Company continues to plan on meeting its mid-term and long-term climate goals without relying on voluntary, traditional carbon offsets, the Company may be subject to future regulatory requirements that require the purchase of non-voluntary, traditional carbon offsets, which may expose the Company to additional costs associated with the procurement of offsets or limited supply in the carbon offsets market. The Company believes that policies that promote in-sector emissions reductions, rather than carbon offset purchases, will better support the industry's transition to a lower carbon future.\nAt the state level, the regulatory approach taken so far has largely been focused on incentivizing the production and use of SAF. Various states, including California, Washington, and Oregon, have developed low carbon fuel standards that incentivize the use of SAF, while Illinois, Minnesota and Washington have adopted SAF-specific tax credits.\nSeveral countries are considering or finalizing climate-related legislation that impacts aviation. A number of SAF mandates have recently been finalized in foreign jurisdictions that we expect will increase the Company's operating costs by causing aviation fuel suppliers to increase their prices. In some limited cases, the mandates will require the Company to comply with reporting obligations. In 2023, the EU finalized its ReFuelEU regulation which requires fuel suppliers in EU states to supply \n13\nTable of Contents\ncertain minimum percentages of SAF in the aviation fuel they provide to aircraft operators at covered EU airports, beginning with 2% in 2025 and eventually rising to 70% by 2050. As of January 1, 2025, United is required to submit verified reports to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency on its purchases of SAF, its actual aviation fuel uplift at the EU covered airports, and tankering practices (if any). Aviation fuel prices in Europe are anticipated to significantly increase as a result of ReFuelEU.\nIn November 2024, the UK government adopted a SAF mandate through its Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024. The UK SAF mandate requires aviation fuel companies to supply at least 2% SAF within the aviation fuel supplied to the UK in 2025, increasing to a minimum of 22% SAF in 2040. Aviation fuel suppliers must apply for tradeable SAF certificates to meet their obligation or pay a buy-out price. Although this legislation does not impose any compliance obligations on airlines, the Company believes the UK SAF mandate will similarly lead to higher aviation fuel prices within the UK (as with the EU SAF mandate). SAF blending mandates have also been introduced or proposed in France, Norway, India, and Japan.\nOther regulations are also emerging globally that would require companies such as United to increasingly measure, disclose, and mitigate environmental sustainability risks both within their operations and their supply chains, such as the EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. \nOther Regulations\n.\n Our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the United States and internationally. These include noise-related restrictions on aircraft types and operating times and state and local air quality initiatives which have resulted in, or could in the future result in, curtailments in services, increased operating costs, limits on expansion, or further emission reduction requirements. Certain airports and/or governments, both domestically and internationally, either have established or are seeking to establish environmental fees and other requirements applicable to carbon emissions, local air quality pollutants and/or noise and the use of products and material such as single-use plastics. The implementation of these requirements is expected to result in increased operational costs to develop compliance programs and strategies. \nGovernmental authorities in the U.S. and abroad have passed legislation restricting the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\") which have been used in manufacturing, industrial, and consumer applications, including those related to aviation. Certain state governments and local municipalities have adopted legislation prohibiting the use of Class B fire-fighting foam agents that contain intentionally added PFAS. As a result, the Company continues to incur costs to convert existing fixed foam fire suppression systems to accommodate PFAS-free firefighting foam agents. In addition, the EPA has developed the PFAS Strategic Roadmap, which includes regulatory actions across a wide spectrum of its statutory authorities, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. In April 2024, the EPA designated two PFAS substances, perfluorooctanoic acid (\"PFOA\") and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (\"PFOS\") as hazardous substances under CERCLA. The rule authorizes the EPA to order cleanup actions and hold responsible parties liable under CERCLA's joint and several liability scheme. Additionally, the rule requires the Company to immediately report releases that meet or exceed the reportable quantity of PFOA or PFOS to the EPA and any other applicable state and local agencies. The Company expects these broad regulatory policies will increase the risk of incurring remediation costs and/or liabilities at current and former locations at which the Company currently or historically used fire-fighting foam agents containing PFOA, PFOS or other PFAS substances. To mitigate these risks, the Company is working to remove PFAS-containing fire-fighting foam from its hangars and other assets through a phased retrofit/replacement strategy and is committed to transitioning to PFAS-free materials for fire suppression. Finally, environmental cleanup laws and lease obligations could require the Company to undertake (or subject the Company to liability for costs associated with) investigation and remediation actions at certain owned or leased locations or third-party disposal locations. Because PFOA, PFOS and other PFAS substances are regulated under CERCLA and other environmental cleanup laws, the Company may become subject to potential liability for its historic usage of materials containing PFAS, in addition to potential liabilities for other hazardous substances generated by the Company's operations. Future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time.\nWhile the Company is required to comply with numerous applicable environmental regulations, the Company believes that these regulations and programs, including the first phase of CORSIA, EPA regulations regarding PFAS and GHG emissions, and other environmental regulations, are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's results or competitive position. However, the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the Company are difficult to predict, and the financial impact to the Company and the aviation industry could be significant.\n14\nTable of Contents\nInformation about Our Executive Officers\nBelow is a list of the Company's executive officers as of the date hereof, including their name, office(s) held and age.\nName\nPosition\nAge\nTorbjorn (Toby) J.

Business of this Form 10-K to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThis section generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 (the \"2023 Annual Report\").\nExecutive Summary\nOverview\nUnited Airlines Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, \"UAL\" or the \"Company\") is a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, \"United\"). \nAs UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United's operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL's revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL's assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" and the \"Company\" in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.\nOur current expectations described below are forward-looking statements and our actual results and timing may vary materially based on various factors that include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under \"Strategy,\" \"Economic and Market Factors,\" \"Governmental Actions,\" \n\"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K\n. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\nStrategy\nOur shared purpose is \"Connecting People. Uniting the World.\" We have the most comprehensive route network among North American carriers, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.\nWe are the largest airline measured by available seat miles in the world, helping to connect around 174 million passengers to more than 360 destinations across six continents. The Company remains focused on delivering on four strategic pillars, which it believes has helped, and will continue, to differentiate United from the rest of the industry:\n•\nUnited Next:\n In 2024 we continued to make progress with our United Next plan to align our network and product with the potential of our hubs while remaining focused on protecting the safety of our employees and customers and providing a superior customer experience. United Next aims to increase customer choice and win brand-loyal customers by offering a diversity of products ranging from Basic Economy to Polaris and growing our leading global network, which the Company expects will lead to diverse revenue streams for the Company. As part of our United Next growth plan, we expect to take delivery of over 660 new narrow- and widebody aircraft by the end of 2033. The new aircraft that the Company has taken delivery of to date have increased our gauge, scale, and connectivity, as well as improved the Company's fuel efficiency. Other key highlights of our United Next plan include:\n–\nincreasing our employee headcount by more than 30,000 employees since 2020;\n–\nsurpassing 300 new and retrofit aircraft featuring our signature interior with bigger bins, seatback screens at every seat and Bluetooth connectivity;\n37\nTable of Contents\n–\nexpanding our leading global network to destinations like Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Nuuk, Greenland; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Palermo, Italy; Bilbao, Spain; Faro, Portugal; Madeira Island, Portugal; Puerto Escondido, Mexico; and Dakar, Senegal;\n–\nlaunching Kinective Media\nSM\n (the first media network that uses insights from travel behaviors to connect customers to personalized advertising, experiences and offers from leading brands);\n–\nannouncing an industry-leading agreement with SpaceX to bring Starlink's Wi-Fi service (the world's fastest, most reliable Wi-Fi in the sky) to the Company's aircraft; and\n–\nmaking significant technology changes that empower our employees and improve the customer experience.\n•\nOperational excellence:\n The most important factor for customer satisfaction is on-time flights. We face some unique challenges in this respect because we operate hubs in the most congested and constrained airports in the country. That backdrop means that United needs to be a leader at using technology to overcome these challenges. We have been working strategically to overcome operational challenges and continue to innovate in order to make advancements in this area.\n•\nPre-tax margin:\n We believe that best-in-class margin performance will provide the cash flow needed to support our planned investments in growth.\n•\nCustomer service:\n We believe that excellent customer service is part of de-commoditizing air travel. Our people are our greatest asset and they are by far the most important part of our product. Ultimately our people provide customers with the service they expect.\nEconomic and Market Factors\nThe airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, airline capacity, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. We, like other companies in our industry, have been subject to these and other industry-specific competitive dynamics. In addition, our operations, supply chain, partners and suppliers have been subject to various global macroeconomic factors. We expect to continue to remain vulnerable to a number of industry-specific and global macroeconomic factors that may cause our actual results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations or current expectations. The economic and market factors and trends that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: the execution and effect of our business strategies, including our United Next plan, especially relating to our focus on expanding market and product opportunities and the growth in the scale of our operations; the impact on the Company of significant operational challenges by third parties on which we rely; aircraft delivery delays; rising inflationary pressures; labor market and supply chain constraints and related costs affecting us and our partners; volatile fuel prices; increasing maintenance expenses; changes in interest rates; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates, including an economic downturn leading to a decrease in demand for air travel or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may impact international travel demand. We continue to monitor the potential favorable or unfavorable impacts of these and other factors on our business, operations, financial condition, future results of operations, liquidity and financial flexibility, which are dependent on future developments, including as a result of those factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility and our growth plans may be delayed, particularly in the short term, due to the impact of the above factors and trends.\nGovernmental Actions\nWe operate in complex, highly regulated environments in the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom and other regions around the world. Compliance with laws, regulations, administrative practices and other restrictions or legal requirements in the countries in which we do business is onerous and expensive. In addition, changes to existing legal requirements or the implementation of new legal requirements and any failure to comply with such legal requirements could negatively impact our business, operations, financial condition, future results of operations, liquidity and financial flexibility by increasing the Company's costs, limiting the Company's ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company's products and services and requiring changes to the Company's supply chain and its business. Legal requirements that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: the closure of our flying airspace and termination of other operations due to regional conflicts, including the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and interruptions of our flying as a result of the military conflict in the Middle East, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of these conflicts beyond their current scope; delays in aircraft certification (especially relating to the 737 MAX 10 aircraft); increased FAA oversight of the aircraft production process; any legal requirement that would result in a reshaping of the \n38\nTable of Contents\nbenefits that we provide to our consumers through our loyalty program or the co-branded credit cards issued by our partner; the effect of any potential changes in trade tariffs that we are unable to mitigate; and certain rules and regulations proposed by the DOT that would impose additional costs and operational restrictions on airlines. Changes in existing applicable legal requirements or new applicable legal requirements as well as the related interpretations and enforcement practices regarding them, create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be understood and applied. As a result, the impact of changing and new legal requirements generally cannot be reasonably predicted and those requirements may ultimately require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures.\nResults of Operations\nSelect financial data and operating statistics are provided in the tables

increase in passengers.\nCargo revenue increased $248 million, or 16.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher tonnage, partially offset by lower yields.\nOther operating revenue increased $315 million, or 9.9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in mileage revenue from non-airline partners, including credit card spending with our co-branded credit card partner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as well as increases in the purchases of United Club memberships, visitor volume and purchases of one-time United Club passes primarily due to a 5.3% increase in

increased $1.9 billion, or 12.8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to annual wage rate increases across certain employee groups and a nearly 4% increase in headcount largely due to increased flight activity.\nAircraft fuel expense decreased $895 million, or 7.1%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to a lower average price per gallon of fuel, partially offset by increased consumption from higher flight activity.\nLanding fees and other rent increased $361 million, or 11.7%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to rate increases at various airports, terminal expansions and other increases in the number of airport gates as well as higher landed weight volume due to increased flight activity.\nAircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $327 million, or 12.0%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to increased volumes of engine overhauls, airframe maintenance, materials use and component repair costs mainly as a result of increased flight activity and fleet growth.\n40\nTable of Contents\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $257 million, or 9.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to the induction of new aircraft and related spare parts, as well as certain aircraft improvements.\nRegional capacity purchase costs increased $116 million, or 4.8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to an 8% increase in regional capacity as well as increases in contractual rates.\nDistribution expenses increased $254 million, or 12.8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher credit card fees, travel agency commissions and global distribution fees driven by the overall increase in passenger revenue. Also, starting in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reclassified certain commissions from contra-revenue to distribution expense as an immaterial reclassification correction, which increased distribution expense by $187 million compared to the prior year.\nThe table below presents special charges recorded by the Company during the years ended December 31 (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and other special charges\n$\n112 \n$\n135 \nLabor contract ratification bonuses\n— \n814 \nTotal special charges\n$\n112 \n$\n949 \nSee Note 13 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOther operating expenses increased $1.0 billion, or 12.3%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to increased flight activity and onboard passengers, as well as the impacts of inflationary pressures. Other operating expenses include expenditures related to information technology projects and services, food and beverage offerings, passenger services, personnel-related costs and ground handling.\nNonoperating Income (Expense). \nThe following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the Company's nonoperating income (expense) for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):\n2024\n2023\nIncrease (Decrease)\n% Change\nInterest expense\n$\n(1,629)\n$\n(1,956)\n$\n(327)\n(16.7)\nInterest income\n726 \n827 \n(101)\n(12.2)\nInterest capitalized\n227 \n182 \n45 \n24.7 \nUnrealized gains (losses) on investments, net\n(199)\n27 \n(226)\nNM\nMiscellaneous, net \n(53)\n96 \n(149)\nNM\nTotal nonoperating expense, net\n$\n(928)\n$\n(824)\n$\n104 \n12.6 \nInterest expense decreased $327 million, or 16.7%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of various debt prepayments and scheduled amortization combined with lower interest rates on refinanced debt.\nInterest income decreased $101 million, or 12.2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower balances in our short-term investment portfolio, which were partially offset by higher interest rates. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nInterest capitalized increased $45 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in accumulated spend on capital projects.\nUnrealized losses on investments, net was $199 million in 2024 as compared to $27 million in unrealized gains, net in 2023, primarily due to the change in the market value of the Company's investments in equity securities. See Notes 9 and 13 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nMiscellaneous, net changed by $149 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to debt extinguishment and modification fees related to debt prepayments and refinancing, higher foreign exchange losses and a decrease in the benefit from the Company's net periodic benefit cost of its pension and postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 10 and 13 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on the debt prepayments and refinancing.\nIncome Taxes.\n See Note 7 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information related to income taxes.\n41\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nWe deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, including returns to stockholders through potential share repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $14.5 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as compared to approximately $14.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity needs for the next 12 months, and we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with our anticipated access to the capital markets and projected cash from operations. We regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements (including in connection with our capital commitments for our firm order aircraft and any changes to such commitments), planned UAL common stock or Warrant purchases under our share repurchase program and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize stockholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. We also regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital structure to efficiently manage financial risks, liquidity access and cost of capital.\nOn February 15, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"), increasing its borrowing capacity by $1.115 billion, bringing the total amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility to $2.865 billion. On April 16, 2024, the Company further increased its revolving loan commitments by $100 million for a total amount of $2.965 billion as of December 31, 2024. Of this total, $2.95 billion expires February 15, 2029 and $15 million expires April 21, 2025, after the extension of the maturity of $150 million from April 21, 2025 to February 15, 2029. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by certain route authorities and airport slots and gates. No borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2024. See Note 10 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on these financing transactions.\nWe have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, leases of aircraft, airport and other facilities, and pension funding obligations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $33.6 billion of debt, finance lease, operating lease and other financial liabilities, including $3.9 billion that will become due in the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of certain new aircraft and related spare engines. Our debt agreements contain customary terms and conditions as well as various affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens on collateral, make certain dividends, stock repurchases, restricted investments and other restricted payments, and consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Our debt agreements also contain events of default customary for similar financings including, in certain cases, cross-payment default and cross-acceleration to other material indebtedness. Certain of our debt agreements contain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted liquidity at all times, which includes unrestricted cash, certain liquid and short-term investments and any undrawn amounts under any revolving credit facility, and to maintain a minimum ratio of appraised value of collateral to the outstanding debt secured by such collateral on a senior basis of 1.6 to 1.0, tested semi-annually. As of December 31, 2024, UAL and United were in compliance with their respective debt covenants under these agreements. As of December 31, 2024, a substantial portion of the Company's assets, principally aircraft and certain related assets, its loyalty program, certain route authorities and airport slots and gates, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. See Note 10 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on aircraft financing and other debt instruments.\nFor 2025, the Company expects less than $7.0 billion of adjusted capital expenditures, in light of certain aircraft delivery delays. Adjusted capital expenditures is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). It is calculated as capital expenditures, net of flight equipment purchase deposit returns, plus property and equipment acquired through the issuance of debt, finance leases and other financial liabilities. We are not providing a target for or a reconciliation to capital expenditures, net of flight equipment purchase deposit returns, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because we are not able to predict non-cash capital expenditures without unreasonable efforts, and therefore we also are not able to determine the probable significance of such items. We believe that adjusting capital expenditures for assets acquired through the issuance of debt, finance leases and other financial liabilities is useful to investors in order to appropriately reflect the total amounts spent on capital expenditures. The Company's estimate for aircraft expenditures reflects its current assumptions regarding delayed aircraft deliveries. See Note 12 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments, including aircraft expenditures reflecting contractual delivery dates without adjustment for expected delays. The Company has backstop financing commitments available from certain of its aircraft manufacturers for a limited number of its future aircraft deliveries, subject to certain customary conditions.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow for the years ended December 31 (in millions): \n42\nTable of Contents\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n9,445 \n$\n6,911 \n$\n6,066 \nInvesting activities\n(2,651)\n(6,106)\n(13,829)\nFinancing activities\n(4,182)\n(1,892)\n(3,349)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n2,612 \n$\n(1,087)\n$\n(11,112)\nSee the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOperating Activities. \nCash flows provided by operating activities for 2024 were $2.5 billion higher than 2023 primarily due to an approximately $0.9 billion increase in operating income and an approximately $0.9 billion increase in advance ticket sales due to capacity growth as demand trends for air travel continued to accelerate.\nInvesting Activities.\n Cash flows used in investing activities decreased $3.5 billion in 2024 as compared to the year-ago period mainly related to approximately $1.8 billion lower net activity in purchases and sales of short-term and other investments, as well as a $1.6 billion decrease in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures primarily consisted of the purchase of aircraft, aircraft improvements and advance deposits for future aircraft purchases.\nFinancing Activities. \nSignificant financing events in 2024 were as follows:\nDebt, Finance Lease and Other Financial Liability Principal Payments\n. During 2024, the Company made payments for debt, finance leases, and other financial liabilities of $10.1 billion, including the $3.9 billion prepayment of its 2021 term loan, $1.8 billion prepayment of the outstanding principal balance of its MileagePlus term loan, and a $0.4 billion prepayment of its 2024 term loan.\nDebt Issuances.\n In 2024, the Company raised:\n•\n$2.5 billion under the new term loan facility;\n•\n$1.4 billion through the issuance of equipment notes (the \"2024 Equipment Notes\") \nsecured by 48 Boeing aircraft delivered new from the manufacturer from October 2010 to December 2023\n; and\n•\n$2.2 billion through the issuance of debt, not including the 2024 Equipment Notes, and other financial liabilities on aircraft.\nSee Note 10 and Note 11 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on aircraft financing.\nShare Repurchases.\n As part of our capital deployment program, the Company announced on October 15, 2024 that its Board authorized a new share repurchase program, allowing for purchases of up to $1.5 billion in the aggregate of outstanding UAL common stock and Warrants, subject to a limit of $500 million in the aggregate through 2024. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 997,076 shares of UAL common stock at an average price of $81.26 for a total investment of approximately $81 million as part of the share repurchase program. As of February 24, 2025, the dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is approximately $1.3 billion. See Note 3 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on the share repurchase program.\nSignificant financing events in 2023 were as follows:\nDebt, Finance Lease and Other Financial Liability Principal Payments\n. During 2023, the Company made $4.2 billion of principal payments on debt, finance leases, and other financial liabilities. The payments in 2023 included a prepayment of $1.0 billion of the outstanding principal amount under a 2021 term loan facility.\nDebt Issuances.\n In 2023, the Company issued equipment notes (the \"2023 Equipment Notes\") in the aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion to finance 39 Boeing aircraft delivered new to the Company from August 2022 to May 2023.\nAlso, during 2023, United borrowed $1.1 billion for aircraft financings.\nFor additional information regarding these Liquidity and Capital Resource matters, see Notes 10, 11 and 12\n \nto the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. For information regarding non-cash investing and financing activities, see the Company's statements of consolidated cash flows. For a discussion of the Company's sources and uses of cash in 2023 as \n43\nTable of Contents\ncompared to 2022, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Annual Report.\nCredit Ratings.\n As of the filing date of this report, UAL and United had the following corporate credit ratings:\nS&P\nMoody's\nFitch\nUAL\nBB\nBa2\nBB-\nUnited\nBB\n*\nBB-\n*The credit agency does not issue corporate credit ratings for subsidiary entities. \nThe Company has been able to secure financing with investment grade credit ratings for certain enhanced equipment trust certificates (\"EETCs\"), term loans and secured bond financings. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of future financing for the Company as well as affect the fair market value of existing debt. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Currently Moody's and Fitch have assigned the Company a positive outlook, while S&P maintains a stable outlook.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nBelow is a summary of additional liquidity matters. See the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments.\nPension and other postretirement plans\nNote 8\nLong-term debt and debt covenants\nNote 10\nLeases\nNote 11\nCommitments, contingencies and capacity purchase agreements\nNote 12\nThe Company's business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft with cash, by using EETC financing, by entering into finance or operating leases, or through other financings. The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.\nThe table below provides a summary of the Company's current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 (in billions):\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nAfter 2029\nLong-term debt and related interest (a)\n$\n4.1 \n$\n5.8 \n$\n3.2 \n$\n2.5 \n$\n3.5 \n$\n11.4 \nFinance leases\n0.2 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nOperating leases (b)\n0.8 \n0.7 \n0.9 \n0.7 \n0.5 \n3.1 \nLeases not yet commenced (c)\n0.1 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n0.4 \n0.4 \n4.2 \nOther financial liabilities\n0.5 \n0.3 \n0.6 \n0.3 \n0.3 \n3.2 \nRegional CPAs (d)\n2.7 \n2.8 \n2.1 \n1.8 \n1.4 \n4.1 \nPostretirement benefit payments and pension funding (e)\n0.2 \n0.5 \n0.3 \n0.1 \n0.1 \n0.4 \nCapital and other purchases (f)\n9.6 \n6.0 \n4.7 \n6.5 \n8.1 \n19.5 \nTotal\n$\n18.2 \n$\n16.3 \n$\n12.2 \n$\n12.3 \n$\n14.3 \n$\n45.9 \n(a)\nLong-term debt presented in the Company's financial statements is net of $184 million of debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs which are being amortized over the debt terms.

Amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plans and bond rates. Postretirement benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded. See Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on these benefit plans.\n(f)\nRepresents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft, spare engines and other purchase commitments. See Note 12 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.\nThe Company has significant financial obligations and guarantees that could impact its future cash flow. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has $490 million in letters of credit and surety bonds with expiration dates through 2035, some of which are cash collateralized. Additionally, United is involved in fuel consortia at major airports, which help reduce fuel distribution and storage costs. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through various debt obligations. The Company has indirect guarantees for approximately $2.7 billion in loans secured by fuel facility leases in which United participates, with a contingent exposure of about $504 million. These indirect guarantees are set to expire between 2027 and 2056. The Company's contingent exposure could increase in the future if the participation of other air carriers in such fuel consortia decreases. See Note 12 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information related to these guarantees and increased cost provisions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 1 and Note 2 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional discussion of these estimates and our other significant accounting policies. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.\nPassenger Revenue Recognition\n. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Passenger tickets and related ancillary services sold by the Company for flights are purchased primarily via credit card transactions, with payments collected by the Company in advance of the performance of related services. The Company initially records ticket sales in its Advance ticket sales liability, deferring revenue recognition until the travel occurs. All tickets sold at any given point in time have travel dates through the next 12 months. The Company estimates the value of Advance ticket sales that will expire unused (\"ticket breakage\") and recognizes revenue and any changes in estimates in proportion to the usage of the related tickets. To determine ticket breakage, the Company uses its historical experience with expired tickets and certificates and other facts, such as recent aging trends, program changes and modifications that could affect the ultimate expiration patterns.\nFrequent Flyer Accounting. \nUnited's MileagePlus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards, benefits and services to program participants. Members in this program earn miles for travel on United, United Express, Star Alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Members can also earn miles by purchasing goods and services from our network of non-airline partners. We have contracts to sell miles to these partners with the terms extending from approximately one to five years. These partners include domestic and international credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. Miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government-imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air travel and non-travel awards.\nCo-Brand Agreement\n. United has a contract (the \"Co-Brand Agreement\") to sell MileagePlus miles to its co-branded credit card partner Chase. Chase awards miles to MileagePlus members based on their credit card activity. United identified the following significant separately identifiable performance obligations in the Co-Brand Agreement:\n•\nMileagePlus miles awarded – United has a performance obligation to provide MileagePlus cardholders with miles to be used for air travel and non-travel award redemptions. The Company records Passenger revenue related to the travel awards when the transportation is provided and records Other operating revenue related to the non-travel awards when the goods or services are delivered. The Company records the cost associated with non-travel awards in Other operating revenue, as an agent.\n•\nMarketing – United has a performance obligation to provide Chase access to United's customer list and the use of United's brand. Marketing revenue is recorded to Other operating revenue as miles are delivered to Chase.\n45\nTable of Contents\n•\nAdvertising – United has a performance obligation to provide advertising in support of the MileagePlus card in various customer contact points such as United's website, email promotions, direct mail campaigns, airport advertising and in-flight advertising. Advertising revenue is recorded to Other operating revenue as miles are delivered to Chase.\n•\nOther travel-related benefits – United's performance obligations are comprised of various items such as waived bag fees, seat upgrades and lounge passes. Lounge passes are recorded to Other operating revenue as customers use the lounge passes. Bag fees and seat upgrades are recorded to Passenger revenue at the time of the associated travel.\nWe account for all the payments received under the Co-Brand Agreement by allocating them to the separately identifiable performance obligations. The fair value of the separately identifiable performance obligations is determined using management's estimated selling price of each component. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. The Company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the Co-Brand Agreement, at the inception of the contract, in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the components to be delivered.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets. \nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. For the Company's China route authority, the Company performed a quantitative assessment which involved determining the fair value of the asset and comparing that amount to the asset's carrying value. To determine the fair value of the China route authority, the Company used a discounted cash flow method. Key assumptions used in the valuation model included forecasted revenues, margin and an overall discount rate. These assumptions are inherently uncertain as they relate to future events and circumstances.\nSee Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains certain \"forward-looking statements,\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including in Part II, Item 7.

All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information available to us on the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulation.\nOur actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without limitation, the following: execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan; changes in our fleet and network strategy or other factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders, costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or entry into aircraft orders on less favorable terms, as well as any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as planned, including as a result of any mandatory groundings of aircraft; any failure to effectively manage, and receive anticipated benefits and returns from, acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other portfolio actions, or related exposures to unknown liabilities or other issues or underperformance as compared to our expectations; adverse \n46\nTable of Contents\npublicity, increased regulatory scrutiny, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and operational restrictions as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft, engines and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional network and United Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States and globally; reliance on third-party service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services; extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate and space, facility and infrastructure constraints at our hubs or other airports; geopolitical conflict, terrorist attacks or security events (including the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and interruptions of our flying as a result of the military conflict in the Middle East, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of these conflicts beyond their current scope); any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our business and the impact of any significant failure or disruption of, or failure to effectively integrate and implement, these technologies or systems; increasing privacy, data security and cybersecurity obligations or a significant data breach; increased use of social media platforms by us, our employees and others; the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our operations or financial performance; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or agreement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel; the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing our debt, including our MileagePlus® senior secured notes; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the price of our common stock; the impacts of seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry; increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage; risks relating to our repurchase program for UAL common stock and Warrants; and other risks and uncertainties set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and under \"Economic and Market Factors\" and \"Governmental Actions\" in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report, as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC.\nThe foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections, beliefs and assumptions upon which we base our expectations may change. For instance, we regularly monitor future demand and booking trends and adjust capacity, as needed. As such, our actual flown capacity may differ materially from currently published flight schedules or current estimations.\n47\nTable of Contents",
