Our s\nustainability framework\n is guided by our commitment to help the energy sector address the \nenergy trilemma of reliability, affordability, and sustainability.\nTo operationalize this commitment, we have built the sustainability governance framework of “the Control Room.” The Control Room is led \nby our Chief Sustainability Officer, who supervises a cross-functional, global team, and chairs our Sustainability Council. Further, we have a \nSafety and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors, which guides and oversees our sustainability goals, impacts, risks, and \nefforts. Our operational efforts are aligned with our business strategy, the priorities of our stakeholders, our commitments, and our aim to \ndeliver innovative technologies to create a more sustainable electric power system.\nThe four pillars of our sustainability framework: Electrify, Decarbonize, Conserve, and Thrive:\n•\nElectrify: Catalyze access to more secure, sustainable, reliable, and affordable electricity, while helping to drive global \neconomic development. \nWe seek to add power generation and grid capacity to strengthen current electricity infrastructure and \nprovide critical redundancy, support electrification in underserved regions, and encourage economic development.\n•\nDecarbonize: Invent, deploy, and service technology to help decarbonize and electrify the world. \nWe seek to advance both \nthe near-term impact by improving the trajectory on carbon intensity and the long-term impact by deploying products that are \nincreasingly capable of lower carbon emissions once supporting infrastructure is deployed at scale.\n \n•\nConserve: Innovate more while using less.\n We are working to reduce both our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions \nand have set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030. We also support the transition \nto a more circular economy and recognize the importance of critical raw materials and nature in our mission. We are working to \ntrack 90% of our top products as part of our circularity framework by 2030, including principles such as eco-design. \n•\nThrive: Advance safe, responsible, \nand inclusive\n working conditions in our operations and across our value chain.\n We \nare committed to prioritizing safety, building and fostering an inclusive workplace globally and in the communities in which we \noperate, promoting a culture of compliance and ethics, and advancing human rights across our supply chain. \n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n2024 FORM 10-K \n5\nThe global shift towards a variety of energy sources, evolving and increased environmental regulations and requirements, and climate \nchange effects, present both challenges and opportunities that may impact our business. See Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for further information \nabout these risks.\nCOMPETITION. \nWe believe GE Vernova's businesses' ability to supply the electric power industry with a broad array of advanced \ntechnologies for an intelligent, sustainable power system that help customers accelerate the energy transition is a key differentiator among \nvarious of our competitors. Due to increasing demand exceeding available capacity for products and services that supply the electrical \npower industry, we face growing competition from emerging threats. The continuing ability to reduce cycle times and ensure available \ncapacity is expected to\n allow us\n to remain competitive as demand for our products and services grows significantly. In addition, continued \ninvestment in our products and services and emerging technologies is necessary for us to successfully compete and deliver economic \nvalue and performance to our customers through efficiency, reliability, and affordability. \nOur businesses operate in highly competitive markets. We compete based on product performance, quality, branding, service and/or price \nacross the industries and geographies served. Various companies compete with us across single or multiple products and services. \nKey Power segment competitors include Siemens Energy, Mitsubishi Power, Westinghouse, Framatome, and Rolls-Royce.\nKey Wind segment competitors include Vestas, Siemens-Gamesa, and Nordex.\nKey Electrification segment competitors include Hitachi Energy, Siemens Energy, Siemens, Schneider Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and \nABB.\nSEGMENTS\n. \nWe report three business segments that are aligned with the nature of equipment and services they provide, specifically \nPower, Wind, and Electrification.\nPower.\n \nOur Power segment serves power generation, industrial, government, and other customers worldwide with products and services \nrelated to energy production. Our products and technologies harness resources such as \nnatural gas, oil, diesel, water, and nuclea\nr to \nproduce electric power and include gas and steam turbines, \nfull balance of plant,\n \nupgrade, and service\n solutions.\nGas Power - \noffers a wide spectrum of heavy-duty and aeroderivative gas turbines for utilities, independent power producers, and \nnumerous industrial applications, ranging from small, mobile power to utility scale power plants. Gas Power also delivers maintenance and \nservice solutions across total plant assets and over their operational lifecycle.\nNu\nclear Power\n -\n provides nuclear technology solutions for boiling water reactors including reactor design, reactor fuel and support services, \nand the design and development of small modular reactors through joint ventures with \nHitachi, Ltd.\nHydro Power - \nprovides a portfolio of solutions and services for hydropower generation for both large hydropower plants and small \nhydropower solutions.\nSteam Power - \noffers a comprehensive range of steam turbine technologies and services primarily for nuclear power plants in North \nAmerica and coal-fired power plants, helping our customers deliver reliable energy, and supporting coal-fired plant customers \ntransitioning \nto a lower-carbon future\n.\nWe believe that gas power plays an essential role in the energy transition, serving as a fundamental source of reliable and dispatchable \npower. Despite evolving market factors related to the energy transition, such as increased renewable energy penetration and new climate \nchange-related legislation and policies, we anticipate the gas power \nindustry\n will grow over the next decade. We expect gas power \ngeneration to increase at low-single digit rates, playing a critical role supporting load growth, maintaining grid stability, and energy security.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, GE Vernova's gas turbine installed base utilization was flat compared to\n the same period last \nyear\n. Growth in Asia from fewer outages and more HA units commissioned and higher utilization in the United States (\nU.S.)\n were offset by \nEurope where increased nuclear, hydro, and renewable energy drove lower gas operations in the year. Global electricity demand increased \nby low-single digits.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our fundamentals remained strong with approximately $73.4 billion in r\nemaining performance obligations\n (RPO) \nand a gas turbine installed base of approximately 7,000 units with approximately 1,700 units under long-term service agreements \nand\n an \naverage remaining contract life of approximately 10 years. As of December 31, 2024, we had 32 HA-Turbines in RPO, 30 being installed \nand commissioned, and 115 HA-Turbines in our installed base with approximately 2.9 million operating hours.\nWe maintain a strong focus on our underwriting discipline and risk management to secure deals that meet our financial hurdles and ensure \nwe deliver confidently for our customers. Operating in emerging markets presents uncertainties in deal closures due to financing and other \ncomplexities. Given the long-cycle nature of our business and the ongoing challenges from inflationary pressures, our Power segment has \nproactively implemented lean initiatives to \nsustain\n cost productivity, collaborated closely with suppliers, and adjusted product and service \npricing in line with market demand, inflation, and industry dynamics.\nWe continue to invest in new product development. In Nuclear Power, we have an agreement \nwith a customer\n for the deployment of small \nmodular nuclear reactor (SMR) technology, making it the first commercial contract of its kind in North America. SMRs have the potential to \nreduce nuclear power plant costs and cycle times through their standardized and modularized design. In Gas Power, we are committed to \nlong-term investments to meet our \ngrowing demand from our customers\n by enhancing production capacity at existing factories to address \nthe increasing need for both equipment and services. We continue to invest in technologies and decarbonization pathways to deliver lower \ncarbon-emitting and more reliable power. In the fourth quarter, we secured an agreement in the United Kingdom for one of the world's first \ncommercial-scale gas-fired power stations with carbon capture, aiming to capture up to 2 million tons of CO\n2\n annually and contributing to \nthe United Kingdom's net-zero goals. We are committed to advancing decarbonization technologies that we believe will provide our \ncustomers with options for more r\nenewable\n \nand more dependable energy. \n2024 FORM 10-K \n6\nWind.\n \nOur Wind segment includes our wind generation technologies, inclusive of onshore and offshore wind turbines and blades. In our \nWind segment, \nwe engineer, manufacture, and commercialize wind turbines,\n an important technology playing a role in the energy transition \nas we seek to decarbonize the \nworld's energy sector\n. \nOnshore Wind - \ndelivers wind turbines, technology, and services for the onshore wind power industry by focusing on work-horse products in \nselect geographies, while continuing to innovate the technology to create wind turbines suitable for various markets and environmental \nconditions. Our workhorse products include our \n2.8-127m, 3.6-154m, and 6.1-158m onshore units. \nWind services assist customers in \nimproving cost, capacity, and performance of their assets over the lifetime of their fleets, utilizing digital infrastructure to monitor, \npredict, \nand\n optimize wind farm energy performance.\n \nOffshore Wind\n - provides offshore wind power technologies and wind farm development for the offshore wind power sector\n.\n Our workhorse \nproduct in the offshore market is our Haliade-X 220m offshore \nunit\n.\nLM Wind Power\n - designs, produces, and tests wind \nturbine blades.\nAs we focus on providing carbon-free electricity reliably and at scale, we have simplified our segment management structure and portfolio \nof product offerings, focusing on fewer and more reliable workhorse products. Our w\norkhorse products account for approximately \n70%\n of \nour equipment RPO at \nDecember 31, 2024\n. Included in our RPO are services agreements on approximately \n23,000\n of our onshore wind \nturbines, from an installed base of approximately \n57,000\n units.\nAt Onshore Wind, we are focused on improving our overall fleet availability. We are reducing product variants and deploying repairs and \nother corrective measures across the fleet. Concurrently, we intend to operate in fewer geographies and focus on those geographic regions \nthat a\nlign better with our products and supply chain footprin\nt, positioning our workhorse products to targeted countries. Our volume mix has \nshifted towards the U.S., currently representing approximately 75% of Onshore Wind's equipment RPO, while our international volume has \nbecome smaller and more profitable. Specifically in the U.S., the\n IRA \nintroduced new, and extended existing, tax incentives, significantly \nimproving project economics for our customers and tu\nrbine producers. Our projects in the U.S. generally benefit from incentives available to \nour customers and broadly available IRA incentives\n. \nWe will continue to monitor government actions for any changes that could adversely \nimpact the market for wind turbine manufacturers. \nFinally\n, we are continuing our restructuring \nprogram\n to reduce our operating costs and \nare seeing the benefits both operationally and financially\n.\nAt Offshore Wind\n, we continue to experience pressure related to our product and project costs and execution timelines, as we deliver on \nour existing backlog. We are committed to driving quality improvements, installation efficiencies, and cost productivity. Similar to Onshore \nWind, \nwe have embarked on a restructuring program to reduce our operating costs\n.\nElectrification.\n \nOur Electrification segment includes grid solutions, power conversion, solar and storage solutions, which we collectively \nrefer to as Electrification Systems, and Electrification Software, that provide products and services required for the transmission, \ndistribution, conversion, storage, and orchestration of electricity from point of generation to point of consumption. Several of the key \nofferings in this segment, for example, include our high-voltage direct current transmission (HVDC) products, power transformers, \nswitchgear, and our grid automation related products and services. \nGrid Solutions \n- enables power utilities and industries worldwide to effectively manage electricity from the point of generation to \nconsumption, helping the reliability, \nefficiency, and\n resiliency of the grid. Offerings include a comprehensive portfolio of equipment, \nhardware, protection and control, automation, and digital services. Grid Solutions also addresses the challenges of the energy transition by \nsafely and reliably connecting intermittent renewable energy generation to transmission networks.\nPower Conversion \n- applies the science and systems of power conversion to provide motors, generators, automation, and control \nequipment, and drives for energy intensive industries such as marine, oil and gas, mining, rail, metals, and test systems.\nSolar & Storage Solutions\n - provides integration of renewable energies that drive stability to the grid and integrates storage and renewable \nenergy generation sources. \nElectrification Software\n - supports the transmission, distribution, conversion, storage, and orchestration of electricity from point of \ngeneration to point of consumption.\nWe continue to experience\n robust demand \nfor our systems, equipment, and services. Demand remains strong for large scale transmission-\nrelated equipment to interconnect renewables and move bulk power. We also continue to benefit from higher growth in orders from other \ntransmission activities within our Grid Solutions business.\nOur Grid Solutions business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs globally. \nWe participate in the onshore \ninterconnection sector and the rapidly growing \noffshore interconnection sector\n with new products and technology. We have developed and \nseek to continue developing new technologies with the intention of solving for a denser, more resilient, stable, and efficient electric grid with \nlower future greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe \nadjust\n pricing and contractual terms of our products and services based on demand, inflation, and industry dynamics. Customer lead-\ntimes have increased as a result of demand outstripping supply, though we are proactively managing this by deploying lean initiatives to \nreduce lead-times and drive cost productivity. In addition, we are making investments to expand our capacity and capabilities to support this \ncontinued growth while benefiting from synergies across our Electrification businesses.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. \nGE Vernova’s R&D efforts focus on driving the energy transition. We are engineering the \ntechnologies, forging the partnerships, and delivering innovations to electrify and decarbonize the world. We expect to invest approximately \n$5 billion of cumulative R&D from 2025 through 2028 across our businesses. Approximately half of this R&D is focused on continuously \n2024 FORM 10-K \n7\nindustrializing existing products and supporting our installed base for this decade. The other half is focused on long-term innovation to \ndeliver our next generation of differentiated products. \nR&D is performed within each of our businesses, and at multiple locations around the world, including at our research facilities in \nNiskayuna, New York and Bangalore, India, which we refer to collectively as Advanced Research. Advanced Research partners with our \nbusinesses on programs to create the technology breakthroughs that will feed our future product roadmaps. They are guided by our \ncustomers’ demands for sustainable, affordable, resilient, and secure energy. Additionally, Advanced Research partners with other \nestablished and start-up companies and educational institutions to incubate and commercialize new technology and launch new \nbusinesses in markets that are key to the energy transition but go beyond GE Vernova’s core businesses. \nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. \nWe have a substantial portfolio of intellectual property (\nIP)\n assets, registered and unregistered, that \nprotect both our investments in R&D across our businesses as well as our products and services. To protect our innovation, we rely on a \nvariety of IP rights and data protection measures, as well as monitor the activities of third parties to ensure \nthat unauthorized use of IP does \nnot go unremedied\n.\nPatents are an important part of our IP strategy. They protect our inventions around the world. We shape and reposition our patent portfolio \nto cover emerging and other technologies that drive our core businesses. Software, which is important to all of our businesses, but is \nespecially central to the IP position of the Electrification businesses, is protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, and contractual \nprotections.\nWe protect our trade secrets and confidential know-how by actively enforcing our internal policies for data classification and protection and \nby requiring and enforcing specific innovation and proprietary information agreements and \nnon-disclosure agreements\n. We also utilize \ncontemporary cybersecurity tools and systems, as well as physical security measures, that safeguard our most valuable data from insider \nthreats and third-party concentrated efforts to misappropriate our IP. See Item 1C. \"Cybersecurity\" for further information. \nWhile our patents and other IP protections are important to our operations, we do not consider any single IP asset or group of assets to be \nof material significance to any of our financial segments or our businesses as a whole. However, we believe that we derive a sustained \ncompetitive advantage both from our IP portfolio as well as technical know-how embedded in our products and manufacturing techniques \ndeveloped over decades. We further believe that our understanding of our customers’ needs, technology expertise, and manufacturing \nknow-how are critical to our business.\nIn addition to our IP portfolio, we have a license to use certain IP from GE Aerospace, including the GE name and the GE Monogram. The \nlicense applies to our products and services, as well as to natural extensions and evolutions thereof. \nSee “Certain Relationships and \nRelated Person Transactions—Agreements with GE—Agreements Governing Intellectual Property” in our information statement dated \nMarch 8, 2024, which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K furnished with the SEC on March 8, 2024 (the \nInformation Statement).\nGLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN. \nAnnually, we purchase approximately $20 billion in materials and components sourced from over 100 \ncountries. \nWe face various supply chain challenges, many of which are industry-wide or arise from geopolitical and economic conditions \nbeyond our control. These include global conflicts, global economic trends, geopolitical dynamics like sanctions, \ntariffs and\n other trade \ntensions, inflation, logistics issues, human rights landscape shifts, and regulatory changes. Additionally, potential disruptions such as \nnatural disasters and other extreme\n weather conditions, global \npandemics, and cyber-attacks could significantly impact our operations, \nfinancial performance, and ability to meet customer commitments.\nTo address these challenges, we maintain strong supplier relationships and prioritize opportunities to localize our supply chain to serve our \ndistinct geographies, while at the same time allowing us to maintain a globally diverse supply chain for operational resiliency. Our risk-\nbased supplier onboarding process involves thorough due diligence, focusing on performance, labor standards, ethical sourcing, and \nhuman rights, supported by an audit program. \nWe are expanding these efforts to consider environmental impact and environmental, social \nand governance (\nESG)\n regulations, along with alignment to our GE Vernova sustainability framework.\nInternally, we manage risks through cyber mitigation, business continuity planning, and crisis management. We have developed cross-\nbusiness councils for supply chain and procurement to proactively share best practices around supply chain resiliency. We are also \nenhancing our risk management tools to leverage technology for better market trend analysis and risk mitigation concerning commodity \npricing, availability, lead-times, country specific tariff \nimpacts, and\n ESG compliance. Specifically, to minimize inflationary impacts, we have a \nsourcing process to monitor commodity price fluctuations across the ferrous, non-ferrous, precious metals, and energy commodities. We \ncontinue to employ and evolve lean practices across our operations to enhance safety, quality, and delivery performance, building new \ncapabilities to scale our supply chain aligned to our business growth.\nHUMAN CAPITAL. \nGE Vernova is a global workforce of approximately 75,000 employees, with approximately 70% of our employees \nspecializing in manufacturing, engineering, or services. In addition, we have approximately 1,800 employees in Quality or environmental, \nhealth, and safety (EHS) roles, critical disciplines for our success as a company. Our culture enables us to deliver on our purpose and drive \nperformance. We operate according to a set of shared principles that guide how we aspire to speak, behave, interact, and make decisions. \nWe call these five principles the GE Vernova Way:\n•\nWe drive \ninnovation\n in everything we do to electrify and decarbonize the world.\n•\nWe serve our \ncustomers\n with pride and a focus on mutual success and long-term impact.\n•\nWe challenge ourselves to be better every day; \nl\nean\n \nis how we work.\n•\nWe break boundaries and cross borders to win as \none team\n.\n•\nWe remain \naccountable\n individually and collectively to deliver on our purpose and commitments.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n8\nAs we strive to live the GE Vernova Way, we create a more respectful, inclusive culture where we can each contribute to meaningful work. \nAdditional human capital priorities include:\n•\nProtecting the health and safety of our workforce and contractors.\n•\nDriving continuous improvement and eliminating waste through lean.\n•\nOperating as one GE Vernova.\n•\nDriving sustainable high performance.\n•\nAttracting and developing talent with the variety of skills to innovate and grow our business; fostering an inclusive culture.\nWe trace our beginnings to the \nEdison General Electric Company, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric \nlighting devices. We carry forward that legacy today as a developer, manufacturer, and service provider of power generating and \ndecarbonizing solutions. GE Vernova’s portfolio also includes Advanced Research with hundreds of technologists and cross-discipline \nexperts focused on enabling ground-breaking innovations destined to shape the energy transition.\nOur footprint is tr\nuly global with ap\nproximately 24,000 employees in Europe, 19,000 employees in the U.S., 18,000 employees in Asia, and \n7,000 employees in Latin America. GE Vernova’s relationship with employee-representative organizations around the world takes many \nforms.\n•\nWithin the U.S., we have approximately 1,300 union-represented production and maintenance employees who are covered by a \nfour-year collective bargaining agreement that was ratified for a two-year extension in 2023 and expires in June of 2025.\n•\nIn Europe, we engage with approximately 100 representative organizations such as works councils and trade unions, in \naccordance with local law. Social dialogue, including information, consultation, and negotiation, is a key component of doing \nbusiness in Europe and a driver of sustainable business growth for us in the region.\n•\nIn addition to the U.S. and Europe, we also engage with employee representative bodies in China (2,200 employees), India (2,000 \nemployees), Canada (700 employees), Brazil (600 employees), and Mexico (150 employees).\nWe strive to build and maintain productive relationships with all trade unions and employee-representative organizations with which we \nengage. More broadly, our relationship \nwith every employee\n, regardless of functional discipline, geography or representation status, is a \npriority. The purpose, passion, and expertise our employees embody every day is fundamental to providing essential electricity around the \nworld and for the future of our environment. It is our mission to inspire, engage, and develop our employees to their fullest potential.\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY MATTERS. \nGE Vernova is committed to providing and promoting a safe and healthy \nworking environmen\nt, using natural resources and energy in a sustainable way, \nand avoiding an adverse impact to employees and \ncontractors, our customers, the \nenvironment, and\n the communities where we do business. We support our customers by maintaining the \nhighest standards in safeguarding our employees, our contracting partners, and the environment.\nIn addition to our own internal e\nnterprise standards and core requirements\n on various \nEHS\n topics, we are subject to international, national, \nstate, and local EHS laws, regulations, and industry and customer standards, including EHS licensing and authorization requirements. \nThese EHS laws apply to a broad range of activities across our whole product lifecycle and our entire global organization, including those \nrelated to:\n•\nprotection of the environment and use of natural resources;\n•\noccupational health and safety;\n•\nthe use, management, release, storage, transportation, r\nemediation, and\n disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances and \nwaste;\n•\nour products, including the use of certain chemicals in our products and production processes;\n•\nemissions to air and water; and\n•\nclimate change and greenhouse gas emissions.\nEHS laws vary by jurisdiction and have become increasingly stringent over time. These requirements impose certain responsibilities on our \nbusiness, including the obligation to install pollution control technologies and obtain and maintain various environmental permits, the cost of \nwhich may be substantial. Satisfying such local EHS requirements is often a minimum requirement for us, and we commit extensive \nresources to maintaining our compliance with these requirements. For example, by applying our enterprise standards and core \nrequirements everywhere (except where local regulations are more stringent), we often go beyond local compliance requirements, \nespecially where local standards are weak or lacking. Safety is incorporated into our\n lean\n operating method and we prioritize safeguarding \nour employees and contractors. We also enhance our internal enterprise standards and core requirements regularly through a culture of \ncontinuous improvement and documenting opportunities to improve through internal and external audits.\nOur EHS management system includes measures to verify that we are monitoring adherence to GE Vernova EHS standards and regulatory \nrequirements through audits and inspections. Operations are assessed on a regular basis as part of our management of change \n(MOC)\n \nprocess to mitigate safety risks. EHS operational reviews at both the business and GE Vernova level address progress on program \nexecution as well as strategy discussions related to emerging EHS risks.\nREGULATION\n. \nWe are a manufacturer and servicer of energy products, a participant in the energy supply chain, a large publicly traded \nU.S. corporation that operates globally, a government contractor, and an employer of a large global workforce.

These registered entities are subject to a \nnumber of laws and regulations from the SEC, \nFINRA, and\n state securities regulators, as applicable, which impose \nvarious compliance, disclosure, qualification, recordkeeping, reporting, and other requirements. In addition, under the \nAdvisers Act, our registered investment adviser entity has fiduciary duties to its clients, is subject to restrictions on its \nability to engage in principal and agency cross transactions, and may be inspected by the SEC to determine whether we \nare conducting our activities in compliance with applicable law. \n•\nParticipant in the Global Energy Supply Chain.\n As a participant in the global energy \nsupply\n chain, our businesses and \noperations must comply with global sanctions regimes, as well as an increasing number of global laws and regulations that extend \nto our sourcing, purchasing, and life cycles. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each \nof the countries where we operate. Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against \ncertain countries, persons, and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons, and entities, \nwhich may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. The scope of these regulations extends to product \ncircularity and extended producer responsibility, sustainability disclosure requirements such as the EU Corporate Sustainability \nReporting Directive (CSRD), carbon emissions (including the EU Carbon Board Adjustment Mechanism), labor and employment, \ndeforestation (such as the EU Deforestation Act), human rights due diligence, modern slavery, forced labor, child labor, supply \nchain due diligence including the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and whistleblower directives. In \naddition to complying with such regulations with respect to our own operations, a growing number of sourcing regulations apply \nthese regulatory requirements across our full value chain, including global regulations about human rights and environmental due \ndiligence conducted with respect to suppliers. \n•\nGovernment Contractor. \nMany of our sales are made to U.S. or foreign governments, regulated entities such as public utilities, \nstate-owned companies, and other public sector customers. These types of sales often entail additional compliance obligations, \nsuch as public procurement laws.\n For example, a bidder may be required to demonstrate that it has been active as a local \nregistered company or has sufficient capitalization or technical qualifications. \nFor contracts with the U.S. federal government, with \ncertain exceptions, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and applicable agency rules, regulations governing \nFederal Financial Assistance Agreements, rules and regulations issued by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, \nthe Procurement Integrity Act, the Buy American Act, the Trade Agreements Act, and/or presidential executive orders. The U.S. \nfederal government could invoke the Defense Production Act, requiring that we accept and prioritize contracts for materials \ndeemed necessary for national defense, regardless of loss in revenue incurred on such contracts. From time to time, we may also \nneed to comply with the EU’s Foreign Subsidies Regulation, which imposes mandatory notification and approval requirements on \ncompanies bidding on large public tenders in the EU. \n2024 FORM 10-K \n10\n•\nGlobal, Publicly Traded Energy Company.\n As a publicly traded company in the U.S, we are subject to the laws and regulations \nof the SEC as well as the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, on which our common stock is listed\n.\n As a global enterprise \noperating in over 100 countries, we must abide by laws and regulations applicable to entities across many jurisdictions, including \nthose governing antitrust and competition, as well as: \n◦\nCybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Artificial Intelligence.\n We are subject to rapidly evolving laws and regulations governing \ncybersecurity and data privacy in many jurisdictions, including those imposed by federal and state regulators in the U.S., \nsuch as the Federal Trade Commission and state agencies, and the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. \nAdditional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our \nbusiness. \nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\nRisks Relating to Operations and Supply Chain\nWe provide complex and specialized products, solutions, and services, and we could be adversely affected by actual or \nperceived quality issues or safety failures. \nWe produce highly sophisticated and leading-edge products and provide specialized \nsolutions and services for complex technology and engineered products and projects, including both products and software. Many of our \nproducts, solutions, and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as gas turbines, onshore and \noffshore wind turbines, grid infrastructure, or nuclear power generation. A serious product or execution failure could result in a range of \nadverse outcomes, including injuries or death, widespread power outages, suspension of power production, installation or fleet delivery \ndelays, environmental impacts, or similar systemic issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial \nposition, cash flows, and results of operations. Actual or perceived design, production, performance, or other quality issues related to new \nproduct introductions or existing product lines have resulted and can result in direct warranty, maintenance, and other claims for damages, \nincluding costs associated with project delays, repairs, or replacements, some of which have been and can in the future be for significant \namounts. For example, during the summer of 2024, a wind turbine blade event occurred, related to a manufacturing deviation, at the \nVineyard Wind offshore wind farm where we are the manufacturer and supplier of our newly developed Haliade-X 220m wind turbines \n(Halia\nde-X). See Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Offshore Wind\" for \nadditional information. \nQuality issues can also result in reputational harm to our business with a potential loss of attractiveness of our \nproducts, solutions, and services to new and existing customers. A widespread fleet issue could result in revenue loss while the associated \nproduct is suspended from operation. This risk is pronounced in connection with the introduction of new technology. For example, due to \nthe difficulties associated with scaling up production of new products and components, the challenges of servicing our substantial installed \nfleet of onshore wind turbines and the difficulties of servicing our offshore wind turbines, a widespread fleet product quality issue with our \nwind turbines could cause us to incur substantial costs and could take significant time to address. Additionally, many of our products, \nsolutions, and services function under demanding operating conditions and meet exacting certification, performance, and reliability \nstandards that we, our customers, or regulators adopt. Developing and maintaining products, solutions, and services that meet or exceed \nthese standards can be costly and technologically challenging and require extensive coordination of our suppliers and team members at \nour technology, manufacturing, and remote project sites in both developed and developing markets around the world. Failures to deliver \nproducts, solutions, and services that meet these standards, whether actual or perceived, have resulted and may in the future result in \ncustomers or other third parties asserting contractual or other claims, often for significant amounts, or regulators suspending installation or \noperations, which could have significant adverse financial, competitive, or reputational effects.\nOur products contain and are integrated with products from third parties. From time to time, the processes used to ensure the quality of \nthose third-party products may fail to detect defects. Despite the operational processes around product design, manufacture, performance, \nand servicing that we and our customers or other third parties have developed to meet rigorous quality standards, the risk of operational \nprocess or product failures and other problems cannot be eliminated. Such problems could result in increased costs, delayed payments, \nlost products or services revenue, and product, safety, quality, regulatory, or environmental risks, which could have an adverse effect on our \nfinancial results.\nIf our ongoing efforts to achieve our anticipated operational cost savings and implement initiatives to control or reduce our \noperating costs are not successful, our financial results and cash flows may be adversely affected. \nAchieving our long-term \nfinancial results and cash flow goals depends significantly on our ability to control and/ or reduce our operating costs. Generally, because \nmany of our costs are affected by factors completely, or substantially outside our control, we must seek to control or reduce costs through \nproductivity initiatives. We seek continued cost savings through lean operations and supply chain management. While controlling our cost \nbase is important for our business and future competitiveness, there is no guarantee that we will achieve this goal. Additionally, cost \nsavings anticipated by us are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be subject to significant business, \neconomic and competitive uncertainties, and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control. For example, \nthe rapid pace of innovation among onshore and offshore wind turbine manufacturers in recent years has led to short product cycles, early \nmarket introductions, and faster time to market, all of which have and can lead to quality and execution issues, higher costs, or other \n2024 FORM 10-K \n12\nchallenges to achieving profitability for new products. Such risks are especially acute in the offshore wind industry, which is a nascent \nindustry, with higher ramp up costs and the potential for new product introductions to result in losses both in the short-and in the long-run. \nSee Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Offshore Wind\" for a description \nof recent quality and execution issues we have experienced at our Offshore Wind projects. If we are not able to identify and implement \ninitiatives that control and/or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date \ndo not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe enter into long-term service agreements in connection with significant contracts for the sale of products, particularly in our Gas Power \nbusiness unit. In connection with these agreements, we estimate our products’ durability and reliability, as well as our costs associated with \ndelivering the products and the provision of services over time in order to be profitable and generate acceptable returns on our investments. \nParticularly for our long-cycle businesses and contracts like these, a failure to appropriately estimate, plan for, or execute our business \nplans may adversely affect our delivery of products, services, and outcomes in line with our projected financial performance or cost \nestimates, and ultimately may result in excess costs, build-up of inventory that becomes obsolete, lower profit margins and cash flows, and \nan erosion of our competitive position.\nSignificant disruptions in our supply chain, including the high cost or unavailability of raw materials, components, and products \nessential to our business, and significant disruptions to our manufacturing and production facilities and distribution networks \ncould adversely affect our future financial results, and our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis. \nOur reliance on third-\nparty suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers, and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components, and \nsub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials, parts, components, systems, and \nservices. As our supply chains extend into many different countries and regions of the world, including many developing economies, we are \nalso subject to global economic and geopolitical dynamics, including tariffs, and risks associated with exporting or importing components \nand raw materials for completing the construction or incorporation process in other countries.\nWe operate in a supply-constrained environment and have faced, are facing, and may in the future face, supply-chain shortages, \ninflationary pressures, shortages of skilled labor, transportation and logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our \nrevenues, profitability, cash flow, and timeliness in fulfilling customer orders. To manage the impact of supply chain shortages and \ninflationary pressures, we have sought, and may continue to seek, to negotiate long-term agreements with suppliers, develop relationships \nwith alternative suppliers, drive productivity initiatives in our manufacturing operations, provide training to our employees, develop alternate \ntransportation routes, modes, and providers, and share rising costs with our customers. While these measures have successfully mitigated \nagainst historical impact, we expect supply chain pressures across our businesses will continue to challenge and adversely affect our \noperations and financial performance for some period of time. In addition, some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited-or sole-\nsource suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality, and stability of such \nsuppliers. Generally, raw materials and components are available from a number of different suppliers, although we rely on a single \nsupplier, a small number of suppliers, or suppliers located in a single country for certain materials and components, including for example \nsome semiconductor chips, cobalt, certain steel, hafnium, and other rare earth metals. We have in the past experienced, and in the future \nmay experience, disruptions related to availability of components and materials sourced from single suppliers, but the impact to our \noperations and financial results of such disruptions have not been material. However, if one of these suppliers were unable to provide us \nwith a raw material or component we need, our ability to manufacture some of our products or provide some of our services could be \nadversely affected if and to the extent that we are unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable period of time or on \ncommercially reasonable terms in light of the circumstances.\nDisruptions in deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up-or down-stream, price increases, cyber- related attacks, or \ndecreased availability of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war, natural disasters, actual or threatened public health \nemergencies, increased tariffs or import or export restrictions, or other business continuity events, adversely affect our operations and, \ndepending on the length and severity of the disruption, could limit our ability to manufacture products on a timely basis and could harm our \nfinancial results. Additionally, nonperformance or underperformance by third-party suppliers could materially impact our ability to perform \nobligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating their contract with us, exposing us to liability, and substantially \nimpairing our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nFurthermore, we depend on multiple routes and modes of transport to acquire components and materials used in our operations. We are \nvulnerable to disruptions in transport and logistics activities due to weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts, inadequacy of roadways, \ntransportation infrastructure and port facilities, hostilities, acts of terrorism, or other events. We are also subject to fluctuations in the costs \nof transportation. We may be unable to store components and materials sufficient for more than a limited period of production, which \nincreases our dependence on efficient logistics. In addition, during transport and shipping, our products and/or their components and \nmaterials may become damaged. Such factors could also result in liability and significant reputational harm. These factors could adversely \nimpact our ability to deliver quality products, solutions, and services to our customers and may have a substantial adverse impact on our \nbusiness activities, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nAny interruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities may impair our ability to deliver or provide products, solutions, \nand services. \nWe are dependent on our global production and operating network to develop, manufacture, assemble, supply, and service \nour offerings. A work stoppage, labor shortage, or other production limitation, including i\nmport or export restrictions\n, or transportation \nissues, among others, could adversely affect our manufacturing facilities and negatively impact our reputation and market position. In \naddition, manufacturing disruptions related to significant public health and safety events, severe weather, financial distress, unscheduled \ndowntimes, manufacturing deviations, quality issues, production constraints, mechanical failures, cybersecurity attacks, and geopolitical \ndynamics and risks could interrupt our ability to deliver or provide certain products, solutions, and services. Such risks may be heightened \nin emerging market countries, which may be subject to varying degrees of economic, political, and social instability.\nWe also have internal dependencies on certain key manufacturing or other facilities. For example, our Onshore and Offshore Wind \nbusinesses are, and may in the future be, reliant on our internal ability to manufacture blades for wind turbines through our LM Wind Power \nbusiness, which accounts for a substantial percentage of our wind blade production. Similarly, we internally manufacture certain specialized \ntransformers for our Grid Solutions business. If we are unable to produce or assemble these components internally in sufficient quantities, \n2024 FORM 10-K \n13\ndue to disturbances at a certain production location or for any other reason, we may be forced to increase the volume of wind turbine \nblades or transformers purchased from external suppliers which could lead to delays, quality control issues, or additional costs.\nAny significant event affecting one of our production or operating facilities may result in a disruption to our ability to supply customers. The \nimpact of these risks is heightened if our production capacity is at or near full utilization (or if we lack alternative manufacturing sites) and \ncould result in our inability to accept orders or deliver products in a timely manner. Additionally, significant capital investment to increase \nmanufacturing capacity may be required to expand our business or meet increased demand for existing or newly introduced products in the \nfuture. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.\nOur failure to manage customer relationships and customer contracts could adversely affect our financial results. \nAn important \nelement of our success is our ability to manage customer relationships, while delivering against our contractual requirements and \nanticipating changes in customer requirements and circumstances. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase \nour products, solutions, and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely \nfashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages, shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of projects or \ntechnologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies), macroeconomic conditions, changes in law, \ndisputes, or other delays. If a large customer was to experience difficulties in fulfilling its obligations to us, cease doing business with us, \nsignificantly reduce the amount of its purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, change its purchasing patterns, or impose \nunexpected fees on us, our business may be harmed. In addition, many of our customer contracts are complex and contain warranty and \nother provisions that could cause us to incur significant repair or replacement costs, penalties, liquidated or other damages, and/or \nunanticipated expenses with respect to the timely delivery, functionality, quality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products, \nsolutions, and services. For example, we face risks in our Wind business related to our ability to assemble and deliver specific components \nsuch as nacelles on the timelines and schedules detailed and otherwise comply with our customer contracts. Failure to adhere to \nrequirements under our customer agreements, whether such failure is actual or alleged, has resulted in and could in the future result in \nhigher potential costs, present litigation risks, or expose us to liquidated or other damages.\nOur customers include numerous governmental owned or affiliated entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal \ngovernment and state and local entities. Some of those contracts could be subject to the risk of delay, modification, or termination if future \ngovernment funding or support is not available. We also at times face greater challenges with the timely collection of receivables with \ncustomers that are sovereign governments, government owned entities, or customers located in emerging markets.\nOur ability to maintain our investment grade credit ratings could affect our ability to access capital, could increase our interest \nrates, and could limit our ability to secure new contracts or business opportunities. \nThe success of our commercial relationships is \npredicated on our ability to maintain our corporate investment grade ratings. Our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating \nagencies. Any future downgrades of our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing of any indebtedness we may incur. Adverse \nchanges in our investment grade credit ratings could affect our borrowing and bonding capacity and terms in the future, may increase our \ninterest expense or other costs of capital, or capital may not be available to us on competitive terms, or at all, and may reduce our ability to \nsecure new contracts or business opportunities with operating partners, suppliers, and customers, each of which would negatively impact \nour financial performance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any changes or downgrades \nrelated to our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact \non our liquidity, capital position, bonding capacity, and access to credit.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts with our customers and our failure to mitigate certain risks associated with such contracts \nmay result in reduced operating margins. \nSome of our contracts have been established on a fixed-price basis which commit us to a \nspecific price well before the completion of the applicable project. However, actual revenues or costs may be different from those we \noriginally estimated and may result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Some of these risks include:\n•\ndifficulties encountered on our large-scale projects related to the procurement of materials or due to schedule disruptions, product \nperformance failures, unforeseen site conditions, rejection clauses in customer contracts, or other factors that may result in \nadditional costs to us, reductions in revenue, claims, or disputes;\n•\nour inability to obtain compensation for additional work we perform or expenses we incur as a result of unanticipated technical \nissues or our customers providing deficient design, engineering information, products, or materials;\n•\nreliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current conditions, including as a result of inflation \nand increases in labor and material costs;\n•\ndelays or productivity issues caused by weather conditions, or other force majeure events (e.g., pandemics);\n•\nrequirements to pay liquidated or other damages, upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts;\n•\ndifficulties in engaging third-party subcontractors, product manufacturers, or materials suppliers or failures by third-party \nsubcontractors, product manufacturers, or materials suppliers to perform could result in project delays and cause us to incur \nadditional costs; and\n•\nmodifications to projects that create unanticipated costs or delays.\nAs a result of one or more of these factors, we may incur losses or contracts may not be as profitable as we expect, and this could \nmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Industry Dynamics\nThe strategic priorities and financial performance of many of our businesses are subject to market and other dynamics related to \ndecarbonization, which can pose risks in addition to opportunities. \nGiven the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve, \nwe must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory, governmental policy, and other changes driven by broader trends \nrelated to decarbonization efforts in response to climate change and energy security. In particular, we provide products, solutions, and \nservices to utilities and other customers in the power generation sector, which has historically been carbon intensive and has been in the \nmidst of a transition with global efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the significant decreases in recent years in the \ncost of energy for renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in government, investor, \n2024 FORM 10-K \n14\ncustomer and consumer policies, commitments, preferences, and considerations related to climate change, in some cases have adversely \naffected, and may continue to affect, the demand for and the competitiveness of products, solutions, and services related to fossil fuel-\nbased power generation, including sales of new gas turbines and the utilization and servicing needs for existing gas power plants that are \nunmitigated with capabilities such as hydrogen or carbon capture. Conversely, increased government policy focus on fossil fuel generation \nand use, and reversion of existing policies to facilitate implementation of renewable energy sources in the various jurisdictions in which our \nproducts are sold, may result in reduced demand for our renewable energy products and services, including decarbonization.\nContinued shifts toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity additions and the proportionate share of power generation, \nparticularly depending on the pace and timeframe for such shifts across different industries globally, could have a material adverse effect on \nthe performance of our Power segment and our consolidated results. We also face risks and uncertainties for those businesses related to \nfuture levels and timeframes of government subsidies and credits (including the impact of the IRA in the U.S. and other U.S. and global \npolicies), timeframes for negotiations with regulators, significant price competition among product manufacturers, competition with solar \npower-based and other sources of renewable energy, the risk that a segment of the renewable energy industry may be deprioritized, the \npace at which power grids are modernized to maintain reliability with higher levels of renewables penetration, and industry-wide shifts in \nprofitability levels.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address both electrification and decarbonization, which over time will require \nadapting our technology portfolio to changing customer preferences and government policies and scaling innovative low-carbon and \ncarbon-neutral technologies. If we fail or are perceived to not be adequately advancing decarbonization objectives, or if investors or \nfinancial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our and our customers’ access to capital could be \nnegatively impacted. Furthermore, governments may enact or implement policies that impact these dynamics as they pertain to us or our \ncustomers in unforeseeable ways. The achievement of decarbonization goals for the electric power industry over the coming decades is \nalso likely to depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but that may become more important over \ntime (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, small modular or other advanced nuclear \npower and grid-scale batteries or other storage solutions). Successfully navigating these changes will require significant investments in \npower grids and other infrastructure, R&D, and new technology and products, both by us and third parties. Our success in advancing \ndecarbonization objectives across our businesses will also depend in part on the actions of governments, regulators and other market \nparticipants to invest in infrastructure, create appropriate market incentives and to otherwise support the development of new technologies \nin time to take advantage of existing or emerging market opportunities. Considering the above, there is no assurance that we will be \nsuccessful in addressing effectively either electrification or decarbonization.\nThe process of developing new high-technology products and enhancing existing products to address the impact of climate change is often \ncomplex, costly and uncertain, and we may pursue strategies or make investments that do not prove to be commercially successful in the \ntimeframes expected or at all. If the decarbonization landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, \ndemand for our products, solutions, and services could be adversely affected.\nDemand\n for certain of our products, solutions, and services, particularly in our Power segment, depend on oil and gas regulatory \npolicy, prices and global and regional supply and demand, and technological innovations and efficiencies, which are subject to \nfactors beyond our control and may adversely affect our operating results. \nDemand for certain of our products, solutions, and \nservices, particularly in our Power segment, is partially affected by oil and gas regulatory policy, prices, and demand for oil and, in \nparticular, gas, which are subject to factors beyond our control. Several U.S. and international pledges, agreements, and initiatives, such as \nthose adopted at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (\nCOP28\n), resulted in more stringent regulations on oil and gas \noperations, which could impact production costs, reduce oil and gas demand, and curtail future investments in gas turbine generation. The \noil and gas segment could also experience a reduction in utilization by the switch away from gas to other sources of energy if prices for \nsuch alternative sources are lower than those for gas. \nEnergy prices could impact many of our customers’ cash flows and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Because \nprices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis, the volatility in oil and gas prices and demand can impact our customers’ \nactivity levels and spending for our products, solutions, and services. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for \ndetermining future spending levels. Actual and anticipated increases in oil and gas prices (and corresponding low demand for oil and gas) \nhave in the past contributed to, and may in the future contribute to, an overall economic recession, which may raise risks across our \nindustries. During these periods, certain countries that are heavily dependent on income from oil and gas may curtail investments in capital \nintensive oil and gas, power generation and transmission projects due to insufficient funds, which would also lead to less demand for \ncertain of our products, solutions, and services in our Power segment. Furthermore, persistently high gas prices as well as potential gas \nshortages, which may be further exacerbated by the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, pose additional risks in particular for the \nmarket for large gas turbines, including the service market.\nEnergy intensive technological innovations and efficiencies, such as artificial intelligence, may affect or may be perceived to affect \nelectricity demand and the related demand for our equipment and services. The nature and extent of this impact on demand is uncertain. \nWe may be unable to adjust our personnel and functional cost base fast enough to adapt to demand swings, which may result in under-or-\novercapacities. This inefficiency as well as sustained low demand for our products, solutions, and services, particularly in our Power \nsegment, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, cash flows, and results of operations and could require \nus to record asset impairments.\nWe could be subject to risks in connection with our ability to connect to power grids and our customers’ ability to sell the \nelectricity they generate or to establish grid connections efficiently. \nThe connection or access to a power grid is essential when it \ncomes to generating electricity. Factors beyond our control, such as regulatory constraints, permitting restrictions and delays, or system \nfailures, could impair our ability to connect our power generation products to the grid. If our customers fail to obtain a connection or access \nto the transmission grids on a timely basis, or on economically reasonable terms and, as a result, they are delayed or prevented from \nentering into an agreement (whether on a statutory or contractual basis) concerning the purchase of the electrical energy generated, the \ntiming of orders and/or project milestones could be impacted, and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of \n2024 FORM 10-K \n15\noperations, cash flows, and financial condition. Grid capacity constraints and the limited availability of land to build connection infrastructure \ncould further exacerbate the risks to our business.\nThere are statutory rules and regulations which govern the connection of power generation products to the power grid in the markets where \nwe operate. This helps ensure that grids are safe and stable and that there is sufficient supply of electricity. Moreover, the full transmission \nand dispatch output of electricity may be curtailed as a result of various grid constraints, such as grid congestion, restrictions on \ntransmission capacity of the grid and restrictions on electricity dispatch during certain periods. Electricity transmission lines may experience \nunplanned outages due to system failures, accidents and severe weather conditions, or planned outages due to repair and maintenance, \nconstruction work and other reasons beyond our control. For example, as electricity generated from wind farms today is currently often not \nstored and must be transmitted or used once it is generated, some of the wind turbines of a wind farm may be turned off during such period \nwhen electricity is unable to be transmitted due to grid congestion or other grid constraints. Such events could reduce the actual net power \ngeneration of the wind farms. In addition, a number of other factors may further decrease electricity output, including wind speed or wind \ndirection or other severe weather condition.\nAs a result, we and our customers may experience significant financial losses from inefficient electricity outputs, the inability to connect to \npower grids, or grid capacity constraints, which may in turn cause the decrease in the demand for our products and could lead to a material \nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nSome of our operations involve the handling, use, transportation, and disposal of radioactive and hazardous materials, which \nsubject us and our customers to regulations, related costs and delays and potential liabilities for injuries and claims. \nOur \noperations involve the handling, use, transportation, and disposal of radioactive and hazardous materials, including nuclear fuel, nuclear \npower devices and their components. The risks associated with radioactive materials and the public perception of those risks can affect our \nbusiness. Failure to properly handle radioactive and hazardous materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause \npersonal injury, property damage (including environmental contamination), and damage the health and safety of the surrounding \ncommunity. If an accident were to occur, its severity could be significantly affected by the nature of the accident and the speed of corrective \naction taken by us and others, including emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and \nwind conditions. In addition to health risks, a release of these materials may cause damage to, or the loss of, property and may adversely \naffect property values. Actions taken in response to an accident could result in significant costs. Activities of our contractors, suppliers or \nother counterparties similarly may involve toxic, hazardous, and radioactive materials and we may be liable contractually, or under \napplicable law, to contribute to remedy damages or other costs arising from such activities.\nAdverse public reaction to developments in the use of nuclear power or nuclear radiation could directly affect our customers and indirectly \naffect our business. Adverse public reaction, increased regulatory scrutiny, and potential litigation and other legal challenges could \ncontribute to a slowdown in, or in some cases, a complete halt to new construction of nuclear power plants, an early shut down of existing \npower plants, delays or resistance to reopening power plants that have been shut down, or a dampening of the favorable regulatory climate \nneeded to introduce new nuclear technologies. Negative public perceptions could also lead to increased regulation or limitations on the \nactivities of our customers, more onerous operating requirements, or other conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our \ncustomers and our business.\nWe are subject to international, federal, state, and local regulations governing handling, use, transportation, and disposal of radioactive and \nhazardous materials. These requirements are complex and subject to frequent change. Our compliance with amended, new, or more \nstringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, or the future discovery of contamination may require us to make \nmaterial expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. Such expenditures and liabilities may adversely affect \nour business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe seek to protect ourselves from liability associated with accidents through contractual precautions with our counterparties, but there can \nbe no assurance that such contractual limitations on liability will be effective in all cases or that our or our counterparties’ insurance will \ncover all the liabilities we have assumed under those contracts. While we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk \nmanagement strategy, these policies do not protect us against all liabilities associated with accidents or for unrelated claims. The costs of \ndefending against a claim arising out of an incident involving radioactive or hazardous materials, such as a precautionary evacuation, and \nany damages awarded as a result of such a claim, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWind energy is a variable source of electricity and is susceptible to the impacts of weather conditions and other seasonal factors \nand constraints. \nDue to the variable availability of wind energy, coupled with various transmission limitations, such as grid congestion \ncaused by the underdevelopment of the local power grids and temporary transmission interruptions caused by system upgrades, wind \npower may not be a viable base load source of electricity. As such, while demand for wind power is expected to increase, there are \nchallenges to wind power becoming a large-scale substitute for other energy sources unless special technologies (e.g., energy storage) are \ndeveloped to ensure a more stable and reliable output of electricity generated by the wind power industry. We cannot be certain that our \nefforts to develop and introduce advanced wind technologies will be successful, or how successful wind power will be as a larger share of \ntotal power generation over a long horizon. If future developments or innovations in the wind power industry are less successful than those \nof other energy sources, there may be a negative impact on the future prospects of the wind power industry, which, in turn, could materially \nand adversely affect the demand for our products, solutions, services, and platforms.\nThe generation of wind power depends on wind conditions and patterns, which are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict or anticipate. \nSales of our wind turbines and the provision of related technical services are subject to seasonal variations since the delivery and \ninstallation of our wind turbines depend on the construction cycles of wind farm projects by our customers. The installation and \nmaintenance of offshore wind turbines can be particularly impacted by weather-related scheduling delays due to their complex \ninfrastructure, higher wind speeds, and the challenges of accessing offshore sites. Adverse events relating to our wind business operations \nduring peak demand periods can create unpredictability in activity and utilization rates and affect demand for our support services. \nFurthermore, wind turbine specifications must be suitable for the wind conditions expected at a particular site. Therefore, unavailability of \nlocations that are suitable for the wind turbines we offer would have a negative impact on our sales and thus materially adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n16\nRisks Relating to Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Conditions\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with the volatile global economic environment and geopolitical conditions. \nAdverse \nchanges in economic or geopolitical conditions, particularly in locations where our customers, suppliers, or operations are located, as well \nas concerns about a range of other external factors including global trade and global supply chain, developments in energy prices, inflation, \ninterest rates, changes in government monetary or fiscal policies, import or export restrictions, tariffs, labor market challenges, \ncurrenc\ny \nexchange rate volatility, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition and \nmay adversely impact the demand for our products, solutions, and services. Rising inflation and interest rates may increase our cost of \ncapital and could reduce the number of customers who purchase our products, solutions, and services as credit becomes more expensive \nor less available. The consequences of geopolitical conflicts, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflicts in the \nMiddle East, and possible conflicts that could emerge in other geopolitically sensitive areas, such as the Taiwan Strait and broader Asia \nPacific region, which have resulted in sanctions and other measures imposed by the EU, the U.S., and other countries in response, have \nalso caused and may continue to cause disruption and instability in global markets, supply chains and industries that negatively impact our \nbusinesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and pose reputational risks. In addition, our customers and suppliers \ncould be affected directly by an economic downturn and some could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to \npayment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could adversely impact customer demand for our \nproducts as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity \nand duration, the effects and consequences of global economic and political conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of \noperations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nUnexpected events, such as natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, pandemics, and other events beyond our control, may \nincrease our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations. \nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including \ngeopolitical conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the conflicts in the Middle East), acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, \nfires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in regions in which we operate or in which \nour suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, product failures, power \noutages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing \nfacilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from local and international \nsuppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to project sites and distribution centers. A public health epidemic or \npandemic poses the risk that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other business partners may be prevented from \nconducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns, travel restrictions, or other actions that may be \nrequested or mandated by governmental authorities, or that such epidemic or pandemic may otherwise interrupt or impair business \nactivities. Our operations and financial performance were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that caused a slowdown of \neconomic activity, disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Existing insurance \ncoverage may not provide protection for all the costs that may arise from such events, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased \ncosts of, such insurance. In addition, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our \ninformation technology systems), they may not be fully responsive to, or capable of eliminating or materially minimizing losses associated \nwith, catastrophic events. As a result, any business disruption could still negatively affect our business, operating results, cash flows, or \nfinancial condition.\nPolitical and economic instability, restrictive trade policies, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, and export and import restrictions may \ndisrupt our supply chain and impact our ability to generate products, solutions, and services to meet customer demands. The prices of raw \nmaterials and other components that we use in production may increase and be susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in \nsupply and demand, commodity prices, currency exchange rates, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, price controls, \nand economic conditions, among other factors. In addition, various geopolitical factors, including the level of economic activity in China, the \nconflict in Ukraine, and the conflicts in the Middle East, have added to the volatility in energy costs. These circumstances may have a \nsubstantial adverse impact on our business activities, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected by any negative impact on\n \nthe global economy and financial markets resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n Global markets\n \nexperienced volatility and disruption as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Although the length and impact of the\n \nongoing conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine has contributed and could continue to contribute to volatility in global\n \nfinancial markets, energy costs, and commodity prices and exacerbate existing supply chain constraints. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine\n \nhas led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union, and other countries against Russia. Additional\n \npotential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Our business and financial performance have been\n \nnegatively impacted by the sanctions and penalties implemented in response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For example, in\n \n2022 we recognized $0.2 billion of pre-tax charges primarily from impairments of receivables, inventory, contract assets, and equity method\n \ninvestments directly resulting from the sanctions relating to this conflict, predominantly related to our Power business. Due to the expansion\n \nof U.S. sanctions in 2023, we recognized an additional pre-tax charge of $0.1 billion primarily from impairments of inventory, receivables,\n \nand contract assets.\n \nWhile our remaining net asset exposure to Russia is not material, we continue to actively monitor the dynamic\n \nsituation in Ukraine and applicable laws, sanctions, and trade control restrictions resulting from the conflict. The extent to which our\n \noperations and financial results may be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will depend on various factors, including the extent and\n \nduration of the conflict; the effects of the conflict on regional and global economic and geopolitical conditions; the effects of further laws,\n \nsanctions, and trade control restrictions on our business, the global economy, and global supply chains; and the impact of fluctuations in\n \nthe exchange rate of the ruble. Continuation or escalation of the conflict may also magnify the impact of other risks identified in this\n \nInformation Statement, including cybersecurity, regulatory, and reputational risks\nRisks Relating to Competition and Managing Growth\nWe operate in highly competitive environments. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of \noperations, cash flows, and financial condition. \nOur products, solutions, and services are subject to significant competitive pressures, \nand in many of the industries in which we operate we face intense competition from both international and domestic competitors. The \ncontinual development of advanced technologies, new and existing products and solutions including product enhancements, and high \n2024 FORM 10-K \n17\nquality but cost-effective supply chain, production, and delivery methods are critical to remaining competitive by maintaining commercially \nattractive products, solutions, and services at acceptable pricing levels. A change in the strategic priorities of our business or a failure to \nanticipate or respond quickly to a number of factors including technological developments, evolving industry standards, new regulations or \nincentives, changing customer demands, supply chain issues, or innovations in production techniques in the industries we serve could \ncause us to experience lower revenues, price erosion, lower margins, and could result in forgone growth opportunities. Competition has \nalso intensified as a result of international expansion by existing industry participants exploiting new markets and increasing pressure from \ncompetitors from other regions who strive to improve the quality and reliability of their technologies and expand beyond their existing \nmarkets. For example, China is a large manufacturer and developer of wind equipment and technology and Chinese wind turbine \nmanufacturers may increasingly pursue selling their wind turbine products in markets outside of China. The entry of new market \nparticipants could further intensify competition. \nMoreover, some of our competitors receive financial and other assistance from their \ngovernments, which may allow them to have a longer-term investment approach and greater risk tolerance to realizing returns and other \nbenefits from their investments and business strategies and execution than may be available to companies, such as us, that do not have \nsimilar governmental funding and assistance. \nIf we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures, our business, results \nof operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy may include acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, partnerships, or divestitures to support our growth \nand financial performance, and our failure to successfully execute these transactions could adversely affect our business. \nOur \nbusiness strategy may include the acquisition, in part or in whole, of technologies and businesses that expand or complement our existing \nbusinesses. Successful growth through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets or assets, conduct due \ndiligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate the acquired target or asset \nsuccessfully. Certain transactions may be subject, in certain circumstances, to the consent of \nGE\n under the Tax Matters Agreement, as \ndiscussed in “—Risks Relating to the Spin-Off.”\nTransactions may expose us to significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n•\ncompetition for targets and assets, which may lead to substantial increases in purchase price or terms that are less attractive to \nus;\n•\nfailure to timely integrate or separate acquired or divested companies’ assets, people, and products;\n•\nfailure to comply with laws and regulations, including any required disclosures and filings, in one or multiple jurisdictions in relation \nto a transaction;\n•\nexpenses, delays, and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing businesses;\n•\ndiversion of our management’s attention from existing operations to the \nacquisition\n and integration process, as applicable;\n•\ndependence on external sources of capital, in particular to finance the purchase price of Transactions;\n•\nrulings by antitrust or other regulatory bodies;\n•\nacquired companies’ previous failures to comply with applicable legal, regulatory or other governmental requirements;\n•\ninability to produce products at increased scale or loss of previously available distribution channels;\n•\nheightened external scrutiny on acquired IP rights, or lack of IP rights for the acquired portfolio; \n•\na failure to accurately predict or to realize expected growth opportunities, cost savings, synergies, and market acceptance of \nacquired companies’ products;\n•\na failure to identify or appropriately assess material issues, problems or liabilities during due diligence review of acquisition targets \n(or its agents) prior to acquisition;\n•\nsuccessor liability imposed by regulators for actions by the target (or its agents) prior to acquisition;\n•\ncontinued losses and exposures for liabilities not transferred to a buyer or otherwise divested in a divestiture;\n•\ndifficulties in retaining key customers and personnel; and\n•\nadverse market reactions to a transaction.\nVarious other assessments and assumptions regarding a transaction may prove to be incorrect, and actual developments may differ \nsignificantly from our expectations.\nIn addition, we also regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including equity method investments, joint ventures and \nother strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives. We may not successfully identify, assess, or manage the risks \npresented by these strategic transactions, including those outlined above. Equity investments and other strategic alliances pose additional \nrisks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more \nother parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies, or \nresources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own.\nOur business strategy may also include the divestiture of certain assets or operating units in order to enable the redeployment of capital. \nWe may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or face other limitations such as regulatory, governmental, or contractual requirements that \ncould delay or prevent the accomplishment of our objectives and adversely affect our business. These limitations include the provisions of \nthe Separation and Distribution Agreement described under “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE\n—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit Support” in the Information Statement.\nThe occurrence of any of the above in connection with any\n transaction c\nould have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash \nflows, financial condition, or prospects.\nThere are risks associated with our joint venture arrangements, consortiums, and similar collaborations with third parties for \ncertain projects, which could impose additional costs and obligations on us. \nWe have entered and expect to continue to enter into \njoint venture arrangements for manufacturing and commercial operations and/or project development and funding. We also enter into \nagreements with third parties to act as a consortium to perform projects.\nOur joint venture arrangements may expose us to risks, including risks with respect to the economic, political, and regulatory environment \nof any foreign entities with which we partner, legal and regulatory violations committed by partners whose actions are outside of our control, \n2024 FORM 10-K \n18\nand risks associated with contractual, governmental or certain exclusivity obligations with partners that may impose operational restrictions \non us. Furthermore, these arrangements may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase expenditures, or disrupt our \nordinary business activities. If joint venture, consortium, or other strategic partners cannot meet their obligations due to financial or other \ndifficulties, including if they declare bankruptcy or otherwise modify their capital structure, we could be required to provide additional \ninvestment or services or take responsibility for breaches of contracts or assume additional financial or operational obligations which could \nhave a substantial adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe currently have equity interests in multiple joint ventures and expect to enter into additional joint venture arrangements in the future. Our \ninfluence over these entities varies depending on the level and nature of ownership and/or rights agreed, and for some of these entities our \ninfluence may be limited. Even in joint ventures where we have greatest influence, we are usually required to reach consensus with our \njoint venture partners in connection with major decisions concerning the operations of the joint ventures. This could create the risk of \nimpasses on decisions, given that our partners in these arrangements may have economic or business interests that diverge from our \ninterests. Additionally, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or disputes. Conflicts may \narise in these arrangements concerning the achievement of performance milestones or the interpretation of significant terms under any \nagreement (including financial obligations), termination rights, or the ownership or control of IP developed during the arrangement. We also \ncannot control the actions of our joint venture partners. We sometimes have joint and several liabilities with our joint venture partners under \nthe applicable contracts for joint venture projects and we cannot be certain that our partners will be able to satisfy any potential liability that \ncould arise. These factors could potentially harm the business and operations of a joint venture and, in turn, our business and operations. \nIn addition, our arrangements involving joint ventures may restrict us from gaining access to the cash flows or assets of these entities. In \nsome cases, our joint ventures have governmentally imposed restrictions on their abilities to transfer funds to us.\nIn addition, success on consortium projects depends in part on whether our consortium partners fulfill their contractual obligations. Such \nprojects are subject to the risk that our consortium partners may block or delay decisions which could be integral to the success of the \nproject or investments in the project, or could implement strategies that are contrary to our economic interests, resulting in a lower return \nthan expected. If any of these third parties fails to perform its contractual obligations satisfactorily, we may be required to provide or procure \nadded services to compensate for such failure. Such third-party failures may also expose us to reputational harm as well as complaints \nfrom customers and other counterparties. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, \nfinancial condition, or prospects.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new technologies. \nIn many of the industries in which \nwe operate, technologies change rapidly, and customer needs evolve regularly. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to \ninnovate by developing and commercializing new products, solutions, and services. The commercial success of new technologies, such as \nhydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, small modular or other advanced nuclear power and \ngrid-scale batteries or other storage solutions, depends on many factors, including the pace of innovation, the development costs and the \navailability of capital resources to fund those costs, the levels of competition from others developing similar or other competing \ntechnologies, our ability to obtain or maintain government permits or certifications, the effectiveness of our production, distribution, and \nmarketing efforts, the availability of raw materials and components, and the costs to customers to deploy and provide support for the new \ntechnologies. Also, overall market demand, growth, and acceptance of our new innovations remain key to their success, as well as the \ntiming of when we bring these offerings to market. If and to the extent these predictions are proved wrong, our investments in new \nproducts, solutions, and services may not achieve revenue or profits at all or the recovery of investments may be over an extended period. \nUnsuccessful efforts to develop and adapt our products, solutions, and services could ultimately result in lower revenue, lower margins, \nand/or higher costs, which could harm our competitive position and adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe face a complex global operating environment, particularly in emerging markets. \nDue to our global nature, we deal with a range of \nlegal and regulatory systems with varying requirements. Due to the nature of our projects and products, we face risks associated with \nengagements with foreign officials and government agencies, including the risks of complying with diverse procedures and standards \nimposed by (among others) the FCPA and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. We also face risks associated \nwith compliance with global privacy and data security laws and regulations. Navigating a variety of legal and regulatory regimes may \nincrease the difficulty of compliance, particularly as such laws change or are interpreted in unexpected ways. In addition, as an employer of \npermanent and fixed-term contract employees and contractors, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies \nand other administrative programs that comply with the laws of multiple countries. We also must communicate, monitor, and uphold group-\nwide standards and directives across our global network, including in relation to our suppliers, subcontractors, and other relevant \nstakeholders. Our failure to manage our geographically diverse operations successfully could impair our ability to react quickly to changing \nbusiness and market conditions and to enforce compliance with group-wide standards and procedures.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulations and Legal Matters\nPolicies may alter the demand mix for our products in unfavorable ways. Any reductions or the elimination of governmental \nincentives or policies that support renewable energy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, \ncash flows, financial condition, and prospects. \nParts of our business benefit significantly from government policies that support utility \nscale renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of such projects in regions in which we operate or plan to develop and \noperate renewable energy facilities. In a number of economic regions and countries, notably in the U.S., EU, Japan, and South Korea, the \nfederal governments and some state and other local governments provide incentives, such as tax incentives, renewable portfolio \nstandards, or feed-in-tariffs, that support or are designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities, such as \nwind, hydro, and solar energy facilities and support the manufacture of products to be used in these facilities. As a result of budgetary \nconstraints, political factors or otherwise, governments from time to time may review such laws and policies and take actions that would be \nless conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities or to the manufacture of products for these facilities. Any \nreductions or the elimination of governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy, such as the imposition of additional \ntaxes or other assessments on renewable energy, could result in the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of \nnew renewable energy projects, our abandoning the development of renewable energy projects, reduced return on the manufacture of \nproducts for these facilities, or a loss of our investments in such projects or reduced project returns from such projects. Additionally, a broad \ndecline in public support or a rollback of policy support for renewable energy technologies could adversely impact our business. \n2024 FORM 10-K \n19\nIn the U.S., the IRA includes incentives for development and production of renewable energy. In particular, the IRA extends the availability \nof investment tax credits (ITCs) and production tax credits (PTCs) to certain renewable energy projects and provides a credit for the \nmanufacture of qualifying products. We and our tax equity partners benefit from ITCs and PTCs with respect to qualifying renewable energy \nprojects. In structuring tax equity partnerships and determining ITC and PTC eligibility, we have relied upon applicable tax law and \npublished In\nternal Revenue Service (IRS) guidanc\ne. However, the application of law and guidance regarding ITC and PTC eligibility to the \nfacts of particular renewable energy projects is subject to a number of uncertainties. The IRS, Department of Treasury, and Congress may \nmodify existing guidance with respect to the application of the IRA, possibly with retroactive effect. We may face uncertainties as a result of \nefforts to pass legislation to repeal, substantially modify, or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the IRA. Additionally, our operations \nand strategic plans may have to change if certain provisions of the IRA were to be repealed, modified, or invalidated. Furthermore, there \ncan be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our approach in the event of an audit. Any of the foregoing items could reduce the amount \nof ITCs or PTCs available to us and our tax equity partners. In this event, we could be required to adjust the terms of future tax equity \npartnerships or seek alternative sources of funding for renewable energy projects, each of which could have a material adverse effect on \nour business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, and prospects. We expect to claim credits associated with the \nmanufacture of qualified products. We rely on applicable tax law and guidance to determine the amount of these credits. However, the \nDepartment of the Treasury or IRS may issue additional guidance that may reduce our eligibility for \ncredits\n or may disagree with our \ninterpretation of the applicable tax law in the event of an audit. Our business could also be adversely affected by the loss or significant \nreduction in access to U.S. government technology grants and related funding programs. Beyond incentives policies, new environmental \nregulatory actions or significant modifications to existing policies of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), such as the EPA’s \nannouncement in April 2023 of proposed new air emissions standards for natural gas operators, could increase our operating costs or \nimpede sales of our products, solutions, and services.\nIn Europe, we benefit from a number of government-sponsored programs, incentives, and initiatives related to renewable energy. In \nDecember 2020, the EU agreed to reduce net EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. In May \n2022, the EU announced the REPowerEU plan which seeks to rapidly reduce the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels by 2027. Furthermore, \nthe EU introduced the Green Deal Industrial Plan that is expected to further accelerate the expansion of renewable energy and green \ntechnologies including easing state aid rules to enable higher subsidies. A key component of the Green Deal Industrial Plan is the Net Zero \nIndustry Act to simplify regulations, speed up permits and promote cross-border projects to accelerate climate neutrality. There can be no \nassurance that these EU regulations will remain in effect in their present form or at all, and the elimination, reduction, or modification of \nthese regulations could materially harm our renewable energy programs.\nInternational, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are \nfocused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Caps or fees on carbon emissions have been and may continue to be established and the \ncost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossil- fuel sectors. While such legislation and regulations could boost demand \nfor our technologies that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, such as hydrogen and carbon capture technologies, \ncompliance with greenhouse gas emission legislation and regulations applicable to our or our customers’ operations may have significant \nimplications that could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFailure to meet ESG (including sustainability) expectations or standards or achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. \nThere has been an increased focus from regulators and \nstakeholders on \nESG \nmatters. These include areas such as greenhouse\n gas emissions and climate-related risks that are particularly \nrelevant for the industries we serve and our businesses, as well as inclusive employment practices and equal employment opportunities\n, \nresponsible sourcing, human rights and social responsibility, and corporate governance. We have established sustainability goals aligned \nwith certain ESG goals and targets. Our ability to accomplish them presents numerous operational, regulatory, financial, legal, and other \nchallenges, several of which are outside of our control.\nIncreasing focus on ESG factors has led to enhanced interest in the review of performance results by investors and other stakeholders and \nthe potential for litigation and reputational risk. Some investors have used, and may continue to use, ESG criteria to guide their investment \nstrategies, and may not invest in us, or divest their holdings of us, if they believe our policies relating to ESG matters are inadequate. Our \nvoluntary disclosures of ESG data under standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board \n(\nSASB\n), and recommendations issued by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\nTCFD\n) are \nevaluated and rated by various organizations that assess corporate ESG performance. Unfavorable ESG ratings, or our inability to meet \nthe ESG standards set by specific investors, may lead to unfavorable sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact, among \nother things, on our stock price and cost of capital. Regulatory requirements related to ESG or sustainability reporting have been adopted in \nthe EU that apply or will apply to us when effective, due to our revenues and employee populations in the EU, including the EU \nCSRD\n, EU \nTaxonomy, and the EU \nCSDDD\n. \nIn the U.S., such regulations have been issued requiring carbon emissions and climate risk disclosures in \nCalifornia, related to pension investments in California, and for the responsible investment of public funds in Illinois.\n Additional regulation is \npending at the SEC, at the federal level for government contractors, and in other states. Globally, we anticipate an increase in carbon \nemissions and climate risk disclosure requirements under the International Sustainability Standards Board framework, such as the recently \nadopted Australian climate-related financial disclosures legislation. We expect regulatory requirements related to ESG matters to continue \nto expand globally, particularly in the EU. We may be affected by our ability to meet evolving and expanding emissions reporting \nrequirements and by investor and public perception of our reporting and performance related to voluntary climate standards. Given the \nincreasing scrutiny on ESG matters as well as the increasing number of regulatory obligations relating to our business, there is also an \nincreasing risk that we could be perceived as or accused of making inaccurate or misleading statements regarding our performance against \nESG-related measures and/or ESG initiatives.\nFailure to achieve our ESG goals, commitments and targets or comply with emerging ESG regulations could adversely affect our business, \nresults of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Changes in ESG regulations could lead to additional operational restrictions and \ncompliance requirements upon us or our products, require new or additional investment in product designs, result in carbon offset \ninvestments or otherwise could negatively impact our business and/or competitive position. Any such failure could harm our reputation, \nadversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and talent and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community \nand enforcement authorities.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n20\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position. \nChanges in government policies on \nforeign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products solutions, and services, impact our competitive position, subject us to \nescalating costs, or prevent us from being able to offer our products, solutions, and services in certain countries. The implementation of \nmore restrictive trade policies, such as import or export controls, required licenses or authorizations to engage in business dealings with \ncertain countries or entities, higher tariffs, restrictions on outbound investment, more detailed inspections, exchange controls, a \ngovernment’s adoption of “buy national” policies, local production requirements, or other barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large \nquantities of products, solutions, and services could be disruptive and costly to our business and could negatively impact our business, \nresults of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and prospects. \nFailure to obtain or comply with federal, state and local government approvals, licenses, and permits may negatively affect our \nability to produce, market, and sell our products, solutions, and services. \nParts of our business are required to obtain, and to comply \nwith, federal, state, and local government approvals, licenses, and permits. Any of these approvals, licenses, or permits may be subject to \ndenial, revocation, or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of approvals, licenses, or \npermits may adversely affect our operations by suspending our activities or curtailing our work and may subject us to penalties and other \nsanctions. For example, our nuclear operations in the U.S. are subject to regulation by the NRC. Failure to obtain approval or renewal of \nour NRC licenses could result in significant disruptions to our nuclear business. Obtaining licenses and permits can be subject to extended \ntime delays due to governmental requirements and policies as well as local official processes and availability.\nAlthough existing licenses are routinely renewed by various regulators, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including \nthe failure to comply with EHS laws and regulations, the failure to comply with permit conditions, violations found during inspections or \notherwise, or local community, political, or other opposition.\nIn addition, concerns about climate change and increased environmental activism could slowdown regulatory approval of fossil fuel-based \npower generation activities that could negatively impact the related products, solutions, and services we provide to customers. If new \nlegislation or regulations are enacted or implemented, or if existing laws or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced \ndifferently, we may be required to obtain additional operating approvals, licenses, or permits. Moreover, changes in industry standards and \ngovernmental regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs to adapt our products, solutions, and services. Our inability to obtain, and \nto comply with, the approvals, licenses, or permits required for our business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, our \ncustomers are often required to obtain, and comply with, approvals, licenses, or permits required for their businesses, and their failure to \nobtain, or comply with, those approvals, licenses, or permits\n may n\negatively impact our ability to provide products and services to them and \nto execute our projects.\nThe physical effects of climate change, including weather disruptions and related effects, could adversely impact our business.\nThe physical effects of climate change can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency and severity of \nsignificant weather events (e.g., flooding, hurricanes, and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean \ntemperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g., drought, desertification, or poor water quality). Climate \nchange may also produce general changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and \nthus may impact consumer demand for electricity generation. Such effects have the potential to affect business continuity and operating \nresults, and could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers, including through direct damage to physical assets and \nindirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. These effects may negatively impact our business, results of operations, \ncash flows, and prospects.\nOur operations are subject to various EHS laws and regulations, and potential litigation, and non-compliance with or liabilities \nunder such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, fines, sanctions, claims, additional regulatory oversight, \nsuspension of operations, and reputational harm. \nWe are subject to extensive domestic and international EHS regulations. In addition \nto EHS regulatory compliance obligations, we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal \ninjury, property damage, and human health risks due to exposure to hazardous substances, processes, or working conditions at our current \nor former facilities. We may also face liability in connection with the actions or omissions of third-party contractors working at our project \nsites or facilities. Any perceived or actual employee safety issues could result in substantial costs to us that may exceed our reserves, harm \nour reputation, divert management’s attention, and could potentially affect our ability to continue operating in certain jurisdictions. \nIn addition, we may become subject to increased regulatory oversight and suspensions of our operations for events that may occur at our \nprojects. For example, we experienced a blade event during 2024 at our Vineyard Wind project, which, among other things, resulted in our \nhaving to suspend operations at that project for an extended period and being subject to additional regulatory oversight at that project. See \nItem 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Offshore Wind\" for further information.\nWe may be impacted by material changes in EHS regulations or subject to substantial liability for environmental impacts, both of which may \nrequire increased capital expenditures. We may also be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly \nas greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change regulations and initiatives increase and EHS laws and regulations grow in number and \ncomplexity. Such laws and regulations may impose additional liability on industrial manufacturers for the use or generation of chemicals, \nsuch as per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), contained in components and products sourced in connection with manufacturing and \nservices operations, and if adopted, may create additional liability, impact product design, manufacturing, and/or servicing and negatively \naffect financial results. Environmental laws also generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials \nand other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of \nlegally at the time in question. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several or strict liability for remediation of releases of \nhazardous substances, which could result in us incurring a liability for environmental damage without regard to our negligence or fault. \nSuch laws and regulations could expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for our acts \nwhich were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n21\nOur nuclear operations expose us to various additional environmental, regulatory, and financial risks, including:\n•\npotential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the \nstorage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;\n•\nunplanned expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, defects, upgrades and repairs required by the NRC and \nother government agencies;\n•\nlimitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with \nnuclear operations; and\n•\npotential liabilities arising out of a nuclear, radiological or criticality incident, whether or not it is within our control.\nOur nuclear operations are subject to various safety-related requirements imposed by the U.S. Government, the Department of Energy, and \nthe NRC. In the event of non-compliance, these agencies might increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down our operations, \ndepending upon the assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by these agencies \ncould necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures. In addition, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations \nrelating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how \nwe do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and \nregulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts.\nWe may be subject to periodic claims, litigation, regulatory proceedings, and enforcement actions, which may adversely affect \nour business and financial performance. \nFrom time to time, we are involved in claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, investigations, \nand enforcement actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. Our business is subject to the risk of claims \ninvolving current and former employees, affiliates, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, government regulatory agencies or \nothers through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, investigations, or other \nproceedings. Additionally, we have had, and expect in the future to have, customers who assert contractual or other claims related to the \nperformance or design of our products, timeliness of delivery or other aspects of our commercial relationships. Given the nature of our \nbusiness, which often involves large projects and long-term commercial relationships, such claims, whether asserted in commercial \ndiscussions, litigation or other types of proceedings, can be for significant amounts.\nGlobal enforcement of anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA, has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary \nself-disclosure by companies, aggressive investigations (including coordinated investigations across countries and governmental \nauthorities) and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant civil and criminal \nfines, penalties, and other sanctions against companies and individuals. We may face liability under anti-corruption laws based upon \nactions or inactions even when they are not subject to our control. Our global activities can also subject us to legacy legal proceedings and \nlegal compliance risks that relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or improper payments of certain companies we acquire during the \npre-acquisition periods. Such investigations or government scrutiny may also impact our ability to participate in various governmental \nfinancing programs and could limit our access to project financing from multilateral development banks and the World Bank.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties associated with the resolution of claims, litigation, regulatory proceedings, investigations, and \nenforcement actions, it is often difficult to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of such \nclaims, actions, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, is often difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs or regulatory agencies may \nseek injunctive relief or recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for \nsubstantial periods of time or until the time of a final judgment, award, order or settlement. Given that our business involves large scale \ninfrastructure projects and products and service contracts with a long duration, we are involved in commercial litigation or disputes from \ntime to time where the initial amounts claimed by counterparties have been and may be large, even if ultimately our liability or settlement \namounts to resolve such claims is significantly lower. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil \npenalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.\nActivist stockholders advocating for certain governance or strategic changes may also bring actions against us. These proceedings or \nactions could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves and distract our \nmanagement from the operation of our business. \nWhile we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and \nis subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. We may therefore incur significant expenses defending any such \nsuit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely affect our \nresults of operations, and cash flows, and financial condition. For further information on material pending legal proceedings, see Note \n22\n in \nthe Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.\nWe are subject to antitrust and competition laws that can result in sanctions and conditions on the way we conduct our business.\nWe are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which generally prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, including \nprice fixing, bid rigging, cartel activities, price discrimination, market monopolization, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors, \nallocation schemes, and other practices that have, may have, or are perceived to have an adverse effect on competition. Regulatory \nauthorities may have authority to impose fines and sanctions or to require changes or impose conditions on the way we conduct business \nin connection with alleged non-compliance with applicable law. Under certain circumstances, violations of antitrust laws could result in \nsuspension or debarment of our ability to contract with certain parties or complete certain transactions. In addition, an increasing number of \njurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to seek damages asserting claims of anti-competitive \nconduct. Increased government scrutiny of our actions or enforcement or private rights of action could adversely affect our business or \ndamage our reputation. In addition, as previously reported by GE, the power and grid businesses that GE acquired from Alstom in 2015 \nwere the subject of significant cases involving alleged anti-competitive conduct or improper payments by Alstom in the pre-acquisition \nperiod. A number of these matters remain ongoing as we seek to resolve them, and it is possible that additional claims from legacy Alstom \nconduct could arise in the future. Conducting internal investigations or responding to audits or investigations by government agencies could \nbe costly and time-consuming. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or criminal or other \npenalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n22\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, public procurement, and government reimbursements \nin many jurisdictions, and the failure to comply could adversely affect our business. \nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our \nofferings to government entities around the world. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations in a variety of jurisdictions \nthat apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts can differ from the laws governing \nprivate contracts and government contracts may contain terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts or that expose us \nto higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. Similarly, most jurisdictions have public procurement laws and \nreimbursement policies that set out rules and regulations for purchases and reimbursements by governmental entities. Certain countries \nimpose additional requirements on government suppliers as a prerequisite to doing business in the country including, among other things, \nlocal headcount requirements, local manufacturing and supplier requirements, and technology or IP transfers. These jurisdictions may \nmodify their laws, policies, rules, or regulations, or impose new requirements that could adversely affect our business.\nFor contracts with the U.S. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and \napplicable agency rules, the Procurement Integrity Act, the Buy American Act, and/ or the Trade Agreements Act. Some governmental \nentities, including the U.S. federal government, can terminate contracts for their convenience or for our default. These governmental \nentities may also be subject to continued legislative funding approval. Early termination for convenience of one or more of our contracts, or \na change in a government customer’s funding levels, could impact our expected revenues. A termination for default of one or more of our \ncontracts could subject us to penalties and damages resulting from the default, including costs for the governmental entity to reprocure the \nitems under contract, in addition to other penalties previously listed. In addition, the U.S. federal government could invoke the Defense \nProduction Act, requiring that we accept and prioritize contracts for materials deemed necessary for national defense, regardless of loss in \nrevenue incurred on such contracts. In such circumstances, we may be required to reallocate time and resources away from our customers \nto fulfill U.S. federal government requests under the Defense Production Act. This could cause us to be unable to fulfill contractual \nobligations to non-U.S. federal government customers and harm long-term business relationships with our customers, suppliers, and \nchannel partners, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to government audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings with respect to regulations governing government \ncontracts, public procurement, and government reimbursements. Efforts to ensure our business arrangements comply with applicable laws \ninvolve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not \ncomply with current or future laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, defense can be costly, time-consuming, \nand may require significant financial and personnel resources. If we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those \nactions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, \ndisgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in certain government programs, contractual \ndamages, reputational harm, delayed or reduced payments, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our \noperations. In addition, any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government \ncontract work or participation in projects involving multilateral development banks. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect \non our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. \nOur failure to comply with financial services regulatory obligations could damage our reputation, result in regulatory action \nagainst us and adversely affect our business. \nCertain of our affiliates are or intend to become a broker-dealer or a registered investment \nadviser, as applicable, and will provide fee-based services in respect of the arranging and syndication of securities, transaction advisory \nand structuring, and investment management inclusive of tax equity investments. For the first two years of GE Vernova’s existence, these \nservices will be provided to GE on a cost-basis. In the future, such services may be provided to third parties on an arms-length basis. For \nmore information, see “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE—Framework Investment \nAgreement\n” \nin the Information Statement. While we believe these kinds of transactions are beneficial to our business, the functions that these affiliates \nwill perform may give rise to conflicts of interest, because these transactions will typically involve investments in large energy infrastructure \nprojects to which GE Vernova’s businesses will sell equipment and services. Such conflicts of interest, whether actual or perceived, may \nresult in potential litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Broker-dealers are registered with the SEC and are members of self-\nregulatory organizations such as FINRA. As such, they are subject to the regulations established under the Exchange Act and FINRA rules. \nRegistered investment advisers are registered with the SEC and are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act. The \nregulations to which broker-dealers and registered investment advisers are subject are extensive and evolving over time, and the level of \nfinancial regulation has generally increased in recent years. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Advisers Act, Exchange \nAct or FINRA rules, including recordkeeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent \nactivities, could result in examinations, investigations, sanctions, and reputational damage, and could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 1. \"Business—Regulation—Manufacturer and Servicer—Financial \nServices\" for further information. \nRisks Relating to Employee Matters\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively \nand our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. \nOur operations and future success depend on our ability to \nrecruit, develop, and retain highly qualified personnel, particularly our senior management team, key employees and technical personnel, \nand on our efficient utilization of our workforce. Our team members are the key resource to developing, manufacturing, and delivering our \nproducts and providing technical services to our customers around the world. Some of our project sites involve placing team members in \ngeographically remote or high-risk locations, and we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial costs to satisfy employee safety \ncriteria and retain highly skilled personnel. For example, the installation, operation, and maintenance of offshore wind turbines is difficult, \nlabor intensive, and costly, and requires the availability of a highly skilled labor force. Notwithstanding our safety precautions and \ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, we have experienced safety incidents that resulted in serious injury and death, involving \nour employees and contractors, and we may be unable to avoid similar incidents in the future. Any safety concerns or incidents, regardless \nof fault, could adversely affect our ability to attract additional qualified employees or contractors. Factors that may affect our ability to attract \nand retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees and contractors include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other \nemployers, our ability to manage attrition, and availability of qualified individuals. Difficulties in hiring or retaining highly qualified personnel, \nthe failure to properly manage succession plans, or the unexpected loss of experienced employees resulting in the depletion of our \ninstitutional knowledge base as well as difficulties in efficient utilization of our workforce could have an adverse impact on our business \n2024 FORM 10-K \n23\nperformance, reputation, results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition. Failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of \npersonnel with the necessary skill set and experience, or the loss of key employees, could impede our ability to deliver our growth \nobjectives and execute our strategy.\nWe have significant net liabilities with respect to our postretirement benefit plans, including pension, healthcare, and life \ninsurance benefits obligations, and the actual costs of these obligations could exceed current estimates and asset returns could \nbe less than current estimates. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our total postretirement benefit plans’ net liabilities for our employees, our \nformer employees, and certain legacy former employees unrelated to our core business and allocated to us by GE was approximately $1.7 \nbillion. \nThese net liabilities arise under multiple benefit plans and statutory obligations in various countries. Increases in pension, \nhealthcare, and life insurance benefits obligations and costs and decreases in rate of return of associated assets can adversely affect our \nearnings, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to \ncurrent and future retirees and there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to control increases in these costs will succeed \nand this could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, and financial condition. Most of the liabilities arise under \npension plans, including defined benefit pension plans,\n and include plans that are fully funded, partly funded, or unfunded.\nOur results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit \npension plans. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\nGAAP)\n requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using \nactuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates, discount rate, and the expected long-term rate of \nreturn on plan assets. We are also required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant \nreduction or increase in equity. The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to changes in key economic indicators, and \nfuture decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial \nresults. In addition, although U.S. GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that \naffect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans under the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\nERISA)\n. Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors, \nincluding sustained market volatility, could also result in an increase in the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension \nplans.\nThe defined benefit obligation is determined by actuarial assumptions such as the rate of compensation increase or pension progression \nrate and biometric factors (such as participant mortality), as well as the discount rate applied. The basis for determining the discount rate is \nin principle the yield on high-quality corporate bonds. A change of the discount rate and changes of the assessments of market yields used \nmay result in significant changes to the defined benefit obligation. Differences between actual experience and the predicted actuarial \nassumptions, discount rates, and investment performance on plan assets can affect defined benefit plan liabilities.\nWe assumed certain liabilities from GE in connection with the Spin-Off, including some liabilities unrelated to our core business. For \nexample, we retained and assumed responsibility for certain liabilities for pension, healthcare, and life insurance benefits previously \nprovided to GE employees, including our employees, our former employees, and certain other legacy former employees unrelated to our \ncore business and allocated to us by GE. \nWe currently partially rely on estimates and assumptions made by GE with respect to the scope, \nprobability, and magnitude of these liabilities. \nSuch estimates and assumptions involve complex judgments which are difficult to make. \nActual developments may differ from estimates and assumptions, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in our actual obligations for \nthese liabilities. Changes in economic conditions, financial markets, investment performance, or legal conditions governing these liabilities \ncan result in significant increases or decreases in the size of our actual obligations over time. Any of these factors and developments could \nhave a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Furthermore, accounting standards \nand legal conditions governing our pension obligations are subject to changes in applicable legislation, regulations, or case law. We cannot \nprovide any assurance that we will not incur new or more extensive pension obligations in the future due to such changes.\nAny of these factors and developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or \nprospects. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit \nobligation, see Note \n13\n in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.\nDisruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could harm our business. \nA significant number of our employees \naround the world are members of, or represented by, labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements with varying \ndurations and expiration dates. Many of our European employees belong to, or are represented by, works councils. Union and works \ncouncil requirements may limit our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes. In addition, employees who are not \ncurrently members of, or otherwise represented by, labor organizations may seek such membership or representation, as applicable, in the \nfuture.\nWe cannot ensure that existing collective bargaining agreements will prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future, that we \nwill be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the \ncost of labor, including healthcare, pensions, or other benefits, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of \nour operations, including by way of strikes or work stoppages. In addition, negotiations with labor unions, possible work stoppages and \nother labor problems could divert management attention, which could further harm our business. Furthermore, some of our customers and \nsuppliers have unionized work forces. We may experience an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and \ncompetitive position if we are subject, directly or indirectly, to labor actions by our or our suppliers’ or customers’ employees, or as a result \nof general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements.\nOur reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or \nbusiness partners. \nMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by any of our \nemployees, agents, or business partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could \ninclude payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, \nmoney laundering, data privacy, and lobbying and similar activities. The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the Brazil Clean Companies \nAct, China’s Unfair Competition Law, India’s Prevention of Corruption Act, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other \njurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose \n2024 FORM 10-K \n24\nof obtaining or retaining business. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. It is \npossible that the controls that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training, internal control policies, and other \nsafeguards to educate our employees and certain third parties, could be intentionally circumvented or become inadequate because of \nchanged conditions. As a result, we cannot assure that our controls will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our \nemployees or agents. Any alleged or actual violations of these laws or regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, criminal, civil, or \nadministrative sanctions, stockholder lawsuits, reputational damage, and other liabilities. In some instances, we make self-disclosures to \nrelevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us. The costs associated with the investigation, \nremediation, and potential notification of any violation to customers, regulators, and counterparties could be material. Any of the foregoing \ncould have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.\nRisks Relating to Technology and Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain, protect, or effectively enforce our IP rights. \nWe cannot assure that our means of obtaining, \nmaintaining, and enforcing our IP rights will be adequate to maintain a competitive advantage. The laws of many jurisdictions may not \nprotect our IP rights or provide an adequate forum to effectively address situations where our IP rights have been compromised. \nFurthermore, protecting against the unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive and we may need to litigate with \nthird parties to enforce or defend patents issued to us and our other IP rights or to determine the enforceability and validity of our \nproprietary rights or those of others. Determining whether an offering infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates a third party’s IP \nrights involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of this type of litigation is often uncertain and may not always be \nconsistent. An adverse determination in any such litigation could materially impair our IP rights and may have a negative impact on our \nbusiness\n.\nFrom time to time, we may receive notices from third parties alleging infringement, misappropriation, or violation of their IP rights. We are \nalso subject to lawsuits alleging infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of third-party IP rights. When such claims are asserted \nagainst us (or to avoid such claims), we may sometimes seek to license the third party’s IP rights, which may be costly. We may be unable \nto obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain an adequate license, we may be subject to lawsuits \nseeking damages or an injunction against the manufacture, import, marketing, sale, or operation of certain of our offerings or against the \noperation of part of our business as presently conducted. Any settlement payment or other compromise may have future repercussions on \nour ability to defend and protect certain of our IP rights. We do not maintain insurance for claims or litigation involving the infringement, \nmisappropriation, or other violation of IP rights. Regardless of the merits or outcome, the resolution of any IP dispute could require \nsignificant financial and management resources.\nAdverse judicial rulings or our entry into any license or settlement agreement in connection with third-party claims could affect our ability to \ncompete on certain offerings and have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Our \nagreements with our customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to \nindemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of certain third-party IP claims. We may not always be \nsuccessful in limiting our liability with respect to such obligations and could become subject to large indemnity payments or damages claims \nfrom contractual breach, which could harm our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Furthermore, protecting \nconfidential information and trade secrets can be difficult and, even if a successful enforcement action is brought, such action may not be \neffective in protecting our confidential information and trade secrets. Additionally, the increased sharing of our data with third parties as a \nresult of right to repair legislation could increase the risk of loss or damage to our confidential information and IP. If we cannot adequately \nobtain, maintain, protect, or enforce our IP rights, our competitors may be able to compete more successfully against us, which could have \na material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.\nWe may not receive protection for pending or future applications relating to IP rights owned by or licensed to us and the scope of protection \nallowed under any issued IP rights may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products, services, solutions, and any associated \ntrademarks. Products sold by our competitors may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate IP rights owned or licensed by us. Any \nissued IP rights owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, or circumvented in litigation or other \nproceedings, and these limited IP rights may not provide us with effective competitive advantages. Intellectual property rights may also be \nunavailable, limited, unenforceable, or practically unenforceable in some countries, and some governments may require us to transfer our \nIP rights to local entities to do business in their jurisdiction, either of which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market \nposition. We may also incur substantial costs to protect ourselves in litigation or other proceedings involving the validity and enforceability \nof our IP rights. If claims against us are successful, we could lose valuable IP rights. An unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could \nhave a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.\nWe do not own the GE trademark or logo, and any elimination of our rights to use specified trademarks granted to us under our \nTrademark License Agreement with GE could have an adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or \nprospects. \nWe do not own the GE trademark or logo, which we use in line with our Trademark License Agreement with GE and in \ncombination with the “Vernova” trademark that is owned by us. GE owns and controls the GE brand, and the integrity and strength of the \nGE brand will depend in large part on the efforts and businesses of GE and other licensees of the GE brand and how the brand is used, \npromoted, and protected by them, which will be largely outside of our control.\nFurthermore, there are certain circumstances under which the Trademark License Agreement may be terminated. Termination of the \nTrademark License Agreement would eliminate our rights to use the specified trademarks granted to us under this agreement and may \nresult in our having to negotiate a new or reinstated agreement with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights under the \nTrademark License Agreement, which would require us to change our corporate name and undergo significant rebranding efforts. These \nrebranding efforts may require significant resources and expenses and may affect our ability to attract and retain customers, all of which \ncould have an adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. We own the “Vernova” trademark and \nhave taken steps to protect it. We have filed trademark applications and have been issued registrations for this trademark around the world. \nWe cannot be certain that, notwithstanding the legal protections, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our IP rights in this \ntrademark. \n2024 FORM 10-K \n25\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk \nto our systems, networks, products, solutions, services, and data, as well as our reputation, which could adversely affect our \nbusiness. \nWe manufacture and sell products that rely upon software and computer systems to operate properly and process and store \nconfidential information. Our products often are connected to, and reside within, our customers’ information technology (IT) infrastructures. \nIn some jurisdictions, we are expected to design our products to include appropriate cybersecurity protections, and regulatory authorities \nreview such protections when granting marketing authorizations. The measures we take to protect our products and IT systems from \nunauthorized access may not be effective, particularly because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems \nchange frequently, increase in sophistication, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. These risks apply to our installed \nbase of products, products we currently sell, new products we will introduce in the future, and older technology that we no longer sell or \nservice but remains in use by customers.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, such \nas ransomware, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to our security. They also \npose a risk to the security of our customers', partners', suppliers', and third-party service providers' infrastructure, products, systems, and \nnetworks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data and our customers’ data, as well as associated financial risks. As \nattackers become more capable (including sophisticated state or state-affiliated actors), and as critical infrastructure increasingly becomes \ndigitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. A significant cyber-related attack, such as an attack on power grids or power plants, could \npose broader disruptions and adversely affect our business even if such an attack does not involve our products, solutions, services, or \nsystems. We have also observed an increase in third-party cyber incidents and ransomware attacks on our suppliers, service providers and \nsoftware providers, and our efforts to mitigate adverse effects on us if this trend continues may not be successful in the future. The large \nnumber of suppliers that we work with requires significant effort for the initial and ongoing verification of their implementation of effective \ncybersecurity requirements. The increasing degree of interconnectedness and shared liability between us and our partners, suppliers, and \ncustomers also poses a risk to the security of our network as well as the larger ecosystem in which we operate. There can be no assurance \nthat our various cybersecurity measures - including employee training, monitoring and testing, performing security reviews and requiring \nbusiness partners with connections to our network to appropriately secure their IT systems, and maintaining protective systems and \ncontingency plans - will be sufficient to prevent, detect, and limit the impact of cyber-related attacks, and we remain vulnerable to known or \nunknown threats. For example, we outsource certain cybersecurity functions and will continue to look for opportunities to utilize managed \nsecurity service providers. \nIn addition, we collaborate with GE Aerospace on certain cybersecurity functions and will continue to do so \nduring a transition period following our Spin-Off. These\n arrangements will increase our overall cyber risk given the degree of our \ninterconnectedness with the provider and the potential impact on our outsourced functions that could be caused by an attack on such a \nprovider.\nIn addition to existing risks from the integration of digital technologies into our business portfolio, the adoption of new technologies in the \nfuture may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity incidents and failures. An unknown vulnerability or compromise could potentially \nimpact the security of our software or connected products and lead to the misuse or unintended use of our products, loss of our IP, \nmisappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal information, safety risks or unavailability of products.\nWe also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal information or information in our businesses that is subject to privacy and \nsecurity laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. We have vulnerability to security incidents, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, \nprogramming errors, employee errors or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to the \nmaterial compromise of sensitive, confidential or personal information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, \nunauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of or denial of access to information, defective products, production \ndowntimes, and operational disruptions.\nFurthermore, we rely on software, hardware, and other material components from a number of third parties to manufacture our products. If \na material cyber incident impacting a supplier were to result in its prolonged inability to manufacture and/or ship such components, this \ncould impact our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, third-party sourced software components, malicious code, or a critical \nvulnerability emerging within such software could expose our customers to increased cyber risk. If we were to experience a significant \ncybersecurity incident impacting our information systems or data, the costs associated with the investigation, remediation, and potential \nnotification of the incident to customers, regulators, and counterparties could be material. Any such impact could result in financial or \nreputational damage, as well as expose us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nFailure to comply with evolving data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal \ninformation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, may adversely impact our business and financial results. \nWe have access to \nsensitive, confidential, proprietary, or personal information (including employee information) in our businesses that is subject to a variety of \njurisdiction specific data privacy and security laws, regulations, standards, contractual obligations, or customer-imposed controls. The legal \nand regulatory environment related to data privacy, data protection, and cyber security is increasingly complex and rigorous, with new and \nconstantly evolving requirements applicable to our business. This evolution is further complicated by the adoption of new technologies, \nparticularly generative \nAI\n, which raises novel privacy and security issues. Enforcement practices vary widely in the jurisdictions in which our \nbusinesses operate and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nAs a result of our worldwide operations, we are subject to rapidly shifting privacy and data protection laws and regulations. In the U.S., \nvarious federal and state regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws, \nregulations, and standards concerning personal information, privacy, and data security. There are also U.S. state privacy laws that impose \nprivacy and security obligations on companies that collect and process personal information. These state laws, and similar state or federal \nlaws or regulations that may be enacted in the future, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and thus incur \nsubstantial compliance-related expenses or otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate have adopted unique data privacy and cybersecurity legal frameworks with which we must comply. Violations of \napplicable data privacy or data protection laws or regulations could result in substantial fines, regulatory investigations, reputational \ndamage, orders to cease processing or to change uses of data, sanctions, and enforcement notices, and raise the potential for civil claims \nand proceedings, including class action litigation.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n26\nInternational, federal, and state laws, regulations, and standards can differ significantly from one another and may be interpreted and \napplied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for there to be a period of uncertainty over how to \npractically apply the law, such as when there is a delay in regulators issuing supplementary guidance or implementing regulations to \nprovide clarity on their expectations. We are also observing an increase in jurisdictional specific requirements related to the cross-border \ntransfer of personal information, which can bring complexity to processing operations that are supported by external third parties located \nglobally. Given our global footprint, this complexity may significantly complicate our compliance efforts and impose considerable costs, such \nas costs related to organizational changes, modification of our data processing practices and policies, implementation of additional \nprotection technologies, or consultation with third parties who have jurisdictional expertise. In addition, compliance with applicable \nrequirements may take time away from management of other issues and can divert resources from other initiatives and projects. Any failure \nor perceived failure by us to comply with applicable international, federal, or state laws, regulations, standards, contractual obligations, or \ncustomer-imposed controls relating to data privacy and security could adversely affect our business and result in damage to our reputation \nand our relationship with our customers.\nRisks Relating to Financial, Accounting, and Tax Matters\nVolatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nAs a \nresult of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other that the U.S. \nd\nollar. \nOur business is subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations, particularly with respect to the Euro and the British pound \nsterling.\nChanges in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. dollar could affect our ability to \nsell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial \ncondition, and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign \ncurrencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. As the U.S. dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact \nbusiness, revenue and income can be impacted, including revenue decreases due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Strengthening \nof the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business, could materially and adversely \naffect our ability to compete in international markets and our sales growth in future periods. In addition, we may be unable to hedge the \neffects of foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes in a cost-effective manner. For a discussion of the ways and extent to which we \nattempt to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange risk, see Note 20 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements \nand Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\" Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, and we may be restricted \nor delayed in accessing our cash held overseas. \nOur business relies on the availability of financing for our products and services. The \ncapital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility or disruptions that may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both \nborrowers and investors. Certain customers and suppliers, as well as our business, may need access to credit and trade finance lines and \nother financing instruments for certain transactions. We have a $3.0 billion committed credit facility and a $3.0 billion committed trade \nfinance facility, but there can be no assurance that these facilities will be sufficient to meet our future needs for such transactions. \nAdditionally, we may need to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations to satisfy \nour needs for example, for working capital or capital expenditure requirements. A variety of factors beyond our control could impact the \navailability or cost of capital, including domestic or international economic conditions, increases in key benchmark interest rates and/or \ncredit spreads, the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations, and the repricing of market risks and \nvolatility in capital and financial markets. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital \nmarket financing on favorable terms, or at all, and changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could \nadversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing. Additionally, a large portion of our total \nconsolidated cash will be held overseas and may not be efficiently accessible to GE Vernova to finance or to otherwise support our capital \nmarket requirements. Such factors may impact our ability, or the ability of our customers or suppliers, to obtain debt financing, guarantees, \nor hedging from financial institutions which may negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, large energy projects may require co-financing of projects through project development loans, structured debt financing or \nequity investments, including those done in collaboration with our Financial Services business. It is possible that such financing may not be \navailable, or that the cost may be higher than anticipated, negatively impacting our ability to bid for certain projects, or negatively impacting \nour earnings, cash flows, and returns. The termination of, expiration of, or exhaustion of funding capacity or commitments available to us \nunder our Framework Investment Agreement with GE, our inability to maintain sufficient balance sheet capacity to make future tax equity \ncommitments, or an inability to generate sufficient U.S. tax base to allow us to monetize tax credits, could reduce our ability to make, or \nprevent us from making at all, future such investments, which could further negatively impact our financial condition. Any of these risks \ncould have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, prospects, and the market price of our \nsecurities.\nFuture material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could adversely affect our business. \nWe \nreview our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill, and property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), for impairment at \nleast annually. All long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market \nconditions or other changes in the outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may sell assets that we \ndetermine are not critical to our strategy. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments or related charges. Certain non-cash \nimpairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction, or other factors relating to the overall business \nenvironment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities, and tax audits could impact operating \nresults. \nWe are subject to income and other taxes (including sales, excise, and value-added) in the U.S. and numerous foreign \njurisdictions. The determination of the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and liability for income and other tax liabilities \nrequires judgment and is based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the various jurisdictions where the Company \noperates. These factors, together with changes in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, changes in interpretation of tax laws, the resolution of tax \n2024 FORM 10-K \n27\nassessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits, could impact our \noperating results, including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. Potential changes to tax laws, including changes to \ntaxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, \neffective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. governments such as \nnewly adopted global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income could increase our cash tax costs and effective tax \nrate. We are unable to predict what tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our \nbusiness, but such changes could potentially result in higher tax expense and payments, along with increasing the complexity, burden, and \ncost of compliance.\nOur tax burden could increase as a result of ongoing or future tax audits. \nWe are subject to periodic tax audits by tax authorities. Tax \nauthorities may not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations. As a result, such tax authorities may assess \nadditional tax, interest, and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits and other tax disputes to determine the \nappropriateness of our tax provision and establish reserves for material, known tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax \nexposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we \nwill accurately predict the outcomes of any tax audit or other tax dispute or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a \nfinancial cost that does not exceed our related reserves. As such, the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a \nmaterial impact on our financial results.\nOur ability to use deferred tax assets may be subject to limitation. \nWe have deferred tax assets in certain countries and our ability to \nuse such assets will depend on taxable income generation in the relevant countries. Further, while the majority of these assets either do not \ncurrently have an expiration date or have an expiration date that is later than when we expect to use such assets, subsequent changes to \napplicable tax laws in these jurisdictions could impact our ability to fully benefit from the deferred tax assets.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nThe Spin-Off could result in significant tax liability to GE and its stockholders if it is determined to be a taxable transaction. \nGE \nreceived a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, the Spin-Off, qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for \nU.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In connection with the completion of the Spin-Off, GE \nreceived a written opinion from each of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Ernst & Young, LLP to the effect that the Spin-\nOff qualifies for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code.\nThe opinion of counsel and the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP did not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the \nSpin-Off. Each opinion assumed that the Spin-Off would be completed according to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement \nand relies on the facts as stated in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the other ancillary agreements, \nthe\n Information Statemen\nt and a number of other documents.\nIn addition, the opinion of counsel, the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP, and the private letter ruling relied on certain facts, assumptions, \nrepresentations, and undertakings from GE and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and \nother matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, GE and its \nstockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel, the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP, or the private letter ruling and could be \nsubject to significant tax liabilities.\nThe opinion of counsel and the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance \nthat the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP, or the \nprivate letter ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-Off or any of certain related transactions is taxable if it determines that \nany of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the \nconclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant \nchanges in the stock ownership of GE or us after the Spin-Off. If the conclusions expressed in the opinion of counsel or the opinion of Ernst \n& Young, LLP are challenged by the IRS, and if the IRS prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences of the Spin-Off (including the tax \nconsequences to GE and the U.S. Holders (as defined in the Information Statement)) could be materially less favorable.\nIf the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, each \nU.S. Holder who received our common stock in the Spin-Off would generally be treated as having received a distribution in an amount \nequal to the fair market value of our common stock received, which would generally result in: (i) a taxable dividend to the U.S. Holder to the \nextent of that U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of GE’s current or accumulated earnings and profits; (ii) a reduction in the U.S. Holder’s basis \n(but not below zero) in GE common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the stockholder’s share of GE’s earnings and profits; \nand (iii) taxable gain from the exchange of GE common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the U.S. Holder’s \nshare of GE’s earnings and profits and the U.S. Holder’s basis in its GE common stock. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax \nConsequences of the Spin-Off” in the Information Statement.\nIf the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could have an indemnification \nobligation to GE, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. \nIf, as a \nresult of any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-\nrecognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, we could be required by our Tax Matters Agreement with \nGE to indemnify GE for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Those amounts could be material. Any such indemnification obligation \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nFor example, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that resulted in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the \nownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Spin-Off, the Spin-Off \nwould generally be taxable to GE, but not to GE stockholders, under Section 355(e), unless it were established that such transactions and \nthe Spin-Off were not part of a plan or series of related transactions. If the Spin-Off were taxable to GE due to such a 50% or greater \nchange by vote or value in the ownership of our stock, GE would recognize gain equal to the excess of the fair market value on the April 2, \n2024 FORM 10-K \n28\n2024 (Distribution Date) of our common stock distributed to GE stockholders over GE’s tax basis in our common stock, and we generally \nwould be required to indemnify GE for the tax on such gain and related expenses. Those amounts could be material. Any such \nindemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. See “Certain \nRelationships and Related Person Transactions— Agreements with GE—Tax Matters Agreement\" in the Information Statement.\nWe agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition tax treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our \nstrategic and operating flexibility. \nTo preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off and related transactions, we agreed in the Tax Matters \nAgreement to covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, as \nwell as state, local and foreign tax law. These covenants include certain restrictions on our activity for a period of two years following the \nSpin-Off. Specifically, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to enter into acquisition, merger, liquidation, sale, and stock \nredemption transactions with respect to our stock or assets and we may be required to indemnify GE against any resulting tax liabilities \neven if we do not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition. Furthermore, we are subject to specific restrictions on discontinuing \nthe active conduct of our trade or business, the issuance or sale of stock or other securities (including securities convertible into our stock \nbut excluding certain compensatory arrangements), and sales of assets outside the ordinary course of business. These covenants and \nindemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may \nmaximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable. \nSee “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions— Agreements with GE—Tax Matters Agreement” in the Information \nStatement.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off. \nWe may be unable to achieve \nthe full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation and distribution, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur \nat all. We believe that, as an independent, publicly traded company, we are able to, among other things, more effectively focus on our own \ndistinct operating priorities and strategies, better address specific market dynamics and target innovation, create incentives for our \nmanagement and employees that align more closely with our business performance and the interests of our stockholders, achieve \noperational simplification and cost savings, and articulate a clear investment proposition and tailored capital allocation policy to attract a \nlong-term investor base best suited to our business needs. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to \nachieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all, for a variety of reasons, including: (i) compliance with the requirements \nof being an independent, publicly traded company require significant amounts of our management’s time and effort, which may divert \nmanagement’s attention from operating and growing our business; (ii) we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations, actions by \nactivist stockholders, and other adverse events than if we were still a part of GE; (iii) our businesses are less diversified than GE’s \nbusinesses prior to the separation; (iv) the actions required to separate GE’s and our respective businesses could disrupt our operations; \nand (v) under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that could cause the Spin-Off to fail to \nqualify as a tax-free transaction and these restrictions may limit us for a period of time from pursuing strategic transactions and equity \nissuances or engaging in other transactions that may increase the value of our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that \nwe expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition, cash \nflows, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions, and we may not be adequately \nprepared to meet the requirements of an independent, publicly traded company on a timely or cost-effective basis. \nPrior to the \nSpin-Off, we operated as part of GE, and GE provided us with various corporate functions. Following the Spin-Off, GE does not provide us \nwith assistance other than the transition and other services described under “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” in \nthe Information Statement. These services do not include every service that we received from GE in the past, and GE is only obligated to \nprovide the transition services for limited periods following completion of the Spin-Off. Following the cessation of any transition services \nagreements, we need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the services we will no longer receive from GE. Although \nwe have made progress in providing and obtaining such services, we may be unable to replace all of these services in a timely manner or \non terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from GE.\nSince the Spin-Off, we have been installing and implementing IT infrastructure to support certain of our business functions, including \naccounting and financial reporting, human resources, legal and compliance, communications, and indirect sourcing. We may incur \nsubstantially higher costs than anticipated as we continue our transition from the existing transactional and operational systems and data \ncenters we used as part of GE. If we are unable to complete our transition effectively, we may incur temporary interruptions in business \noperations. Any delay in implementing, or operational interruptions suffered while implementing, our new IT infrastructure could disrupt our \nbusiness and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, \nquarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. \nBeginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \nyear ended December 31, 2025, we will be required to conduct an\n annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal \ncontrol over financial reporting and include a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting. Under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes Oxley Act), we are also required to \nmaintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on \nmanagement, administrative, and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources. If we fail to comply with financial \nreporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act, we may be unable to conclude that our \ninternal control over financial reporting is effective. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley \nAct in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over \nfinancial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline and we could \nbe subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and \nmanagement resources.\nMoreover, we cannot be certain that these measures would ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial \nprocesses and reporting in the future. Even if we were to conclude, and our auditors were to concur, that our internal control over financial \nreporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for \nexternal purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not \n2024 FORM 10-K \n29\nprevent or detect fraud or misstatements. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for shares of our common stock, \nand could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nWe have limited operating history as an independent, publicly traded company, and our historical combined financial information \nis not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not \nbe a reliable indicator of our future results. \nWe derived the historical combined financial information for 2022 and 2023 included in this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K from GE’s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of \noperations, cash flows, and financial position we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods \npresented, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n•\nPrior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of GE, and GE performed various corporate functions for us. Our historical combined \nfinancial information for 2022 and 2023 reflects allocations of corporate expenses from GE for these functions. These allocations \nmay not reflect the costs we have incurred or will incur for similar services as an independent, publicly traded company.\n•\nThe agreements and transactions we entered into with GE in connection with the Spin-Off, such as GE’s provision of transition \nand other services and indemnification obligations, have caused and will continue to cause us to incur new costs. See “Certain \nRelationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE” in the Information Statement.\n•\nOur historical combined financial information for 2022 and 2023 does not reflect changes that we have experienced and that we \nexpect to continue to experience as a result of our separation from GE, including changes in the financing, cash management, \noperations, cost structure, and personnel needs of our business. As part of GE, we enjoyed certain benefits from GE’s operating \ndiversity, reputation, size, purchasing power, ability to borrow, and available capital for investments; following the Spin-Off, we no \nlonger have those benefits.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs and demands on management’s time associated with \nbeing an independent, publicly traded company, including costs and demands related to corporate governance, investor and public \nrelations, and public financial reporting. Our success depends on our ability to continue to integrate our businesses that operate in various \naspects of the power industry, which historically operated separately into one cohesive company. In addition, we depend on the successful \ncooperation of our leadership team, who have limited experience leading our business. For additional information about our past financial \nperformance and the basis of presentation of our combined financial statements, \nsee “\nUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined \nFinancial Statements\" in the Information Statement and the \n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nOperations,” and our combined and consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Information Statement and in \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain of our directors and employees may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their financial interests in, or \nbecause of their previous or continuing positions with, GE or other entities with which we have commercial arrangements. \nBecause of their current or former positions with GE, certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in both us and GE. \nContinuing ownership of GE shares and equity awards could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and GE face \ndecisions that could have implications for both us and GE. Our \nBoard \nchair\n currently also serves on the board of directors of GE. Potential \nconflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and GE regarding the terms of the agreements \ngoverning the separation and distribution and our relationship with GE following the separation and distribution. See “Certain Relationships \nand Related Person Transactions” in the Information Statement for information about some of these agreements. Potential conflicts of \ninterest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or GE may enter into in the future. In addition, some of our \nindependent directors serve on boards or management of companies with which we have commercial relationships, including investors. \nSimilar potential conflicts of interest could arise as a result. A dispute regarding a potential or actual conflict of interest involving us and GE \nor any of such other companies could negatively impact our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In \naddition, public perception of such an actual or apparent conflict of interest could pose reputational risks and expose us to increased \nscrutiny from investors and regulators. Although we have policies governing conflicts of interest, they may not sufficiently protect against \nthese risks.\nOur written code of conduct applies to our directors and executive officers, as well as employees, and intends to promote honest and \nethical conduct, including the handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interests between personal and professional relationships. Our \ngovernance principles assist with governance practices, including a requirement that directors disclose actual or potential conflicts of \ninterest and recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal, business, or professional interests. The \ngovernance principles also delegate the resolution of any conflict of interest question involving a director or an executive officer to the \nNominating and Governance Committee and the resolution of any conflict of interest issue involving any other officer of the Company to the \nCEO. In addition, each of our officers and directors have confirmed their ongoing obligation to notify management of their outside activities, \nwhich enables management to monitor future potential conflicts of interest, whether with GE or other third parties.\nWe may not be able to arrange for the termination or replacement of, and the release of GE and its subsidiaries from, the \nremaining parent company credit support obligations. \nTo support GE Vernova in selling products and services globally, prior to the \nSpin-Off, GE entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting \nthe performance of what are subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers of GE Vernova, in addition to having provided \nsimilar credit support for some non-customer related activities of GE Vernova (collectively, “GE credit support”), which is further described \nin \"Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions— Agreements with GE—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit \nSupport” section in the Information Statement. The Separation and Distribution Agreement requires us to use reasonable best efforts to \narrange for the termination or replacement of, and the release of GE and its subsidiaries from, all GE credit support. See Item 7. \n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Parent \nCompany Credit Support\" for information about the amounts of the parent \ncompany guarantees.\n For the obligations that remain outstanding \nunder GE credit support, we are required to indemnify GE against any amounts paid in connection with such GE credit support. Pursuant to \nthe Separation and Distribution Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions and covenants with respect to contracts underlying GE \ncredit support under which GE or its subsidiaries remain liable, including a prohibition on certain amendments and on any disposition of \nsuch contracts (including indirectly through dispositions of our subsidiaries). These provisions may restrict us from extending contracts, or \namending contracts in a manner which increases GE’s obligations under, outstanding GE credit support, or require us to obtain third-party \n2024 FORM 10-K \n30\ncredit support with respect to such obligations. In each case, these provisions could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our objectives \nand adversely affect our business. In addition, so long as obligations remain outstanding under GE credit support, unless GE otherwise \nconsents, it will be a condition to any acquisition or change of control of GE Vernova that the acquiring person have the financial and \noperational capacity to satisfy those obligations, have unsecured investment grade ratings, and agree to be bound by all the same \nprovisions applicable to us under the Separation and Distribution Agreement with respect to the GE credit support, or we, or such acquiring \nperson will be required to provide third-party credit support reasonably acceptable to GE with respect to such GE credit support. This \ncondition may discourage, delay, or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition, or change in \ncontrol of GE Vernova, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to \nsell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price. For more information on our obligations pertaining to the \nGE credit support, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity—Parent \nCompany Credit Support” and “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit \nSupport” in the Information Statement.\nWe or GE may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation. \nIn connection \nwith the separation, we and GE entered into various transaction agreements related to the Spin-Off. All of these agreements govern our \nrelationship with GE . We rely on GE to satisfy its performance obligations under these agreements. If we or GE are unable to satisfy our or \nits respective obligations under these agreements, including indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations, cash flows, \nand financial condition could be adversely affected. See “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” in the Information \nStatement.\nCertain non-U.S. entities or assets that are part of our separation from GE were not transferred to us prior to the Spin-Off and \nmay not be at all. \nCertain non-U.S. entities and assets that were part of our separation from GE were not transferred prior to the Spin-Off \nbecause the entities or assets, as applicable, were subject to foreign government or third-party approvals that we did not receive prior to \nthe Spin-Off. Such approvals included, but are not limited to, approvals to merge or separate, to form new legal entities (including obtaining \nrequired registrations and/or licenses or permits), and to transfer assets and/or liabilities. Although most material transfers occurred without \ndelays beyond the Distribution Date, we cannot offer any assurance that such transfers will ultimately occur or not be delayed for an \nextended period of time. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the economic consequences of owning such assets and/or \nentities are, to the extent reasonably possible and permitted by applicable law, provided to us. In the event such transfers do not ultimately \noccur or are significantly delayed because we do not receive the required approvals, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our \nseparation from GE and we may be dependent on GE for transition services for a longer period of time than would otherwise be the case.\nTransfer or assignment to us of some contracts, joint ventures, and other assets required the consent of a third party. If such \nconsent is not given or if its requirement is used to obtain more favorable contractual terms, we may not be entitled to some or \nall of the benefit of such contracts, joint ventures, investments, and other assets in the future. \nTransfer or assignment of some of \nthe contracts, joint ventures, and other assets in connection with the Spin-Off and change of control in the ownership structure following the \nSpin-Off required the consent of a third party to the transfer or assignment. Similarly, in some circumstances, we are joint beneficiaries of \ncontracts, and we need to enter into a new agreement with the third party to replicate the existing contract or assign the portion of the \nexisting contract related to our business. While we endeavored to cause these contract and joint ventures transfers, assignments, \nconsents, and new agreements to be obtained prior to the Spin-Off, we were not able to obtain all required consents, or enter into all such \nagreements, as applicable. Some parties may use the requirement of a consent to seek more favorable contractual terms from us, which \ncould require us to accept a lower economic benefit from the contract or joint venture, or include our having to obtain letters of credit or \nother forms of credit support. If we are unable to obtain such consents or such credit support on commercially reasonable and satisfactory \nterms, we may be unable to obtain some of the benefits, assets, and contractual commitments that are intended to be allocated to us as \npart of the Spin-Off. In addition, where we do not intend to seek consent from third-party counterparties based on our understanding that no \nconsent is required, the third-party counterparties may challenge the transaction on the basis that the terms of the applicable commercial \narrangements require their consent. We may incur substantial litigation and other costs in connection with any such claims and, if we do not \nprevail, our ability to use these assets could be adversely impacted.\nWe cannot provide assurance that all such required third-party consents and agreements will be procured or put in place. Consequently, we \nmay not realize certain of the benefits that are intended to be allocated to us as part of the Spin-Off.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly. \nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors, \nsome of which may be beyond our control. The nature of our business and industry subject us, and our stock price, \nto \nvolatility\n.\n Should the \nmarket price of our shares drop significantly, stockholders may institute securities class action lawsuits against us. A lawsuit against us \ncould cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nWe may not achieve our target for returning our cash generation to our stockholders and the amounts we do return may be less \nthan planned. \nIn December 2024, we announced our plan to return at least one-third of our cash generation to our stockholders. In \nconnection with that plan, our Board initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of our common stock, which we paid in January \n2025, and a share repurchase authorization of up to $6 billion. Our ability to return cash to our stockholders will depend on our earnings, \nfinancial condition, cash requirements, other potential cash uses, prospects, and other factors. Further, the price, availability, and trading \nvolumes of our common stock will affect the timing and size of any share repurchases. As a result, we may not achieve our targeted level \nfor returning cash generation to our stockholders and any amounts we do return may be less than planned. \nHolders of our common stock may be diluted due to equity issuances. \nIn the future, holders of our common stock may be diluted \nbecause of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions, or otherwise, including any equity awards that we will grant to our \ndirectors, officers, and employees. We award our directors, officers, certain of our employees and others with stock-based awards as part \nof our ongoing equity compensation program, and some of those persons also received stock-based awards from GE prior to the Spin-Off \nthat converted to our stock-based awards. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect \nthe market price of our common stock. We have and plan to issue additional stock-based awards, including annual awards, new hire \n2024 FORM 10-K \n31\nawards, and periodic retention awards, as applicable, to our directors, officers, and other employees under our employee benefits plans as \npart of our ongoing equity compensation program.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law may \ndiscourage takeovers and limit the power of our stockholders. \nSeveral provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the \nSeparation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include, \namong others, provisions that (i) classify our board of directors until 2029 whereby not all members are elected at one time, which could \ndelay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; (ii) provide for the removal of directors \nonly for cause during the time the Board is classified; (iii) establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and \nproposals; (iv) limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or act by written consent; (v) provide the Board the right to issue \nshares of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and (vi) provide for the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies \non the Board (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board). We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General \nCorporation Law (DGCL), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that\n our stockholders \nmay favor. In \naddition, we are subject to the restrictions on change of control transactions under the Separation and Distribution Agreement described \nunder “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit \nSupport” in the Information Statement.\nThese and other provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law, as \nwell as the restrictions in our Tax Matters Agreement (see “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE\n—Tax Matters Agreement” in the Information Statement), may discourage, delay, or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual \nor a threatened acquisition or change in control of GE Vernova, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may \noffer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price. Our Board \nbelieves these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to \nnegotiate with the Board and by providing the Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. \nOur certificate of incorporation provides that certain courts in the State of Delaware or the federal district courts of the U.S. will \nbe the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our \nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. \nOur \ncertificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located \nwithin the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action \nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee, agent, or stockholder to us or our \nstockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws, or any action \nasserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction \nover such action, the action may be brought in another court of the State of Delaware or, if no court of the State of Delaware has \njurisdiction, then in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation states that the foregoing \nprovision will not apply to claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act). Unless we consent in writing to the \nselection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of \nany complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The exclusive forum provisions will be applicable to the fullest \nextent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over \nall suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the \nexclusive forum provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for \nwhich the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. There is, however, uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the exclusive forum \nprovisions, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, \nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or \nliability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and, to \nthe fullest extent permitted by law, to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. The choice of \nforum provision may result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim. Further, the choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s \nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other employees, or \nstockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders. However, the \nenforceability of similar forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings. If a \ncourt were to find the exclusive choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in \nan action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.",
  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF \nOPERATIONS. \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction \nwith our consolidated and combined financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting \nprinciples (GAAP), and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis \nprovides information that management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the \nCompany for the \nyears ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions, \nexcept for per-share amounts which are presented in U.S. dollars. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of \nrounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Unless otherwise noted, \nstatements related to changes in operating results relate to the corresponding period in the prior year. \nRefer to the \"Management's \n2024 FORM 10-K \n35\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in the \nInformation\n Statement \nfor \ndiscussions\n of results \nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 versus 2022.\nIn the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and combined financial \ndata but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP \nfinancial measures” under SEC rules. For the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most \ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures, see \"\n—\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nTRENDS AND FACTORS IMPACTING OUR PERFORMANCE.\n \nWe believe our performance and future success depends on a \nnumber of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in \nItem 1A. \"Risk Factors.\"\nOur worldwide operations are affected by regional and global factors impacting energy demand, including industry trends like \ndecarbonization, an increasing demand for r\nenewable\n energy alternatives, and changes in broader economic and geopolitical conditions\n. \nThese trends, along with the growing focus on the digitization and sustainability of the electricity infrastructure, drive growth across each of \nour business segments. We believe that our industry-defining technologies and commitment to innovation position us well to capitalize on \nthese long-term trends:\n•\nDemand growth for electricity generation\n – Significant investment, infrastructure, and supply diversity will be essential to help meet \nforecasted energy demand growth arising from population and global economic growth.\n•\nDecarbonization\n – The urgency to combat climate change is fueling technology advancements that improve the economic viability and \nefficiency of r\nenewable\n energy alternatives and facilitate the transition to a more sustainable power sector. \n•\nEvolving generation mix\n – The power industry is shifting from coal generation to more electricity generated from zero- or low-carbon \nenergy sources, and an evolving balance of generation sources will be necessary to maintain a reliable, resilient and affordable \nsystem.\n•\nEnergy resilience & security\n – Threats and challenges from extreme weather events, cyber-attacks, and geopolitical tensions have \nincreased focus on the strength and resilience of power generation and transmission and reinforced the need for a diversified mix of \nenergy sources.\n•\nGrid modernization and investment\n – Increased demand and the integration of advanced generation and storage solutions drive the \nneed to update aging infrastructure with new grid integration and automation solutions.\n•\nRegulatory and policy changes \n– Government policies and regulations, such as carbon pricing, renewable energy mandates, and \nsubsidies for renewable energy technologies, can significantly impact the power generation landscape. Staying ahead of regulatory \nchanges and adapting to new compliance requirements is crucial for maintaining a competitive advantage.\n•\nFinancial and investment dynamics\n – Access to capital and investment trends in the energy sector can influence the development and \ndeployment of new power generation projects. Understanding market dynamics and securing funding are key to progressing strategic \ninitiatives.\nTRANSITION TO STAND-ALONE \nCO\nMPANY\n \nFinancial Presentation Under GE Ownership.\n \nWe completed our separation from \nGeneral Electric Company (GE)\n, which now operates \nas GE Aerospace, on April 2, 2024 (the Spin-Off). In connection with the Spin-Off, GE distrib\nute\nd all of the shares of our common stock to \nits stockholders and we became an independent company. \nHistorically, as a business of GE, we relied on GE to manage certain of our \noperations and provide certain services, the costs of which were either allocated or directly billed to us. Accordingly, our historical costs for \nsuch services may not necessarily reflect the actual expenses we would have incurred, or will incur, as an independent company and may \nnot reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, stand-alone company during the historical \nperiods presented. \nSee Note \n1\n in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information\n.\nStand-Alone Company Expenses.\n \nAs a result of the Spin-Off, we are subject to the requirements of the federal and state securities laws \nand stock exchange requirements. We have \nestablished \nadditional procedures and practices as a stand-alone public company. As a result, \nwe \nare incurring \nadditional costs related to external reporting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, corporate governance, and stock \nadministration.\nProduction Tax Credit \nInvestments. \nOur Financial Services business offers a wide range of financial solutions to customers and projects \nthat utilize our Power and Wind products and services. These solutions historically included making minority investments in projects, often \nthrough common or preferred equity investments where we generally seek to exit as soon as practicable once a project achieves \ncommercial operation. Many such investments are in renewable energy U.S. tax equity vehicles that generate various tax credits, including \nproduction tax credits (PTCs), which can be used to offset an equity partner’s tax liabilities in the U.S. and support the overall target return \non investment. In connection with the Spin-Off, GE retained all renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments of \n$1.2 billion\n and any tax \nattributes from historical tax equity investing activity. We manage these investments under the Framework Investment Agreement with GE. \nAdditionally, \nduring the second quarter, in connection with GE retaining the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments, we recognized a \n$0.1 billion\n benefit, recorded in Cost of equipment, related to deferred intercompany profit from historical equipment sales to the related \ninvestees. See Notes \n11\n, \n21\n and \n23\n in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.\nDISPOSITION ACTIVITY\n.\n \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, our Steam Power business completed the sale of part of its nuclear \nactivities to Electricité de France S.A. (EDF). In connection with the disposition, we received net cash proceeds of \n$0.6 billion\n, which is \ns\nubject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments\n. As a\n result, we recog\nnized a pre-tax gain of \n$1.0 billion\n recorded \nin Other income (expense) – net in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). See Not\nes \n3\n, \n15\n, \n16\n and \n19\n in\n the Notes \nto the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.\nARBITRATION REFUND\n.\n \nIn June 2024, we received \n$306 million\n in cash, which represented the return of cash payments we \npreviously made relating to two partial withdrawal liability assessments issued by a multiemployer pension plan (Fund) to which we \ncontribute, plus interest on such amounts. We challenged the assessments in arbitration, but under ERISA, we were required to make \n2024 FORM 10-K \n36\nmonthly payments from May 2019 to September 2023 while the matter was arbitrated. In December 2023, an arbitrator ruled that we were \nexempt from the alleged liability, a decision that was appealed in January 2024 in a U.S. district court. That court upheld the arbitration \nruling in February 2025. The appeal period for that court's ruling has not expired. The arbitration ruling triggered a legal obligation for the \nFund to return the payments to us with interest, which it did in June 2024. During the second quarter, \n$254 million\n of cash, constituting the \npayments previously made to the Fund, was recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expenses and \n$52 million\n of cash, constituting \ninterest on such amounts, was recorded in Interest and other financial charges – net in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of \nIncome (Loss). As this dispute is not yet resolved, we cannot predict its ultimate resolution, including whether we will retain the funds \nfollowing all final appeals, whether we are entitled to additional interest, or whether the Fund may contend it is owed interest if it prevails. \nOFFSH\nORE\n WIND.\n \nOn July 13, 2024, a wind turbine blade event occurred, related to a manufacturing deviation, at the Vineyard Wind \noffshore wind farm where we are the manufacturer and supplier of our newly developed Haliade-X 220m wind turbines (Haliade-X). On July \n15, 2024, \nBSEE\n issued a suspension order to cease power production and the installation of new wind turbines at the project site. On \nAugust 10, 2024, BSEE issued a superseding order allowing us to resume the installation of towers and nacelles, subject to certain \nconditions. On October 22, 2024, BSEE issued another superseding order allowing us to resume the installation of new blades, subject to \ncertain conditions. In December, the first new blade set was installed, and commercial power production by that turbine commenced. On \nJanuary 17, 2025, BSEE terminated its suspension order. Going forward, the installation of new blades and the production of power are \nsubject to specified conditions and we will be required to remove blades previously installed. In addition to the blade event at the Vineyard \nWind offshore wind farm, there have been blade events in prior quarters related to commissioning and installation at the Dogger Bank \noffshore wind farm. \nAs we work through these issues, we are gaining experience across our Haliade-X backlog related to installation timelines, including vessel \navailability, manufacturing and quality control processes, and various other project activities. Based on this experience, we are developing \nand implementing our remediation plans, which includes updates to our project timelines to account for the slower pace of execution.\nAs a result of the above, we recorded incremental contract losses of approximately $0.9 billion in the third and fourth quarters for both \nprojects which include the estimated impact of changes in execution timelines, project-related commercial liabilities, costs to remediate \nquality issues including the removal of previously installed blades at the Vineyard Wind project, and additional project-related supply chain \nand manufacturing costs. Additional changes or other developments could have an adverse effect on our cash collection timelines and \ncontract margins and could result in further losses, which could be material.\nIn addition, on September 12, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement regarding a project that was previously canceled by a \ncustomer resulting in a gain of approximately $0.3 billion in the third quarter, which was recorded as $0.5 billion in revenues and $0.2 billion \nin cost of sales. The settlement included recovery of costs previously incurred on the canceled project.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nSummary of Results. \nRPO was \n$119.0 billion\n and \n$115.6 billion\n as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively. For the \nyear ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n, total revenues were \n$34.9 billion\n, an \nincrease\n of \n$1.7 billion\n for the year. Net income (loss) was \n$1.6 billion\n, an \nin\ncrease \nof \n$2.0 billion\n in net income for the year, and net income (loss) margin was \n4.5%\n. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was \n$5.58\n for \nthe \nyear ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n, an increase in diluted earnings per share of \n$7.18\n for the year. Cash flows from (used for) operating \nactivities were \n$2.6 billion\n and \n$1.2 billion\n for the \nyears ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively.\nFor the \nyear ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Adjusted EBITDA* was \n$2.0 billion\n, an \nincrease\n of \n$1.2 billion\n. Free cash flow* was \n$1.7 billion\n \nand \n$0.4 billion\n for the \nyears ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively.\nRPO, a measure of backlog, includes unfilled firm and unconditional customer orders for equipment and services, excluding any purchase \norder that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty.

As a result of completing the Spin-Off, we no longer participate in these arrangements and our \nC\nash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held and used solely for our own operations. Our capital structure, long-term commitments, \nand sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical practices. In connection with the Spin-Off, we received \n$0.8 billion\n of \ncash from GE through a cash contribution of \n$0.5 billion\n to fund future GE Vernova operations and a cash transfer of \n$0.3 billion\n restricted \nin connection with certain legal matters associated with legacy GE operations, such that our cash balance on the date of the completion of \nthe Spin-Off was approximately \n$4.2 billion\n. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was \n$8.2 billion\n, \n$0.4 billion\n of which was restricted use c\nash\n. \nDuring the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we received proceeds of\n $0.9 billion, net of \ndirectly attributable taxes paid, from the\n sales of a portion of our equity interest in \nGE Vernova T&D India Ltd\n (formerly known as GE T&D \nIndia Ltd)\n, \nproceeds of $0.2 billion from the sale of a portion of our investment in \nChina XD Electric Co., Ltd., net cash proceeds of $0.6 \nbillion\n from our Steam Power business sale of part of its nuclear activities to EDF, and a cash refund of $0.3 billion in connection with an \narbitration proceeding\n.\n In addition, we have access to a \n$3.0 billion\n committed revolving\n credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility). See “—\nCapital Resources and Liquidity—Debt” for further information. We believe our unrestricted c\nash, cash equivalents\n, \nfuture\n cash flows \n2024 FORM 10-K \n41\ngenerated from operations, and committed credit facility will be responsive to the needs of our current and planned operations for at least \nthe next 12 months.\nOn December 10, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend on the outstanding common stock, which we \npaid on January 28, 2025, to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2024. In addition, on December 10, 2024, we announced that the \nBoard of Directors had authorized up to $6 billion of common stock repurchases.\nConsolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows.\n \nThe most significant source of cash flows from operations is customer-related \nactivities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. The most significant operating uses of cash are \nto pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and postretirement plans. We measure ourselves on a free cash flow* basis. We believe \nthat free cash flow* provides management and investors with an important measure of our ability to generate cash on a normalized basis. \nFree cash flow* also provides insight into our ability to produce cash subsequent to fulfilling our capital obligations; however, free cash flow* \ndoes not delineate funds available for discretionary uses as it does not deduct the payments required for certain investing and financing \nactivities.\nWe typically invest in \nPP&E\n over multiple periods to support new product introductions and increases in manufacturing capacity and to \nperform ongoing maintenance of our manufacturing operations. We believe that while PP&E expenditures will fluctuate period to period, we \nwill need to maintain a material level of net PP&E spend to maintain ongoing operations and growth of the business. \nFREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)\n2024\n2023\nCash from (used for) operating activities (GAAP)\n$\n2,583\n$\n1,186\nAdd: Gross additions to property, plant, and equipment and internal-use software\n(883)\n(744)\nFree cash flow (Non-GAAP)\n$\n1,701\n$\n442\nCash from (used for) operating activities\n was \n$2.6 billion\n and \n$1.2 billion\n \nfor the \nyears ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, \nrespectively. \nCash\n from (used for) operating activities increased by \n$1.4 billion\n in \n2024\n compared to \n2023\n primarily driven by: higher net income (after \nadjusting for depreciation of PP&E, amortization of intangible assets, and (gains) losses on purchases and sales of business interests) of \n$1.3 billion\n, including the impact of a $0.3 billion cash refund we received in connection with an arbitration proceeding in the second quarter \nof 2024; an increase of \n$1.7 billion \nin accounts payable and equipment project payables, \nprimarily due to lower disbursements, including a \nlower impact related to prepayments compared to the prior year, and higher purchases\n; partially offset by a \ndecrease\n in current contract \nassets of $(0.5) billion, due to higher revenue recognition, partially offset by an unfavorable change in estimated profitability, in Gas Power; \na decrease in current receivables of $(0.5) billion, primarily due to higher billings, an increase in past dues, and increases in supplier \nadvances; a decrease in inventories of $(0.4) billion, \nprimarily due to higher build in Power; and a decrease in due to related parties of \n$(0.3) billion, primarily due to settlements of payables with GE prior to the Spin-Off in 2024.\nCash from operating activities of $2.6 billion for the \nyear ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n included a $1.1 billion inflow from changes in working \ncapital.

See Notes \n7\n and \n22\n in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements \nfor further information \nregarding our obligations under lease and guarantee arrangements as well as our investment commitments. See Note \n13\n in the Notes to \nthe consolidated and combined financial statements \nfor further information regarding material cash requirements related to our pension \nobligations.\nDebt.\n As o\nf both \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, we had \n$0.1 billion\n of total debt, excluding finance leases. We have a \n$3.0 billion\n Revolving \nCredit Facility to fund near-term intra-quarter working capital needs as they arise. In addition, we have a \n$3.0 billion\n committed trade \nfinance facility (Trade Finance Facility, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, \nthe Credit Facilities\n). The Trade Finance Facility has \nnot been and is not expected to be utilized, and does not contribute to direct liquidity. We believe that our financing arrangements, future \ncash from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our future cash flow needs. For more \ninformation about the Credit Facilities, refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 2, 2024, and see Note 22 in the \nNotes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.\nCredit Ratings and Conditions.\n We have access to the Revolving Credit Facility to fund operations, and we may rely on debt capital \nmarkets in the future to further su\npport our liquidity needs. The cost and availability of any debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings \nand market conditions. Standard and Poor's Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) have issued credit ratings for the Company. \nOur credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the following table.\nS&P\nFitch\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nLong term\nBBB-\nBBB\nWe are disclosing our credit ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds \nand access to credit. Our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each \nrating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. S\nee Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\n—\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\n—\nRisks Relating to Operations and Supply Chain\" and Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\n—\nRisks Relating to Financial, Accounting, and Tax Matters\" \nfor a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings.\nIf we are unable to maintain investment grade ratings, we could face significant challenges in being awarded new contracts, substantially \nincreasing financing and hedging costs, and refinancing risks as well as substantially decreasing the availability of credit. As of \nDecember \n31, 2024\n, we \nestimated an \ninsignificant\n \nliquidity impact of a ratings downgrade below investment grade.\nParent Company Credit Support. \nPrior t\no\n the Spin-Off, to support GE Vernova businesses in selling products and services globally, GE \noften entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the \nperformance of its subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for non-\ncustomer related activities of GE Vernova \n(collectively, the GE credit support)\n. In connection with the Spin-Off, we are working to seek \nnovation or assignment of GE credit support, the majority of which relates to parent company guarantees, associated with GE Vernova \nlegal entities from GE to GE Vernova. For GE credit support that remained outstanding at the Spin-Off, GE Vernova is obligated to use \nreasonable best efforts to terminate or replace, and obtain a full release of GE’s obligations and liabilities under, all such credit support. \nB\neginning in 2025, GE Vernova will pay a quarterly fee to GE based on amounts related to the GE credit support. \nGE Vernova is subject to \nother contractual restrictions and requirements while GE continues to be obligated under such credit support on behalf of GE Vernova. In \naddition, w\nhile GE will remain obligated under the contract or instrument, GE Vernova will be obligated to indemnify GE for credit support \nrelated payments that GE is required to make and possible related costs\n.\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we estimated GE Vernova RPO and other obligations that relate to GE credit support to be approximately \n$17 \nbillion\n, an over \n74%\n reduction since \nDecember 31, 2023\n and over \n52%\n reduction since the Spin-Off. We expect approximately \n$10 billion\n of \nthe RPO related to GE credit support obligations to contractually mature within five years from \nDecember 31, 2024\n. The underlying \nobligations are predominantly customer contracts that GE Vernova performs in the normal course of its business. We have no known \ninstances historically where payments or performance from GE were required under parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova \ncustomer contracts. \nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n.\n \nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note \n2\n \nin the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n. \nTo prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with U.S. \nGAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our \ncontingent liabilities, as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting \nperiods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (i) if we are required to make assumptions \nabout material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (ii) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is \nreasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and \nrequire management’s judgment: Allocations from GE, Revenue Recognition on Service Agreements, Revenue Recognition on Equipment \non an Over-Time Basis, Goodwill, Income Taxes, Postretirement Benefit Plans, Loss Contingencies, and Environmental and Asset \nRetirement Obligations. See Note \n2\n in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information regarding \nour significant accounting policies.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n43\nAllocations From GE. \nThe consolidated and combined financial statements include expense allocations prior to the Spin-Off for certain \ncorporate, infrastructure, and shared services expenses provided by GE on a centralized basis, including, but not limited to, finance, supply \nchain, human resources, IT, insurance, employee benefits, and other expenses that are either specifically identifiable or clearly applicable \nto GE Vernova. These expenses have been allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a \npro rata basis using an applicable measure of headcount, revenue, or other allocation methodologies that are considered to be a \nreasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by GE Vernova during the periods presented. \nManagement considers that such allocations have been made on a reasonable basis; however, these allocations may not be indicative of \nthe actual expense that would have been incurred had we operated as an independent, stand-alone public entity.\nRevenue Recognition on Service Agreements.\n \nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers within our Power and Wind \nsegments that require us to maintain the customers’ assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. \nPower.\n Within Power, these long-term service agreements, which we refer to as contractual service agreements, generally include \nmaintenance associated with major outage events and revenues are recognized as we perform under the arrangements using the \npercentage of completion method, which is based on costs incurred relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to \nmake estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required \nmaintenance services.\nCustomers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major \nmaintenance event within the contract. As a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how \ncustomers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, \nimpacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers’ asset utilization \nwill influence the timing and extent of maintenance events over the life of the contract. We generally use historical utilization trends in \ndeveloping our revenue estimates. To develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance events, \nincluding the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services.\nWe routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. These \nrevisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the \nrights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract \nasset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified \ncontract as a new contract.\nWe regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract \nassets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer \ntermination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of \nequipment and close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions \nmay affect a long-term services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our net long-term service agreements balance of $3.5 billion represents approximately 5% of our total estimated \nlife of contract billings. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 29% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of \nfuture costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one \npercentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements contract assets balance by $0.2 billion. Billings on these \ncontracts were $5.0 billion during both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. See Notes \n2\n and \n9\n in the Notes to the consolidated \nand combined financial statements for further information. \nWind. \nThe equipment within our Wind segment generally does not require major planned outages and revenues associated with service \nagreements are recognized on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of these arrangements, which generally \ninclude planned and unplanned maintenance and may also include performance guarantees of the wind farm’s availability to operate under \nadequate wind conditions. Availability is typically measured across the wind farm over a reference period of one year. Any forecasted \nshortfalls that may result in a payment to a customer are recorded as a reduction of revenues, while additional revenues are recognized \nwhen availability exceeds the contractual targets. During the \nyears ended Decemb\ner 31, 2024, 2023,\n and 2022, t\nhe reduction of revenues \nfrom availability shortfalls was $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. A further 1% reduction in availability across the entire \nfleet would have resulted in an additional revenue reduction of less than $0.1 billion.\nRevenue Recognition on Equipment on an Over-Time Basis.\n \nWe have agreements for the sale of customized goods, including power \ngeneration equipment such as gas and certain wind turbines. We recognize revenues as we perform under the arrangements using the \npercentage of completion method, which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This \nrequires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to complete the \nproject. In addition, variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is expected that a significant future \nreversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Some of our contracts with customers for the sale of equipment contain \nclauses for liquidated damages related to milestones established for on-time delivery or meeting certain product specifications. On an \nongoing basis, we evaluate the probability and magnitude of having to pay liquidated damages. This is factored into our estimate of variable \nconsideration using the expected value method taking into consideration progress towards meeting contractual milestones, specified \nliquidated damages rates, if applicable, and history of paying liquidated damages to the customer or similar customers. \nOur\n billing terms for these agreements are generally based on achieving specified milestones and include billing adjustments for project \ndelays and performance guarantees. As a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating project \nexecution timelines that may be adjusted due to internal and external supply chain adjustments, overall project execution, and product \nperformance. We generally use a combination of historical information as well as forward-looking information surrounding project execution \ntimelines and product performance in developing our revenue estimates. To develop our revenue estimates, we start with the contract price \nand then make downward revisions based on historical trends. In addition, we also adjust as we become aware of new information.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n44\nOur estimation of the total costs required to fulfill our promise to a customer is generally based on our history of manufacturing similar \nassets for customers. This estimation of cost is critical to our revenue recognition process and is updated routinely to reflect changes in \nquantity or cost of the inputs. In certain projects, the underlying technology or promise to the customer is unique to what we have \nhistorically promised, and reliably estimating the total cost to fulfill the promise to the customer requires a significant level of judgment. The \nestimation of costs is subject to increased subjectivity when we introduce new products and technologies, and actual costs may differ from \nestimates more widely at this stage of development due to lack of historical experience.\nWe routinely review estimates and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. These revisions are based on objectively \nverifiable information that is available at the time of the review.\nGoodwill. \nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter of each year using October 1st as the \nmeasurement date. We also test goodwill for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not \nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting \nunit exceeds its fair value.\nWe determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income \napproach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time \nwe perform the valuation. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.\nUnder the market approach fair value is derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of \ncomparable businesses, when available. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units \noperate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. A market approach is limited to \nreporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have characteristics similar to our businesses.\nUnder the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an \nappropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective \nbusinesses and in our internally developed forecasts.\nBased on the results of the impairment tests as of October 1, 2024, the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their \ncarrying values. Estimating the fair value of reporting units involves the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors \nincluding actual operating results, internal forecasts, such as forecasts of costs, margins, investments and capital expenditures, market \nobservable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate \ndiscount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting \napplied to each approach. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. \nSee \nNote \n8\n in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements \nfor further information.\nIncome Taxes.\n \nPrior to the Spin-Off, GE Vernova was included in the consolidated U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns of \nGE, where eligible, through April 2, 2024. We have adopted the separate return method in preparing a provision for income taxes for the \nperiods prior to the Spin-off. The calculation of income taxes on a separate return basis requires considerable judgment and use of both \nestimates and allocations. As a result, our provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflected in our consolidated \nand combined financial statements for the periods 2022, 2023, and the first quarter of 2024 have been estimated as if we were a separate \ntaxpayer. Following the Spin-off, GE Vernova will file tax returns independently and our provision for income taxes is prepared on a stand-\nalone basis.\nWe only recognize the tax benefits from income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon \nexamination by the taxing authorities. A liability is recorded for uncertain tax positions when there is a 50 percent or less likelihood such tax \nposition would\n \nbe sustained based on its technical merits. Significant judgement is required when evaluating tax positions for uncertainty. \nWe re-evaluate uncertain tax positions upon changes in facts and circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, and upon effective \nsettlement of issues with tax authorities. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material \nincreases or decreases in our provision (benefit) for income taxes in the period such determination is made.\nWe record deferred taxes on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of our assets and \nliabilities and their respective tax basis. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on sufficient sources of taxable income. Possible \nsources of taxable income include taxable income in carry-back periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences \nrecorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income, and projected future taxable income. If, based upon \nall available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation \nallowance is recorded to adjust the deferred tax assets to the net amount which is more likely than not to be realized. Significant weight is \ngiven to evidence that is objectively verifiable such as cumulative losses in recent years; however, some evidence may be based on \nestimates and assumptions regarding potential sources of future taxable income. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may result \nin a change in judgement regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets.\nBased on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we continue to maintain valuation \nallowances against our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to cumulative losses in those \njurisdictions. Given the current year profit and anticipated future profitability in the U.S., it is reasonably possible that the continued \nimprovement in our U.S. operations could result in the positive evidence necessary to warrant the release of a significant portion of our U.S. \nvaluation allowance as early as the second half of 2025. A release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain U.S. \ndeferred tax assets and a corresponding benefit in our provision for income taxes in the period the release occurs. See Note \n15\n in the \nNotes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.\nPostretirement Benefit Plans.\n \nWe engage third-party actuaries to assist in the determination of pension obligations and related plan \ncosts. We develop significant long-term assumptions including discount rates and the expected rate of return on assets in connection with \n2024 FORM 10-K \n45\nour pension accounting. We recognize differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets, the actual return, and net \nactuarial gains and losses for the pension plan liabilities annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is \ndetermined to qualify for a remeasurement within the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAccounting requirements necessitate the use of assumptions to reflect the uncertainties and the length of time over which the pension \nobligations will be paid. The actual amount of future benefit payments will depend upon when participants retire, the amount of their benefit \nat retirement, and how long they live. We discount the future payments using a rate that matches the time frame over which the payments \nwill be made. We also assume a long-term rate of return that will be earned on investments used to fund these payments. \nWe evaluate these assumptions annually. We periodically evaluate other assumptions, such as compensation, retirement age, mortality, \nand turnover, and update them as necessary to reflect our actual experience and expectations for the future.\nWe determine the discount rate using the weighted-average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities that have maturities consistent \nwith the timing of benefit payments. Lower discount rates increase the size of the benefit obligations and generally increase pension \nexpense in the following year; higher discount rates reduce the size of the benefit obligation and generally reduce subsequent-year pension \nexpense. \nThe expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the \npension obligations. To determine this rate, we consider the current and target composition of plan investments, our historical returns \nearned, and our expectation about the future. \nAs of the measurement date of \nDecember 31, 2024\n,\n net periodic benefit income for 2025 is estimated to be $0.5 billion. \nThe components of \nnet periodic benefit costs, other than the service component, are included in Non-operating benefit income in our Consolidated and \nCombined Statement of Income (Loss).\nFluctuations in discount rates can significantly impact pension costs and obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would \nincrease our principal pension plan cost in the following year by less than \n$0.1\n billion and would also expect an increase in the principal \npension plan projected benefit obligation at year-end by approximately \n$0.2\n billion. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on \nassets would increase principal pension plan cost in the following year by approximately \n$0.1\n billion. See\n Note \n13\n in the Notes to the \nconsolidated and combined financial statements for further information.\nLoss\n \nContingencies\n. \nLoss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that \nwill ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, warranties, \nenvironmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and losses resulting from other events and developments. \nWhen a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. \nWe consider many factors in making these assessments, including historical experience and matter specifics. Estimates are developed in \nconsultation with legal counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results.\nWhen there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. However, the \nlikelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a \nrange of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or \ndecisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be \nresolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine \nboth the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for \nmaterial loss contingencies when a loss is probable, but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a \nloss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the \nlikelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note \n22\n in the \nNotes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.\nEnvironmental\n \nand\n \nAsset\n \nRetirement\n \nObligations\n.\n Our operations involve the use, disposal, and cleanup of substances regulated under \nenvironmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental \nremediation activities and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites or as a result of any restructuring \nactions taken in future periods. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various \nlawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear \ndecommissioning and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries.\nWe record asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets as a liability in the period in which the \nobligation is \nincurred\n and its fair value can be reasonably estimated. These obligations primarily represent legal obligations to return leased \npremises to their initial state or dismantle and repair specific alterations for certain leased sites. The liability is measured at the present \nvalue of the obligation when incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part \nof the carrying value of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. See Note \n22\n i\nn the Notes to the \nconsolidated and combined financial statements \nfor further information.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n.\n \nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are \nsupplemental measures of our performance and our liquidity that we believe help investors understand our financial condition and operating \nresults and assess our future prospects. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding \nU.S. GAAP financial measures, are important supplemental measures that exclude non-cash or other items that may not be indicative of or \nare unrelated to our core operating results and the overall health of the Company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures \nprovide investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allow investors to \nsee our results “through the eyes of management.” We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding \nour operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. When read in \nconjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying \n2024 FORM 10-K \n46\nbusinesses and can be used by management as one basis for financial, operational, and planning decisions. Finally, these measures are \noften used by analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\nManagement recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by \nother companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes, thereby affecting their comparability from \ncompany to company. In order to compensate for these and the other limitations discussed below, management does not consider these \nmeasures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Readers \nshould review the reconciliations below, and above with respect to free cash flow, and should not rely on any single financial measure to \nevaluate our business. The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable \nU.S. GAAP financial measures follow.\nWe believe the organic measures presented below provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying \noperating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency, \nwhich includes translational and transactional impacts, as these activities can obscure underlying trends.\nORGANIC REVENUES, EBITDA, AND EBITDA MARGIN BY SEGMENT (NON-GAAP)\nRevenue(a)\nSegment EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA margin\n2024\n2023\nV%\n2024\n2023\nV%\n2024\n2023\nV pts\nPower (GAAP)\n$\n18,127\n$\n17,436\n4\n%\n$\n2,268\n$\n1,722\n32\n%\n12.5\n%\n9.9\n%\n2.6pts\nLess: Acquisitions\n41\n—\n14\n—\nLess: Business dispositions\n127\n643\n(21)\n(19)\nLess: Foreign currency effect\n12\n2\n(35)\n(118)\nPower organic (Non-GAAP)\n$\n17,947\n$\n16,791\n7\n%\n$\n2,310\n$\n1,859\n24\n%\n12.9\n%\n11.1\n%\n1.8pts\nWind (GAAP)\n$\n9,701\n$\n9,826\n(1)\n%\n$\n(588)\n$\n(1,033)\n43\n%\n(6.1)\n%\n(10.5)\n%\n4.4pts\nLess: Acquisitions\n—\n—\n—\n—\nLess: Business dispositions\n—\n—\n—\n—\nLess: Foreign currency effect\n(40)\n(52)\n(52)\n(112)\nWind organic (Non-GAAP)\n$\n9,741\n$\n9,878\n(1)\n%\n$\n(536)\n$\n(922)\n42\n%\n(5.5)\n%\n(9.3)\n%\n3.8pts\nElectrification (GAAP)\n$\n7,550\n$\n6,378\n18\n%\n$\n679\n$\n234\nF\n9.0\n%\n3.7\n%\n5.3pts\nLess: Acquisitions\n3\n1\n(3)\n—\nLess: Business dispositions\n—\n—\n—\n—\nLess: Foreign currency effect\n22\n16\n(16)\n(27)\nElectrification organic (Non-GAAP)\n$\n7,525\n$\n6,361\n18\n%\n$\n698\n$\n261\nF\n9.3\n%\n4.1\n%\n5.2pts\n(a) Includes intersegment sales\n of \n$483 million\n and \n$414 million\n for the \nyears ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively.
