  "item1": "ITEM 1.     BUSINESS\n \nGeneral\nErie Indemnity Company (\"Indemnity\", \"we\", \"us\", \"our\") is a publicly held Pennsylvania business corporation that has since its incorporation in 1925 served as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the Erie Insurance Exchange (\"Exchange\").  The Exchange, which also commenced business in 1925, is a Pennsylvania-domiciled reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance.  The Exchange has wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries including:  Erie Insurance Company, Erie Insurance Company of New York, Erie Insurance Property & Casualty Company and Flagship City Insurance Company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, Erie Family Life Insurance Company (\"EFL\"). \nOur primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange with respect to all claims handling and investment management services, as well as the service provider for all claims handling, life insurance, and investment management services for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries, collectively referred to as \"administrative services\".  Acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities is done in accordance with a subscriber's agreement (a limited power of attorney) executed individually by each subscriber (policyholder), which appoints Indemnity as each subscriber's attorney-in-fact to transact certain business on their behalf.  In accordance with the subscriber’s agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we retain a management fee calculated as a percentage, not to exceed 25%, of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The management fee rate is set at least annually by our Board of Directors.  The process of setting the management fee rate includes, but is not limited to, the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both Indemnity and the Exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including, but not limited to: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position.\nBusiness Segments\nWe operate under a single reportable segment: management operations.  Financial information about this segment is set forth in and referenced to Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Segment Information, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained within this report.  Further discussion of financial results for our single operating segment is provided in and referenced to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained within this report.\nServices\nThe policy issuance and renewal services we provide on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies.  The sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services.  Agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as incentive compensation, which is earned by achieving targeted measures.  Agent compensation comprised approximately 69% of our 2024 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 9% of our 2024 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support.  We also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 9% of our 2024 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.\nConsistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions.  Life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business.  Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions.  The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity.  Reimbursements are settled at cost.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department. \n3\nTable of Contents\nErie Insurance Exchange\nAs our primary purpose is to manage the affairs at the Exchange for the benefit of the subscribers (policyholders) through the policy issuance and renewal services and administrative services, the Exchange is our sole customer.  Our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  We have no direct competition in providing these services to the Exchange.  \nThe Exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 71% of the 2024 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 29%.  The principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  The principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.  Historically, due to policy renewal and sales patterns, the Exchange's direct and affiliated assumed written premiums tend to be greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year.\nThe Exchange is represented by independent agencies that serve as its sole distribution channel.  In addition to their principal role as salespersons, the independent agents play a significant role as underwriting and service providers and are an integral part of the Exchange's success.\nOur results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the Exchange.  If any events occurred that impaired the Exchange's ability to grow or sustain its financial condition, including but not limited to reduced financial strength ratings, disruption in the independent agency relationships, significant catastrophe losses, or products not meeting customer demands, the Exchange could find it more difficult to retain its existing business and attract new business.  A decline in the business of the Exchange almost certainly could have as a consequence a decline in the total premiums paid and a correspondingly adverse effect on the amount of the management fees we receive.  We also have an exposure to a concentration of credit risk related to the unsecured receivables due from the Exchange for net management fee and other reimbursements.  See Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16, Concentrations of Credit Risk, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report.  See the risk factors related to our dependency on the growth and financial condition of the Exchange in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report. \nCompetition\nOur primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange, as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.  There are a limited number of companies that provide services under a reciprocal insurance exchange structure.  We do not directly compete against other such companies, given we are appointed by the subscribers at the Exchange to provide these services.  \nThe direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange drive our management fee, which is our primary source of revenue.  The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive.  Property and casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of customer service, price, consumer recognition, coverages offered, claims handling, financial stability and geographic coverage.  Vigorous competition, particularly in the personal lines automobile and homeowners lines of business, exists from large, well-capitalized national companies, some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents, by smaller regional insurers, and by large companies who market and sell personal lines products directly to consumers.  Innovations by competitors or other market participants may also increase the level of competition in the industry.  In addition, because the insurance products of the Exchange are marketed exclusively through independent insurance agents, the Exchange faces competition within its appointed agencies based upon ease of doing business, product, price, and service relationships.\nMarket competition bears directly on the price charged for insurance products and services subject to regulatory limitations.  Industry capital levels can also significantly affect prices charged for coverage.  Growth is driven by a company's ability to provide insurance services and competitive prices while maintaining target profit margins.  Growth is a product of a company's ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers, as well as movement in the average premium per policy.  \nThe Exchange's business model is designed to provide the advantages of localized marketing and claims servicing with the economies of scale and low cost of operations from centralized support services.  Indemnity, as part of its role managing and conducting the business and affairs of the Exchange, also carefully selects the independent agencies that represent the Exchange, which seeks to be the lead insurer with its agents in order to enhance the agency relationship and the likelihood of receiving the most desirable underwriting opportunities from its agents. \nThe Exchange’s strategic focus as a reciprocal insurer is to employ a disciplined underwriting philosophy and to leverage its strong surplus position to generate higher risk adjusted investment returns.  The goal is to produce acceptable returns, on a long-term basis, through careful risk selection, appropriate pricing and superior investment returns.  This focus allows the Exchange \n4\nTable of Contents\nto accomplish its mission of providing as near perfect protection, as near perfect service as is humanly possible at the lowest possible cost.\nSee the risk factors related to our dependency on the growth and financial condition of the Exchange in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report for further discussion on competition in the insurance industry.\nHuman Capital Management\nOur human capital management strategy, including initiatives to shape our workforce and workplace, is designed to attract, retain, and develop talent to ensure we are well positioned for the future.  Our partnership with our employees is one of the cornerstones of our success.  \nOur employee value proposition includes a culture that focuses on physical, financial, and emotional well-being.  We strive to maintain a positive employee experience through a continuous listening approach that seeks employee feedback through various mechanisms such as periodic pulse surveys and all-employee forums.  We offer competitive pay with a signature and affordable benefits package including options designed to meet the unique needs of our employees and their families.  Employees have access to an employee assistance plan, mental and emotional well-being resources, emergency child and elder care providers, adoption assistance, and infertility assistance, among others.  In 2024, we were recognized as a Best Employers: Excellence in Health & Well-being by the Business Group on Health for our commitment to advancing employee well-being for the 15\nth\n consecutive year.\n \nWe hold a shared responsibility view of retirement planning whereby we provide tools and resources that employees are expected to use to achieve their retirement goals.  We set ourselves apart by offering both a 401(k) savings plan and a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan.  We encourage a work/life balance for all employees and recognize the need for employee flexibility by offering an allowance of remote work days to use throughout the year.\nAn engaged workforce is necessary for accomplishing organizational objectives and our portfolio of employee experience initiatives demonstrates our commitment to provide employees an engaging environment throughout all stages of their careers.  We offer professional development opportunities that are designed to prepare employees for future career growth.  Employees have access to skills enhancement training and programs as well as a generous tuition reimbursement program for higher education.  We also grow and develop our employees by offering talent mobility opportunities such as expanded leadership experience, job shadowing, cross-training, stretch assignments, and formal career development programs.\nOur employees also share in our values to give back and make a positive difference in their communities.  We offer a volunteer program that provides employees with an allotment of paid hours annually to volunteer with eligible nonprofit organizations.  We also offer a matching gifts program for donations to eligible nonprofit organizations.\nWe recognize the importance of diverse backgrounds and experiences and are committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all employees. \n \nOur recruiting strategy includes access to multiple talent channels.  We work to expand our pool of potential talent to include an array of skills, backgrounds, and experiences.  We also offer a Future Focus internship program that provides opportunities for college students to gain relevant and real-world business experience in the insurance industry as well as an apprentice program to create a bridge for talent from high schools and community colleges into our workforce.  We are also intentional about leveraging talent from the neuro diverse population, engaging individuals to support various enterprise initiatives.  Additionally, we foster an inclusive workplace through the endorsement of nine affinity networks and five business resource groups.  Affinity networks are employee-driven groups designed to foster greater awareness and a culture of inclusion.  Business resource groups address business issues by aligning cross-functional teams of employees to our business strategy, providing a broader approach to problem-solving and innovation.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWorkforce Metrics\nWe used the following human capital metrics as part of managing our business for the years ended December 31: \n2024\n2023\n2022\nWorkforce size\nFull-time \n(1)\n6,715 \n6,481 \n5,970 \nPart-time\n26 \n24 \n23 \nTemporary \n(2)\n60 \n51 \n45 \nTurnover \n(3)\n8.2 \n%\n9.0 \n%\n11.2 \n%\nVoluntary\n4.8 \n%\n4.8 \n%\n6.9 \n%\nRetirements\n2.3 \n%\n2.8 \n%\n3.6 \n%\nAverage tenure \n(4)\n10.6 \n10.4 \n11.7 \n(1)  Includes approximately 50% of employees who provide claims and life insurance management services exclusively for the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries for all periods presented.  The Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries reimburse us monthly for the cost of these services.\n(2)  Temporary employees are hired for short-term work and paid directly by us.\n(3)  Turnover is calculated using the number of employees who exited, divided by the average headcount of the period and represents the percentage of employees who left voluntarily or involuntarily, including retirements.\n(4)  Average tenure is calculated using the total number of years of employment, divided by average headcount of full-time and part-time employees for the period and represents the average number of years employees have been employed with the organization.\nThe largest portion of our turnover continues to be voluntary turnover, excluding retirements, and remains lower than industry benchmark data.  We continue to monitor turnover trends to determine the appropriate actions to ensure we are well positioned for the future.\nGovernment Regulation\nMost states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer.  Indemnity and the Exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system. \nEach insurance company in the holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory authority of its state of domicile and furnish information regarding the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers within the system.  Pursuant to these laws, the respective insurance departments may examine us and the Exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries at any time, and may require disclosure and/or prior approval of certain transactions with the insurers and us, as an insurance holding company.\nAll transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  Approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.  \nWebsite Access\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at \nwww.erieinsurance.com\n as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Additionally, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K are available free of charge, upon written request, by contacting Investor Relations, Erie Indemnity Company,     100 Erie Insurance Place, Erie, PA 16530, or calling (800) 458-0811.\n6\nTable of Contents",

Our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange, as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. \nThe Exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another.  Each applicant for insurance (a subscriber) to the Exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of Indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the Exchange on their behalf.  \nIn accordance with the subscriber’s agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we retain a management fee.  Management fee revenue is based upon all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%.  Our Board of Directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in December for the following year.  The process of setting the management fee rate includes, but is not limited to, the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both Indemnity and the Exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including, but not limited to: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position.  The management fee rate was set at 25% for 2024, 2023 and 2022.  Based on analysis of the foregoing factors, our Board of Directors set the 2025 management fee rate again at 25%.\nOur earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  The policy issuance and renewal services we provide are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies.  The sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services.  Agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as incentive compensation, which is earned by achieving targeted measures.  Agent compensation comprised approximately 69% of our 2024 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 9% of our 2024 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support.  We also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 9% of our 2024 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.\nConsistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions.  Life insurance management services include \n20\nTable of Contents\ncosts incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business.  Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds.  In 2024, approximately 70% of the administrative services expenses were entirely attributable to the respective administrative functions (claims handling, life insurance management and investment management), while the remaining 30% of these expenses were allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions.  The expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity.  Reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.\nOur results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the Exchange as the Exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The Exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 71% of the 2024 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 29%.  The principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  The principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.\nWe generate investment income from our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios.  Our portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.  We actively evaluate the fixed maturity portfolios for securities in an unrealized loss position and record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security.  Impairments resulting from a credit loss are recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nFinancial Overview\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\nOperating income\n$\n676,455 \n30.0 \n%\n$\n520,256 \n38.3 \n%\n$\n376,214 \nTotal investment income\n69,260 \nNM\n28,968 \nNM\n632 \nInterest expense, net\n— \nNM\n— \nNM\n2,009 \nOther income\n11,564 \n(9.0)\n12,712 \nNM\n1,615 \nIncome before income taxes\n757,279 \n34.8 \n561,936 \n49.3 \n376,452 \nIncome tax expense\n156,965 \n35.5 \n115,875 \n48.8 \n77,883 \nNet income\n$\n600,314 \n34.6 \n%\n$\n446,061 \n49.4 \n%\n$\n298,569 \nNet income per share - diluted\n$\n11.48 \n34.6 \n%\n$\n8.53 \n49.4 \n%\n$\n5.71 \nNM = not meaningful\nOperating income increased in 2024 compared to 2023 as growth in operating revenue outpaced the growth in operating expenses.  Management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge and the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The management fee rate was 25% for 2024, 2023, and 2022.  The direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange increased 18.4% to $11.9 billion in 2024 and 17.0% to $10.1 billion in 2023. \nCost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 15.0% to $2.3 billion in 2024 primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, as well as increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs, partially offset by decreased professional fees.  Cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 12.0% to $2.0 billion in 2023 primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, as well as increased employee compensation and technology costs, partially offset by decreased agent incentive compensation driven by higher claims severity and related loss costs experienced by the Exchange. \nManagement fee revenue for administrative services increased 7.4% to $68.4 million in 2024 compared to an increase of 9.2% in 2023.  The administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by $806.3 million in 2024 and $737.1 million in 2023, but had no net impact on operating income.\n21\nTable of Contents\nTotal investment income increased $40.3 million in 2024 primarily due to an increase in net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains in 2024 compared to net realized and unrealized losses in 2023.  Total investment income increased $28.3 million in 2023 primarily due to lower realized and unrealized investment losses and an increase in net investment income compared to 2022.\nGeneral Conditions and Trends Affecting Our Business\nEconomic conditions\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the Exchange’s customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the Exchange, and consequently our management fee revenue.  Elevated inflation or supply chain disruptions could impact the Exchange's operations and our management fees.  In particular, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, building material cost inflation, auto repair and replacement cost inflation, and social inflation may impact adequacy of estimated loss reserves and future premium rates of the Exchange.  If any of these items impacted the financial condition or operations of the Exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results.  See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report for a discussion of potential impacts to our operations or those of the Exchange.\n \nFinancial market volatility\nOur portfolio of fixed maturity and equity security investments is subject to market volatility, especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets.  Net investment income is impacted by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations.  Depending upon market conditions, considerable fluctuation could occur in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  Various ongoing geopolitical events, the uncertain inflationary environment and a potential economic slowdown could have a significant impact on the global financial markets with the potential for future losses and/or impairments on our investment portfolio.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures.  We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations or Financial Position.\nThe following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment.  If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.\nInvestment Valuation\nFair Value Measurements \nWe make estimates concerning the fair value of our investments using valuation techniques to derive the fair value of the fixed maturity and equity investments we hold.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.\nFair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.  Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.  We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  Our investments are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy which assigns a Level 1 for highly observable inputs and a Level 3 to unobservable inputs.  We continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date we re-evaluate their classification in the fair value hierarchy.\nAs of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The presence of at least one unobservable input that has significant impact to the fair value measurement would result in classification as a Level 3 instrument.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on \n22\nTable of Contents\nthe fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions.   While estimates of the fair values of our investment portfolio are obtained from outside pricing services, we ultimately determine whether the inputs used are observable or unobservable.\nAs of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the securities measured at fair value in our investment portfolio are classified as Level 2.  Level 2 securities are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments.  All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  At December 31, 2024, our investments classified as Level 3 were not significant.\nSee Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6, Fair Value, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional details on the fair value measurement of our investments.\nRetirement Benefit Plan for Employees\nOur primary pension plan is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees.  Although we are the sponsor of this postretirement plan and record the funded status of the plan, there are reimbursements between us and the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries for their allocated share of pension income or cost.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Postretirement Benefits, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional details on these reimbursements.\nOur pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  Several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plan.  Key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  We review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, and expected future trends. \nAccumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  We discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits.  Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  The construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated AA or equivalent quality.  Target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  Spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  The present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  A single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value.  The cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 14 years.  This yield curve supported the selection of a 5.87% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2024 and for the 2025 pension expense.  The same methodology was used to develop the 5.34% and 5.67% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the pension income for 2024 and 2023, respectively.  A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $4.6 million, of which our share would be approximately $1.8 million, and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $36.3 million.\nUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  These unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  These amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense.  If actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 13 years.\nThe expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  To determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  The expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls.  The expected long-term rate of return is generally less susceptible to annual revisions as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix.  In 2024, we changed our target asset allocation to reduce investment risk by shifting portfolio assets from equity \n23\nTable of Contents\nsecurities to debt securities.  Based on the current asset allocation and a review of the key factors and expectations of future asset performance as well as the current market environment, the expected return on asset assumption will remain at 7.00% for 2025.  A change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2.9 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which our share would be approximately $1.2 million.\nWe use a four-year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  Under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four-year period.  The market-related asset experience during 2024 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a loss of $72.8 million.  Recognition of this loss will be deferred and recognized over a four-year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology.  Once factored into the market-related asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 13 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.\nWe recognized net pension benefit income of $1.5 million in 2024 primarily driven by higher expected return on assets, partially offset by a lower discount rate, compared to 2023.  We expect to recognize net pension benefit expense of $7.8 million in 2025 primarily driven by anticipated plan progression as well as demographic assumption updates from a 2024 experience study, partially offset by an increase in the discount rate.  Our share of the net pension benefit income after reimbursements was $0.6 million in 2024.  We expect our share of the net pension benefit expense to be approximately $3.1 million in 2025, of which expense of $13.6 million will be recorded in operating expense and income of $10.5 million will be recorded in other income.\nThe actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Postretirement Benefits, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional details on the pension plan.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nManagement fee revenue\nWe have two performance obligations in the subscriber’s agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange, as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.  We retain management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange in these two capacities and allocate our revenues between our performance obligations.\nThe management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our Board of Directors at least annually.  The management fee rate was set at 25% for 2024, 2023 and 2022.  Changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly.  The transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative services reimbursement revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services.  We update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price.  Our current transaction price allocation review resulted in a minor change in the allocation between the two performance obligations in 2024 compared to prior years, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nThe following table presents the allocation and disaggregation of revenue for our two performance obligations: \nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\nPolicy issuance and renewal services\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange\n$\n11,903,759 \n18.4 \n%\n$\n10,056,484 \n17.0 \n%\n$\n8,595,960 \nManagement fee rate\n24.40 \n%\n24.30 \n%\n24.30 \n%\nManagement fee revenue\n2,904,517 \n18.9 \n2,443,726 \n17.0 \n2,088,818 \nChange in estimate for management fee returned on cancelled policies \n(1)\n(10,443)\nNM\n(1,653)\n(70.0)\n(972)\nManagement fee revenue - policy issuance and renewal services\n$\n2,894,074 \n18.5 \n%\n$\n2,442,073 \n17.0 \n%\n$\n2,087,846 \nAdministrative services\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange\n$\n11,903,759 \n18.4 \n%\n$\n10,056,484 \n17.0 \n%\n$\n8,595,960 \nManagement fee rate\n0.60 \n%\n0.70 \n%\n0.70 \n%\nManagement fee revenue\n71,423 \n1.5 \n70,395 \n17.0 \n60,172 \nChange in contract liability \n(2)\n(2,985)\n55.4 \n(6,690)\nNM\n(1,865)\nChange in estimate for management fee returned on cancelled policies \n(1)\n(83)\nNM\n(36)\nNM\n16 \nManagement fee revenue - administrative services\n68,355 \n7.4 \n63,669 \n9.2 \n58,323 \nAdministrative services reimbursement revenue\n806,336 \n9.4 \n737,139 \n10.3 \n668,268 \nTotal revenue from administrative services\n$\n874,691 \n9.2 \n%\n$\n800,808 \n10.2 \n%\n$\n726,591 \n  NM = not meaningful\n(1)    A constraining estimate of variable consideration exists related to the potential for management fees to be returned if a policy were to be cancelled mid-term.

See Item 8. \"Financial Statements - Note 3, Revenue, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report.\n25\nTable of Contents\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the Exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries.  Direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange increased 18.4% to $11.9 billion in 2024, from $10.1 billion in 2023, primarily driven by increased personal lines and commercial multi-peril premiums written.  Year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 4.8% in 2024 as a result of continued strong policyholder retention, compared to 6.9% in 2023.  The year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 13.4% at December 31, 2024 compared to 9.4% at December 31, 2023.\nPremiums generated from new business increased 14.2% to $1.7 billion in 2024.  While year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 16.6% at December 31, 2024, new business policies written decreased 2.1% in 2024.  Premiums generated from new business increased 37.9% to $1.5 billion in 2023.  New business policies written increased 23.7% in 2023 and year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 11.5% at December 31, 2023.\nPremiums generated from renewal business increased 19.1% to $10.2 billion in 2024, and increased 13.9% to $8.5 billion, in 2023.  Underlying the trend in renewal business premiums in both periods were increases in year-over-year average premium per policy of 12.9% at December 31, 2024 and 9.0% at December 31, 2023, as well as an increase in year-over-year policies in force of 6.0% and 4.5% in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Exchange implements rate changes in order to meet loss cost expectations.  In 2022 and continuing through 2024, the Exchange implemented rate increases primarily as a result of inflation-driven severity increases.  As the Exchange writes policies almost exclusively with annual terms, premium rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be recognized in earned premiums.  Since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full.  As a result, certain rate changes approved in 2023 were reflected in 2024, and a portion of the premium rate actions approved in 2024 will be reflected in 2025.  Furthermore, the Exchange writes certain personal auto policies with a rate locking feature, which generally extends the amount of time it takes for premium rate actions to be recognized related to these policies.  The Exchange continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.\nPersonal lines\n – Total personal lines premiums written increased 20.0% to $8.5 billion in 2024, from $7.1 billion in 2023, driven by a 15.1% increase in total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 4.8% increase in total personal lines policies in force. Total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy increased 10.5% at December 31, 2023 and policies in force increased 7.4% in 2023.\nCommercial lines\n – Total commercial lines premiums written increased 14.5% to $3.4 billion in 2024, from $3.0 billion in 2023, driven by a 9.4% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 4.6% increase in total commercial lines policies in force. Total commercial lines premiums written increased 13.0% in 2023, compared to 2022, driven by a 9.5% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 3.2% increase in total commercial lines policies in force.\nFuture trends-premium revenue\n – Through a careful agency selection and monitoring process, the Exchange plans to continue efforts to utilize its agency force to increase market penetration in existing operating territories to contribute to future growth.  \nChanges in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affect the profitability of the Exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee.  Our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of pricing sophistication models have contributed to the Exchange's steady policy retention ratios.  The continued growth of its policy base is dependent upon the Exchange's ability to retain existing and attract new subscribers (policyholders).  A lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the Exchange's premium level growth, and consequently our management fee.\nChanges in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the Exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee.  Pricing actions contemplated or taken by the Exchange are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which it operates.  The pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect on the market competitiveness of the Exchange's insurance products.  Such pricing actions, and those of the Exchange's competitors, could affect the ability of the Exchange's agents to retain and attract new business.  We expect the Exchange's pricing actions in 2024 to result in an increase in direct written premiums in 2025; however, exposure reductions and/or changes in mix of business as a result of economic conditions could impact the average direct and affiliated assumed premium written by the Exchange, as customers may reduce coverages.\n26\nTable of Contents\nPolicy issuance and renewal services\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\nManagement fee revenue - policy issuance and renewal services\n$\n2,894,074 \n18.5 \n%\n$\n2,442,073 \n17.0 \n%\n$\n2,087,846 \nService agreement revenue\n26,350 \n1.1 \n26,059 \n1.4 \n25,687 \n2,920,424 \n18.3 \n2,468,132 \n16.8 \n2,113,533 \nCost of operations - policy issuance and renewal services\n2,312,324 \n15.0 \n2,011,545 \n12.0 \n1,795,642 \nOperating income - policy issuance and renewal services\n$\n608,100 \n33.2 \n%\n$\n456,587 \n43.6 \n%\n$\n317,891 \nPolicy issuance and renewal services\nThe management fee revenue allocated for providing policy issuance and renewal services was 24.40% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange in 2024 and 24.30% in both 2023 and 2022.  This portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue when the policy is issued or renewed because it is at that time that the services we provide are substantially complete and the executed insurance policy is transferred to the customer.  The increase in management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services was driven by the increase in the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange discussed previously.\nService agreement revenue\nService agreement revenue primarily consists of service charges we collect from subscribers (policyholders) for providing multiple payment plans on policies written by the Exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries and also includes late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  The service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment.  Service agreement revenue also includes fees received from the Exchange for the use of shared office space.\nCost of policy issuance and renewal services\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\nCommissions:\nTotal commissions\n$\n1,601,401 \n18.8 \n%\n$\n1,348,530 \n14.3 \n%\n$\n1,179,569 \nNon-commission expense:\nUnderwriting and policy processing\n$\n199,485 \n10.2 \n%\n$\n181,003 \n5.5 \n%\n$\n171,625 \nInformation technology\n215,488 \n(0.6)\n216,746 \n9.4 \n198,157 \nSales and advertising\n66,480 \n12.9 \n58,905 \n(1.8)\n60,000 \nCustomer service\n43,045 \n25.2 \n34,391 \n0.2 \n34,333 \nAdministrative and other\n186,425 \n8.4 \n171,970 \n13.2 \n151,958 \nTotal non-commission expense\n710,923 \n7.2 \n663,015 \n7.6 \n616,073 \nTotal cost of operations - policy issuance and renewal services\n$\n2,312,324 \n15.0 \n%\n$\n2,011,545 \n12.0 \n%\n$\n1,795,642 \nCommissions\n – Commissions increased $252.9 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium.  Commissions increased $169.0 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by the growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation.  The profitability component of agent incentive compensation decreased due to higher claims severity and related loss costs in the three-year period ended 2023 compared to the three-year period ended 2022.\nNon-commission expense\n – Non-commission expense increased $47.9 million in 2024 compared to 2023.  Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $18.5 million primarily due to increased underwriting report and personnel costs.  Information technology costs decreased $1.3 million primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and personnel costs, partially offset by an increase in hardware and software costs.  Sales and advertising expense increased $7.6 million primarily due to increased agent-related costs and costs from community development initiatives.  Customer service costs increased $8.7 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and credit card processing fees.  Administrative and other costs increased \n27\nTable of Contents\n$14.5 million primarily due to increased personnel costs, charitable contributions and professional fees.  Personnel costs in 2024 were impacted by increased compensation.\nIn 2023, non-commission expense increased $46.9 million compared to 2022.  Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $9.4 million primarily due to policies in force growth.  Information technology costs increased $18.6 million primarily due to increased professional fees, personnel costs, and hardware and software costs.  Administrative and other costs increased $20.0 million primarily due to an increase in personnel costs.  Personnel costs in 2023 were impacted by increased compensation including higher estimated costs for incentive plan awards, partially offset by lower pension costs due to an increase in the discount rate compared to 2022. Increases in incentive plan costs were driven by improved direct written premium and policies in force growth and Indemnity's higher stock price at year-end 2023 compared to 2022.\nAdministrative services\nYears ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\nManagement fee revenue - administrative services\n$\n68,355 \n7.4 \n%\n$\n63,669 \n9.2 \n%\n$\n58,323 \nAdministrative services reimbursement revenue\n806,336 \n9.4 \n737,139 \n10.3 \n668,268 \nTotal revenue allocated to administrative services\n874,691 \n9.2 \n800,808 \n10.2 \n726,591 \nAdministrative services expenses\nClaims handling services\n690,662 \n8.8 \n635,043 \n10.1 \n576,799 \nInvestment management services\n34,889 \n(0.2)\n34,958 \n(5.0)\n36,795 \nLife management services\n80,785 \n20.3 \n67,138 \n22.8 \n54,674 \nOperating income - administrative services\n$\n68,355 \n7.4 \n%\n$\n63,669 \n9.2 \n%\n$\n58,323 \n \nAdministrative services\nThe management fee revenue allocated to administrative services was 0.60% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange in 2024 and 0.70% in both 2023 and 2022.  This portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue over a four-year period representing the time over which the services are provided.  We also report reimbursed costs as revenues, which are recognized monthly as services are provided.  The administrative services expenses we incur and the related reimbursements we receive are recorded gross in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCost of administrative services\nConsistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity. Reimbursements due from the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries are recorded as a receivable and settled at cost.\n28\nTable of Contents\nTotal investment income\nA summary of the results of our investment operations is as follows for the years ended December 31:\n \n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\nNet investment income\n$\n70,155 \n57.4 \n%\n$\n44,572 \n55.9 \n%\n$\n28,585 \nNet realized and unrealized investment gains (losses)\n3,229 \nNM\n(5,838)\n78.6 \n(27,286)\nNet impairment losses recognized in earnings\n(4,124)\n57.8 \n(9,766)\nNM\n(667)\nTotal investment income\n$\n69,260 \nNM\n%\n$\n28,968 \nNM\n%\n$\n632 \nNM = not meaningful\nNet investment income\nNet investment income includes interest and dividends on our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios and the results of our limited partnership investments, net of investment expenses.

The strength of the Exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by A.M. Best through assessing its financial stability and ability to pay claims.  The ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors.  The Exchange and each of its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are rated A+ \"Superior\", the second highest financial strength rating, which is assigned to companies that have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by A.M. Best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term.  As of December 31, 2024, only approximately 13% of insurance groups, in which the Exchange is included, are rated A+ or higher.  On August 8, 2024, while our A+ \"Superior\" rating was reaffirmed, the financial strength rating outlook was revised from stable to negative.  The outlook was primarily driven by the Exchange’s recent profitability challenges from rising loss cost pressures and increased weather-related activity, and the related surplus impact.  The outlook acknowledged that while actions have been implemented to address the challenges, the timing lag related to the most significant action, rate increases, could result in interim challenges until such time as the rate increases are earned and the full beneficial impact is realized.\nThe financial statements of the Exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Statutory direct written premiums of the Exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries grew 18.4% to $11.9 billion in 2024 from $10.1 billion in 2023.  These premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the Exchange.  Policyholders' surplus, determined under statutory accounting principles, was $9.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.  The Exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 90.4% at December 31, 2024 and 91.2% at December 31, 2023.\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements considering the financial strength of the Exchange based on its A.M. Best rating and strong level of surplus.  See Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for possible outcomes that could impact that determination.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestments\nOur investment portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.  The following table presents the carrying value of our investments as of December 31:\n \n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n% to total\n2023\n% to total\nAvailable-for-sale securities \n(1)\n$\n1,043,615 \n83 \n%\n$\n961,241 \n85 \n%\nEquity securities\n85,891 \n7 \n84,253 \n7 \nAgent loans \n(2)\n92,731 \n7 \n67,787 \n6 \nOther investments \n(3)\n29,610 \n3 \n23,026 \n2 \n Total investments\n$\n1,251,847 \n100 \n%\n$\n1,136,307 \n100 \n%\n(1)\nThis includes $7.3 million of securities lent under a securities lending agreement.\n(2)\nThe current portion of agent loans is included in the line item \"Prepaid expenses and other current assets, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n(3)\nThe current and long-term portions of other investments are included in the line items \"Prepaid expenses and other current assets, net\" and \"Other assets, net\", respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nWe continually review our investment portfolio for impairment and determine whether the impairment is a result of credit loss or other factors.  We analyze all positions with an emphasis on those in a significant unrealized loss position.  If we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings.  Factors considered in the evaluation of credit loss include the extent to which fair value is less than cost and fundamental factors specific to the issuer such as financial condition, changes in credit ratings, near and long-term business prospects and other factors, as well as the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost of the security.  Impairment resulting from credit loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  We believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of fair value and recognition of impairment.\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nUnder our investment strategy, we maintain an available-for-sale portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector.  This investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule.  Our available-for-sale portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.  \nAvailable-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity.  Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, net of deferred taxes, totaled $17.6 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $24.7 million at December 31, 2023.  Our evaluation of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance included available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, if necessary, to support the realizability of deferred tax assets.  We believe those tax strategies are feasible and prudent.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the fair value of our available-for-sale portfolio by industry sector and rating as of December 31, 2024: \n(1)\n(in thousands)\nAAA\nAA\nA\nBBB\nNon-investment\ngrade\nFair\nvalue\nBasic materials\n$\n0 \n$\n0 \n$\n961 \n$\n2,156 \n$\n8,809 \n$\n11,926 \nCommunications\n0 \n5,967 \n12,615 \n14,030 \n11,882 \n44,494 \nConsumer\n0 \n1,976 \n32,822 \n63,195 \n42,072 \n140,065 \nDiversified\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n679 \n679 \nEnergy\n0 \n849 \n5,720 \n17,003 \n14,326 \n37,898 \nFinancial\n0 \n6,303 \n103,826 \n134,849 \n20,307 \n265,285 \nIndustrial\n0 \n0 \n5,367 \n18,315 \n27,943 \n51,625 \nStructured securities \n(2)\n \n163,273 \n183,706 \n28,095 \n17,146 \n844 \n393,064 \nTechnology\n1,941 \n0 \n0 \n19,389 \n14,202 \n35,532 \nUtilities\n0 \n0 \n11,022 \n40,907 \n11,118 \n63,047 \nTotal\n$\n165,214 \n$\n198,801 \n$\n200,428 \n$\n326,990 \n$\n152,182 \n$\n1,043,615 \n(1)    \n \nRatings are supplied by S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch . The table is based upon the lowest rating for each security.\n(2)    Structured securities include residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and asset-backed securities.\nEquity securities\nEquity securities primarily include nonredeemable preferred stocks and are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position with all changes in unrealized gains and losses reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe following table presents an analysis of the fair value of our equity securities by sector as of December 31:\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nFinancial services\n$\n69,930 \n$\n69,900 \nUtilities\n5,629 \n5,810 \nEnergy\n4,117 \n3,901 \nConsumer\n3,341 \n3,915 \nTechnology\n1,974 \n500 \nIndustrial\n0 \n180 \nCommunications\n900 \n47 \nTotal \n$\n85,891 \n$\n84,253 \nShareholders' Equity\nPostretirement benefit plans\nThe funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.  At December 31, 2024, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans decreased by $41.3 million, net of tax, of which $5.2 million primarily represents amortization of net actuarial gain and $36.1 million primarily represents the current period actuarial loss.  The 2024 actuarial loss was driven primarily by the lower than expected return on plan assets, partially offset by the higher discount rate used to measure the future benefit obligations.  At December 31, 2023, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans decreased by $33.8 million, net of tax, of which $11.0 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial gain and $22.8 million primarily represents the current period actuarial loss.  The 2023 actuarial loss was driven by the lower discount rate used to measure the future benefit obligations, partially offset by higher than expected return on plan assets.  Although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, there are reimbursements between us and the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries for their allocated share of pension income or cost.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Postretirement Benefits, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional details on these reimbursements.\n32\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe continue to monitor the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources given the potential impact of current economic\nconditions, including the uncertain inflationary and interest rate environment.  While we did not see a significant impact on our sources or uses of cash in 2024, future market disruptions could occur which may affect our liquidity position.  If our normal operating and investing cash activities were to become insufficient to meet future funding requirements, we believe we have sufficient access to liquidity through our cash position, diverse liquid marketable securities, and our $100 million bank revolving line of credit that does not expire until November 1, 2029.  See broader discussions of potential risks to our operations in Operating Overview and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report. \nSources and Uses of Cash\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  Our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  Cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, the purchase and development of information technology, and other capital expenditures.  We expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations.  Cash in excess of our operating needs is primarily invested in investment grade fixed maturities.  As part of our liquidity review, we regularly evaluate our capital needs based on current and projected results and consider the potential impacts to our liquidity, borrowing capacity, financial covenants and capital availability. \nWe have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various agreements.  Cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current obligations. \nOur long-term cash requirements under various contractual obligations and commitments include: \n•\nPension\n – We have a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded SERP for certain members of executive and senior management.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Postretirement Benefits, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for the funding policy and related contributions for our defined benefit pension plan, and accumulated benefit obligation for our unfunded SERP.\n•\nDeferred compensation\n – We have two deferred compensation plans for our executives, senior vice presidents and other selected officers, and two deferred compensation plans for our outside directors.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11, Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plans, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional details of these obligations and estimated future payments. \n•\nHome office renovations\n – We have agreements with external contracting firms for renovations to an office building that is part of our principal headquarters.  Remaining commitments related to the underlying contracts total $45.4 million at December 31, 2024, of which over half is due in the next 12 months.  Additional contracts will be executed as we begin each new phase of the overall renovation project and will be funded using our working capital.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8, Fixed Assets, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional details on construction in progress costs and expected completion date.\n•\nOther commitments\n – We have commitments for approximately $460 million which include agreements for various services, including information technology, support and maintenance obligations, operating leases for equipment, vehicles and real estate, and other obligations in the ordinary course of business.  We expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms.  These agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify fixed amounts or minimum quantities to be purchased.  Some agreements may contain cancellation provisions, some of which may require us to pay a termination fee.  Over half of these commitments are due in the next 12 months.  We are reimbursed from the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries for the portion of these costs related to administrative services.\nWe maintain relationships and cash balances at diversified and well-capitalized financial institutions and have established processes to monitor them.  We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our current and future cash requirements.\nVolatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  Some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, may be illiquid.  Additionally, if we require\nsignificant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements, or if we are required to return cash\n33\nTable of Contents\ncollateral in connection with our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, or\nbe forced to sell at deep discounts.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from sources other than the liquidation of securities.\nCash flow activities\nThe following table provides condensed cash flow information for the years ended December 31:\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n611,249 \n$\n381,205 \n$\n366,152 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(226,912)\n(157,565)\n(106,922)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(229,995)\n(221,675)\n(300,842)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n154,342 \n$\n1,965 \n$\n(41,612)\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $611.2 million in 2024, compared to $381.2 million in 2023 and $366.2 million in 2022.  Increased cash provided by operating activities in 2024, compared to 2023, was primarily due to an increase in management fees received of $478.2 million driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange, a decrease in pension and employee benefits paid of $59.0 million due to lower pension contributions, and a decrease in incentive compensation paid to agents of $25.3 million.  Pension contributions totaled $33.0 million in 2024 compared to $95.0 million in 2023.  This was partially offset by increases in cash paid for agent commissions of $243.3 million driven by premium growth and income taxes paid of $55.5 million.  Increased cash provided by operating activities in 2023, compared to 2022, was primarily due to an increase in management fees received of $319.2 million driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  This was partially offset by increases in cash paid for agent commissions of $157.9 million driven by premium growth, pension and employee benefits paid of $101.3 million primarily due to higher pension contributions, and general operating expenses paid of $30.3 million primarily driven by higher information technology-related professional fees and hardware and software costs.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $226.9 million in 2024, compared to $157.6 million in 2023 and $106.9 million in 2022.  In 2024, 2023 and 2022, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by fixed asset purchases of $124.8 million, $92.6 million and $67.2 million, respectively, mostly related to software and home office renovations.  Additionally, purchases of investments exceeded proceeds generated from sales and maturities/calls of investments in all periods, while 2024 and 2023 also included loans issued to fund real estate development projects supporting revitalization efforts in our community.  \nNet cash used in financing activities was $230.0 million in 2024, compared to $221.7 million in 2023 and $300.8 million in 2022 primarily due to dividends paid to shareholders.  While we increased both our Class A and Class B shareholder regular quarterly dividends by 7.1% in 2024 and 7.2% in 2023, the change in net cash used related to financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the repayment of the remaining $93.2 million balance on the term loan in 2022.  \nCapital Outlook\nWe regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events, including under current inflationary conditions and a higher interest rate environment.  Should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.\nOutside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through: 1) unrestricted and unpledged cash and cash equivalents, which totaled approximately $271.0 million at December 31, 2024, 2) $100 million available bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unrestricted and unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including equity securities and investment grade bonds, which totaled approximately $849.8 million at December 31, 2024.  Volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  Additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9, Bank Line of Credit, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional information related to our bank revolving line of credit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional information.  We do not believe that these obligations will have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n34\nTable of Contents\nEnterprise Risk Management\nThe role of our Enterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders.  Our ERM program views risk holistically across all our companies and facilitates implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts.  See Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained in this report for a list of risk factors.\nOur ERM process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our Board of Directors and executive management.  Accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business.  We establish risk tolerance ranges to monitor and manage significant risks.  In addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our ERM process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing.  Given our defined tolerance for risk, risk model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity levels.\nTRANSACTIONS/AGREEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nBoard Oversight\nOur Board of Directors has a broad oversight responsibility over our intercompany relationships with the Exchange.  Thus, our Board of Directors may be required to make decisions or take actions that may benefit subscribers at the Exchange and the overall health of the Exchange.  These actions may ultimately benefit our shareholders.\nInsurance Holding Company System\nMost states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer.  The Exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries:  Erie Insurance Company, Erie Insurance Company of New York, Erie Insurance Property & Casualty Company and Flagship City Insurance Company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, Erie Family Life Insurance Company.  Indemnity and the Exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.  \nTransactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  Approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of certain transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.\nIntercompany Agreements\nSubscriber's and services agreements\nWe serve as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  Each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange (a subscriber) signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  Through the designation of attorney-in-fact, we are required to provide policy issuance and renewal services and act as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  In accordance with the subscriber's agreement, we retain a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  Consistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for all administrative services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity.  Reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.\nShared facilities\nThe Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries have a service agreement with Indemnity to use space in Indemnity-owned properties.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15, Related Party, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional details. \nCost Allocation\nThe allocation of costs affects our consolidated financial condition and that of the Exchange and its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries.  Management's role is to determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the Exchange, intercompany service agreements, and applicable insurance laws and regulations.  Allocation of costs under these various agreements requires judgment and interpretation by Indemnity, and such \n35\nTable of Contents\nallocations are performed using a consistent methodology, which is intended to adhere to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements.\nIntercompany Receivables\nWe have significant receivables from the Exchange and its affiliates that result in a concentration of credit risk.  Net receivables from the Exchange and other affiliates were $707.1 million, or 24.5% of total assets, at December 31, 2024 and $625.3 million, or 25.3% of total assets, at December 31, 2023.  These receivables include management fees due for policy issuance and renewal services performed by us under the subscriber's agreement, and certain costs we incur acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  These receivables from the Exchange and other affiliates are settled monthly.  We continually monitor the financial strength of the Exchange.  \nOther Loans Receivable\nIn 2023, we issued two senior secured loans totaling $13.6 million to fund a real estate development project supporting revitalization efforts in our community.  Ownership in the project includes related party and unrelated investors.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15,  Related Party, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional details.",
