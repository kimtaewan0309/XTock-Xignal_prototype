  "item1": "Item 1. Business.\nGeneral\nMondelēz International’s purpose is to empower people to snack right. We sell our products in over\n 150 c\nountries around the world. \nWe are one of the world’s largest snack companies with global net revenues of $36.4 billion and net earnings of $4.6 billion in 2024. Our core business is making and selling chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks. We also have additional businesses in adjacent, locally relevant categories including gum & candy, cheese & grocery and powdered beverages. Our portfolio includes iconic global and local brands such as \nOreo, Ritz, LU, Clif Bar \nand \nTate’s Bake Shop \nbiscuits and baked snacks, as well as \nCadbury Dairy Milk, Milka\n and \nToblerone\n chocolate.\nWe strive to create a positive impact on the world and communities in which we operate while driving business performance. Our goal is to lead the future of snacking around the world by offering the right snack, for the right moment, made the right way. We aim to deliver a broad range of delicious, high-quality snacks that nourish life’s moments, made with sustainable ingredients and packaging.\nStrategy\nWe aim to be the global leader in snacking by focusing on growth, execution, culture and sustainability. We are optimizing our portfolio of leading brands and have refined our strategy to accelerate growth, prioritizing our fast-growing core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks. Our strategic plan builds on our strong foundations, including leadership in attractive categories, an attractive global footprint, a strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution and cost excellence capabilities and top talent with a growth mindset.\nOur plan to drive long-term growth includes four strategic priorities: \n•\nAccelerate consumer-centric growth. \nOur consumers are the reason we want to be the best snacking company in the world, and we put them at the heart of everything we do. With our consumers in mind, we are focused on accelerating and increasing our focus on chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks by investing in both our global and local brands. We are working to deliver multi-category growth in key geographies, expand our presence in high growth channels and increase our presence in under-represented segments and price tiers. As demands on consumers’ time increase and consumer eating habits evolve, we aim to meet consumers' snacking needs. We plan to test, learn and scale new product offerings quickly to meet diverse and evolving local and global snacking demand. \n•\nDrive operational excellence. \nOur operational excellence and continuous improvement plans include a special focus on the consumer-facing areas of our business and optimizing our sales, marketing and customer service efforts. To drive productivity gains and cost improvements across our business, we also plan to continue leveraging our global shared services platform, driving greater efficiencies in our supply chain informed by a consumer-centric approach and applying strong cost discipline across our operations. We expect the improvements and efficiencies we drive will fuel our growth and continue to expand profit dollars. We are also focused on boosting digital commerce and on our digital transformation program that will help us to meet consumer demand and generate incremental sales opportunities.\n•\nBuild a winning growth culture. \nTo support the acceleration of our growth, we are becoming more agile, digital and local-consumer focused. We are committed to investing in a diverse and talented workforce that helps our business move forward with greater speed and agility along with future-forward growth capabilities. We empower our local teams to innovate and deliver consumers’ snacking needs while continuing to leverage our global scale to efficiently support our growth strategy. We have given our local teams more autonomy to drive commercial and innovation plans as they are closer to the needs and desires of consumers. We will continue to leverage the efficiency and scale of our regional operating units while empowering our local and commercial operations to respond faster to changing consumer preferences and capitalize on growth opportunities. We believe our efforts  to continue advancing a winning growth culture will help drive profitable top-line growth. \n3\n \nTable of Contents\n•\nScale sustainable snacking\n. We continue to focus significant efforts to drive progress against our core initiatives for more sustainable and mindful snacking. We have a clear strategic approach to focus on the areas where we believe we can drive the most impact with a sustainable snacking strategy, with environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) goals and initiatives that include significant involvement and oversight by our leadership and Board of Directors. This includes ongoing efforts to sustainably source key ingredients, reduce our end-to-end environmental impact and innovate our processes and packaging to reduce waste and promote recycling. Please see our \nSustainability and Mindful Snacking\n section below. \nWe run our business with a long-term perspective and we believe the successful delivery of our strategic plan will drive consistent top- and bottom-line growth and enable us to create long-term value for our shareholders.\nGlobal Operations \nWe sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, including 147 principal manufacturing and processing facilities across 46 countries. The portion of our net revenues generated outside the United States was 74.0% in 2024, 73.4% in 2023 and 73.6% in 2022. For more information on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, refer to Note 18, \nSegment Reporting;\n on our manufacturing and other facilities, refer to Item 2, \nProperties\n; and on risks related to our operations outside the United States, see Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n.\nWe also monitor our revenue growth across emerging markets and developed markets:\n•\nOur emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the Asia, Middle East and Africa (“AMEA”) region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. \n•\nOur developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.\nReportable Segments\nOur operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments:\n•\nLatin America\n•\nAMEA\n•\nEurope\n•\nNorth America\nWe manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. \nPlease see Note 18, \nSegment Reporting and Management’s\n \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\n \nand Results of Operations\n for additional information.\nProduct Categories\nOur brands span five product categories:\n•\nBiscuits & Baked Snacks (including cookies, crackers, salted snacks, snack bars and cakes & pastries)\n•\nChocolate\n•\nGum & candy\n•\nBeverages\n•\nCheese & grocery\nSeasonality\nDemand for our products is generally balanced throughout the year, with increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events. Depending on the timing of Easter, the holiday sales may shift between and affect net revenue in the first and second quarter. \n4\nTable of Contents\nCustomers\nWe generally sell our products to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. We also sell products directly to businesses and consumers through various pure play e-retail platforms, retailer digital platforms, our direct-to-consumer websites and social media platforms. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2024. For a discussion of long-term demographics, consumer trends and demand, refer to our \nFinancial Outlook\n within \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nDistribution and Marketing\nOur product distribution network encompasses direct store delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers, third party distributors and other facilities. Additionally, we leverage the services of independent sales offices and agents in various international locations. Through our global digital commerce organization and capabilities, we pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world, including both pure e-tailers and omni-channel retailers. We continue to invest in advertising and consumer promotions, talent and digital capabilities. Our digital commerce channel strategies play a critical role in our ambition to be the global leader in snacking.\nOur marketing initiatives are categorized in three principal sets of activities: (i) consumer marketing and advertising including digital and social media, on-air, print, outdoor and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers.\nResearch, Development and Innovation\nOur innovation and new product development objectives include continuous improvement in food safety and quality, growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced production costs. We have established a robust framework for innovation to drive a technology pipeline supporting the creation of new product bundles across short-, medium- and long-term horizons. These bundles enhance our portfolio to address evolving consumer preferences and market trends, nutritional needs as well as reduce our environmental impact. We work to test and learn new ideas and implement successful ones into other areas of our business. To drive growth, creativity, greater effectiveness, improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery, we are focusing our technical research and development resources at technical centers around the globe.\nMindful snacking and sustainability are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives. We work to introduce new varieties of our core products, including new taste or nutrition profiles that cater to evolving consumer preferences, such as the launch in the UK of \nCadbury Dairy Milk & MORE\n, a multi-dimensional tablet designed to deliver a richer, more indulgent eating experience, zero-sugar \nOreo’s\n in China and reduced sugar candies under \nThe Natural Confectionary Company\n brand in Australia. We continue to expand our portfolio of cakes and pastries in new markets and with updated formats including \nMilka \nbrownies\n a\nnd \nOreo \ncakes\n.\n \nWe also have a dedicated innovation and venture hub, SnackFutures, specifically tailored to leverage emerging consumer trends and growth opportunities in mindful snacking. The core objectives of this group are aligned with three key strategic areas: invent new brands and businesses, invest in early-stage entrepreneurs and amplify SnackFutures’ influence through the CoLab start-up engagement and mentoring programs built to equip start-ups with essential tools, technologies and expertise that can help them learn, grow and succeed.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive markets that are comprised of global, regional and local competitors, including new start-up brands and businesses. Some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions differently. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, nutritional value, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of our digital and other sales and marketing strategies, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activities and price. Our advantaged global footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we \n5\nTable of Contents\nfocus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a local-first commercial focus with a broad array of product formats, pack sizes and price points, new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives, product innovation and high standards of product quality. We also continue to optimize our manufacturing and supply chain networks and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.\nRaw Materials and Packaging\nWe purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, edible oils, sugar and other sweeteners, flavoring agents and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can sustainably and cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production.\nA number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic environment, including global inflation and the effects of geopolitical uncertainty, climate and weather conditions, trade and regulatory uncertainty, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, supply chain disruptions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.\nFor additional information, refer to \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nand \nCommodity Trends\n.\nHuman Capital\n \nWe believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a purpose-led, global company. All our employees contribute to our success and help us drive strong financial performance. \nAttracting, developing and retaining global talent with the right skills to drive our business is central to our purpose, mission and long-term growth strategy.\nWorkforce Profile\n: At December 31, 2024, we had approximately 90,000 employees. At December 31, 2024, we had approximately 12,000 U.S. employees and approximately 78,000 employees outside the United States, with employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils representing approximately 20% of our U.S. employees and approximately 60% of our employees outside the United States. \nWorkplace Safety and Wellness\n: We promote a strong culture of safety and prioritize keeping all our employees, contractors and visitors safe. To accomplish this, we employ comprehensive health, safety and environment management policies and standards throughout the organization. In addition, we strive to continuously improve our work processes, tools and metrics to mitigate and prevent workplace injuries and enhance safety.\nWe remain committed to providing a modern and flexible approach to how and where we work. Our hybrid work model allows our office-based employees to engage with colleagues, customers and suppliers in-person on a regular basis while also leveraging innovative technology to optimize collaboration across geographically dispersed teams.\nTalent Management and Development:\n Maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our ongoing success and to our succession planning efforts across the organization. Our leadership and people teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. \nSpecifically, we review strategic positions regularly and identify potential internal candidates to fill those roles, evaluating job skill sets to identify competency gaps and creating developmental plans to facilitate employee professional growth. We believe in supporting a healthy balance between development and advancement of internal talent and infusion of new talent and capabilities to enhance our teams.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe invest in our employees through training and development programs, on the job experiences, coaching, as well as tuition reimbursement, for a majority of our employees in the United States to promote continued professional growth. We provide access to technical and leadership development programs to enable colleagues to grow skills and capabilities to become more successful. We also have dedicated talent programs that support and accelerate leadership development and strengthen our succession plans. We have expanded and increased global participation in our Talent Marketplace, a development solution that helps connect employees to short-term ‘gig’ opportunities. Additionally, coaching, mentoring and team-based development solutions are provided to colleagues across all levels to support leadership, team effectiveness and performance. \nCulture and Employee Engagement:\n We believe that a diverse workforce with a range of experiences and perspectives is a significant driver of sustainable innovation and growth. We continue to focus on creating an inclusive culture for employees, providing all employees with opportunities through our development programs and policies. We believe a culture where employees feel heard and managers take action is key to building a highly-engaged workforce that can deliver sustainable business growth. We conduct confidential engagement surveys of our global workforce annually that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party. Aggregate survey results include external benchmark comparisons and are reviewed by executive officers and the Board of Directors. Based on the results, we create action plans at global, regional, functional and managerial levels. By acting on results both at an aggregate enterprise level and a department/business/work group level, we have been able to enhance our culture and improve our overall engagement. \nTotal Rewards\n: As part of our total rewards philosophy, we offer competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and talent strategy as well as drive a strong connection between the contributions of our employees and their pay. We believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. Further, to foster a strong sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, we grant stock-based incentives to most senior-level employees.\nWe also continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees’ health and wellness needs. We provide access to medical and welfare benefits and offer programs to all employees that support work-life balance, including paid parental leave, as well as financial, physical and mental health resources, including employee assistance programs that reach all global colleagues.\nWe are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors such as an employee’s role and experience, job location and performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay.\n \nWith the support of an independent third-party expert in this field, we conduct global pay equity reviews for salaried employees based on gender and, in the United States, race (as permitted by local country law). Our last global analysis in 2024 encompassed 82 countries and over 36,000 employees. From this analysis, our pay gap between male and female employees was less than 1% when performing substantially similar work at Mondelēz. In the United States, we also review pay for salaried employees in the same pay grade by race/ethnicity (Asian, Black and Hispanic). The 2024 independent analysis found no systemic issues and no negative pay gap between non-white and white employees when performing substantially similar work at Mondelēz.\nSustainability and Mindful Snacking \nSnacking Made Right is the lens through which we determine our ESG priorities to deliver on our mission of leading the future of snacking by offering the right snack, for the right moment, made the right way. We have a clear strategic approach to making snacking right, so we can drive innovative, more sustainable business growth.\nWe focus in key areas where we believe we can deliver greater long-term positive impact. Our strategy and goals in these key focus areas are central to supporting our growth around the world and underpinned by our focus on promoting a culture of safety, quality and inclusivity. Our goals include more sustainable sourcing of key ingredients, reducing our environmental footprint, promoting the rights of people across our value chain, and evolving our portfolio to offer a broader range of high-quality snacks addressing consumer needs while encouraging consumers to snack mindfully. In 2024, we made progress against these goals, such as receiving validation for our 2030 near-\n7\nTable of Contents\nterm and 2050 long-term Net Zero goal from \nthe Science Based Targets Initiative and continuing to increase the ratio of renewable energy used within several of our owned manufacturing facilities across the world.\nThe Governance, Membership and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our ESG policies and programs related to corporate citizenship, social responsibility, and public policy issues significant to us such as sustainability and environmental responsibility; food labeling, marketing and packaging; philanthropic and political activities and contributions; and Board of Directors’ ESG education and capabilities. The People and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our human capital priorities, as well as workplace safety and employee wellness, pay equity, talent sourcing strategies, talent management and development programs and KPIs for incentive plans. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our safety priorities, goals and performance, as well as our ESG-related disclosure in SEC filings, including controls and assurance. Our ESG goals are part of our risk and strategic planning processes and are also embedded across our organization and within our annual incentive compensation program for our leadership. Business leadership teams and our Board of Directors regularly review progress toward these programs and priorities.\nWe discuss our ESG goals and programs in detail in our annual Snacking Made Right report available on our website. We also publish an ESG disclosure data sheet and are aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures reporting frameworks. We also provide our annual CDP Climate Change, Water Security and Forests disclosure.\nIntellectual Property\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business in 2012.\nRegulation\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational laws and regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to the development of differences in government rules across jurisdictions. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include, without limitation, workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes; data privacy and cybersecurity; ingredients, products, processing or other food-related \n8\nTable of Contents\nrestrictions, labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions; export controls on sales or sourcing of raw materials; cross-border trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and packaging taxes. In addition, many Member States in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility (“EPR”) policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. In addition, the European Union has adopted its Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. EPR policies are being implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the United States. Single-use plastic bans or plastic taxes are being implemented or considered in Europe as well as countries in Southeast Asia.\nThroughout the countries in which we do business, we are subject to local, national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. We are also subject to legislation designed to reduce emissions from greenhouse gases, and many countries are considering introducing carbon taxes that could increase our production costs or those of our suppliers.\nWe continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations.

We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our attractive global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution and cost excellence capabilities, and top talent with a growth mindset, will drive consistent top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. \nFor more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, \nBusiness.\nRecent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability\nMacroeconomic environment\nWe continue to observe significant market and geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating consumer demand, inflationary pressures, supply constraints, trade and regulatory uncertainty and exchange rate volatility. As a result, we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, labor and energy costs that have continued to rise. In particular, we expect to continue to face higher cocoa costs, as the market price for cocoa beans has increased significantly year-over-year and it is likely that prices will remain elevated for some time. Refer to \nCommodity Trends\n for additional information.\nOur overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong; however, we anticipate ongoing volatility. We will continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving global economic environment, related uncertainty and business risks while also prioritizing and supporting our employees and customers. We continue to take steps to mitigate impacts to our supply chain, operations, technology and assets.\nAdditionally, we provide more information on risks related to trade and regulatory uncertainty in our \nFinancial Outlook\n section and under Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n.\nWar in Ukraine\nIn February 2022, following the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, we stopped production and closed our facilities in Ukraine; since then we have taken steps to protect the safety of our employees and to restore operations at our two manufacturing facilities, which were significantly damaged in March 2022. See Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n - \nWar in Ukraine, \nto the consolidated financial statements, and refer to \nItems Affecting Comparability of Financial Results\n for additional information.\nWe have suspended new capital investments and our advertising spending in Russia, but as a food company with more than 2,500 employees in the country, we have not ceased operations given we believe we play a role in the continuity of the food supply. We continue to evaluate the situation in Ukraine and Russia and our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis and comply with applicable international sanctions. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries. During both 2024 and 2023, Ukraine generated 0.4% and Russia generated 2.9% of consolidated net revenue. The profitability of and the assets held by our Russian business continue to remain above historic levels. We cannot predict if the recent strength in our Russian business will continue in the future.\nOur operations in Russia are subject to risks, including the temporary or permanent loss of assets due to expropriation or further curtailment of our ability to conduct business operations in Russia. In the event this were to \n32\nTable of Contents\noccur, this could lead to the partial or full impairment of our Russian assets or deconsolidation of the operations in Russia in future periods, or the termination of and loss of revenue from our business operations, based on actions taken by Russia, other parties or us. For additional information, see Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, including the risk entitled “\nThe war in Ukraine has impacted and could continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\n”\nDevelopments in the Middle East\nIn October 2023, conflict developed in the Middle East between Hamas and Israel, and has expanded to other parts of the region. During 2024, we experienced sales impacts related to this conflict in certain AMEA markets, but this did not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We continue to evaluate the impacts of these developments on our business and we cannot predict if it will have a significant impact in the future.\nERP System Implementation\nIn July 2024, our Board of Directors approved funding of $1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply chain systems (the “ERP System Implementation”). The ERP System Implementation spending comprises both capital expenditures and operating expenses, of which a majority is expected to relate to operating expenses. The operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented by region in several phases with spending occurring over the next five years, with expected completion by year-end 2028. Refer to \nNon-GAAP financial measures\n and Note 1,\n \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nfor additional information. \nExtreme Price Growth in Argentina\nDuring December 2023, the Argentinean peso significantly devalued. The peso's devaluation and potential resulting distortion on our non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other constant currency growth rate measures resulted in our decision to exclude the impact of pricing increases in excess of 26% year-over-year (\"extreme pricing\") in Argentina, from these measures beginning in Q1 2024. The benchmark of 26% represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year over a 3-year period which would result in a cumulative inflation rate in excess of 100%, the level at which an economy is considered hyperinflationary under U.S. GAAP. Throughout the following MD&A discussion, we now exclude, on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2024, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Revenue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding offset to changes in currency translation rates. Additionally within the MD&A discussion, \"currency-related items\" totals the impact of extreme pricing and the currency translation rate changes. Refer to \nNon-GAAP financial measures \nfor additional information. \nCurrency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:\n•\nOrganic Net Revenue: In total, unfavorable currency-related items of $710 million (2.0 pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $1,877 million (5.2 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (3.2 pp). In Emerging Markets, unfavorable currency-related items of $778 million (5.6 pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $1,945 million (13.9 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (8.3 pp). In Developed Markets, favorable currency-related items of $68 million (0.3 pp) were driven by favorable currency translation rate changes.\n•\nAdjusted Operating Income: Unfavorable currency-related items of $191 million were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $460 million, partially offset by extreme pricing of $269 million.\n•\nAdjusted EPS: Unfavorable currency-related items of $0.12 were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $0.32, partially offset by extreme pricing of $0.20.\n33\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nDuring 2024, we completed the acquisition of Evirth (Shanghai) Industrial Co., Ltd. (“Evirth”), a leading manufacturer of cakes and pastries in China.\nDuring 2022, we completed the following acquisitions to strategically complement and expand our existing portfolio:\n•\nRicolino, a confectionery business with products sold primarily in Mexico\n•\nClif Bar & Company (“Clif Bar”), a leading U.S. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients\n•\nChipita Global S.A. (\"Chipita\"), a high-growth leader in the central and Eastern European croissant and baked snacks category\nAdditionally in the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced an agreement to sell the developed market gum business. On October 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle Group, excluding the Portugal business which we retained pending regulatory approval. \nAfter obtaining the regulatory approval, w\ne completed the sale of the Portugal business to Perfetti Van Melle Group on October 23, 2023.\nRefer to Note 2, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, and \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n for additional details.\nInvestment Transactions\nJDE Peet’s Transactions (Euronext Amsterdam: “JDEP”)\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in JDEP, resulting in an impairment charge of €612 million ($665 million). On November 29, 2024, we sold our remaining 85.9 million shares to JAB Holdings Company and recorded a gain of €313 million ($332 million)\nIn 2023, we sold approximately 9.9 million of our shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 2.0 percentage points, from 19.7% to 17.7%. We recorded a loss of €21 million ($23 million). In 2022, we sold approximately 18.6 million of our shares back to JDEP, which reduced our ownership interest by approximately 3.0 percentage points. We recorded a loss of €8 million ($8 million).\nKeurig Dr Pepper Transactions (Nasdaq: \"KDP\") \nIn 2023, we sold the remainder of our shares in KDP, representing approximately 76 million shares. Our reduction in ownership to below 5% eliminated our significant influence over KDP, resulting in a change in accounting from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values in the first quarter of 2023. Prior to this change, we recorded a pre-tax gain on equity method transactions of $493 million ($368 million after-tax) in 2023. After the change in accounting, we recorded pre-tax gains for marketable securities of $606 million in 2023.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 7, \nInvestments \nand Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments.\nBenefit Plans\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement with two third party insurance companies for the Mondelēz Global LLC Retirement Plan (“MDLZ Global Plan”), the pension plan for US salaried employees. The agreement features a buy-in of the plan assets with an option to elect a future buy-out conversion. The MDLZ Global Plan was terminated on December 31, 2024,\n \nand we intend to execute the buy-out conversion in 2025. Refer to Note 10, \nBenefit Plans\n for additional information.\nTaxes\nWe continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world. Numerous countries have now enacted the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s model rules on a global minimum tax, effective for 2024. Important details of these minimum tax regimes are still being considered. Based on the guidance available thus far, this legislation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we will continue to evaluate it as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Outlook\nWe seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results. Refer to \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n for the definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n for the respective reconciliations.\nIn addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives:\nDemand\nWe monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Core snacks categories continued to expand due to the continued growth of snacking as a consumer behavior around the world. As part of our strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability across multiple channels. We believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.\nLong-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends\nSnack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. We believe that snacks continue to be a source of comfort as well as excitement and variety for consumers. Social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends, inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds. Consumers are also interested in buying snacks conveniently, whether through same-day delivery platforms, shipped sources or different retail settings. Many consumers also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions, valuing sustainably sourced ingredients, low carbon footprint preparation and lower waste packaging. We seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and preferences and align with our strategic priorities.\nPricing\nOur net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions, such as increasing input and operating costs due to supply, transportation and labor constraints, the impact of tariffs and higher cost trends. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including market factors, transportation, logistics and changes in our product input costs, and we have increased prices to control costs given significant cost inflation.\nOperating Costs\nOur operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material (particularly cocoa) and labor costs that have continued to rise. Refer to \nCommodity Trends \nfor additional information.\nTrade and Regulatory Uncertainty\nIn many markets, including the United States, a portion of our products, including significant inputs, are imported from other jurisdictions. On February 1, 2025, the United States government announced tariffs up to 25% on imports from certain countries, including Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on product imports from certain countries, including China. While we are still evaluating the potential impact of these actions as well as our ability to mitigate the impact, they are expected to adversely impact our revenue and cost of goods sold in the United States. If the provisions of those tariffs were maintained as proposed, we would expect those adverse impacts to be significant. In addition, retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries or other potential government actions, would likely result in further adverse impacts to our revenue and cost of goods sold. For additional information, see Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, including the risk entitled “\nWe are subject to risks from changes to the trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations by the U.S. and/or other foreign governments\n.”\n35\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Results \n \n•\nNet revenues were approximately $36.4 billion in 2024 and $36.0 billion in 2023, an increase of 1.2% in 2024 and an increase of 14.4% in 2023. \n–\nNet revenues increased in 2024, driven by higher net pricing and incremental net revenue from our acquisition of Evirth, partially offset by unfavorable currency-related items, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year, the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business and unfavorable volume/mix.\n–\nNet revenues increased in 2023, driven by higher net pricing, incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Clif Bar and Ricolino in 2022, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenue from a short-term distributor agreement related to the sale of our developed market gum business, partially offset by a significant impact from unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and the impact of our developed market gum divestiture in 2023.\n•\nOrganic Net Revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 4.3% to $37.1 billion in 2024 and increased 14.7% to $35.6 billion in 2023. In 2024, Organic Net Revenue increased due to higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. In 2023, Organic Net Revenue grew due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. Refer to \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n for the definition of Organic Net Revenue and \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n for our reconciliation with net revenues.\n•\nDiluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased 5.5% to $3.42 in 2024 and increased 84.7% to $3.62 in 2023. \n–\nDiluted EPS decreased in 2024 driven by lapping prior-year gain on marketable securities, lapping prior-year gain on equity method investment transactions, 2024 net loss on equity method transactions including an impairment, lapping prior-year gain and operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, higher intangible asset impairment charges and costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EPS, favorable year-over-year change in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivatives, lower divestiture-related costs, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, favorable year-over-year change in initial impacts from enacted tax law changes and lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter. \n–\nDiluted EPS increased in 2023 driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, a gain on marketable securities, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, higher net gain on equity method investment transactions, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, lapping prior year incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine, a gain on divestiture, lapping prior year loss on debt extinguishment, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges. These favorable items were partially offset by lower operating results from divestitures, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher negative initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position, higher divestiture-related costs, lapping prior year 2017 malware incident net recoveries and higher Simplify to Grow program costs. \n•\nAdjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 9.1% to $3.36 in 2024 and increased 15.4% to $3.08 in 2023. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 13.0% to $3.48 in 2024 and increased 20.2% to $3.21 in 2023. Refer to \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n for the definition of Adjusted EPS and \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n for our reconciliation with diluted EPS. \n–\nAdjusted EPS increased in 2024, driven by operating gains, fewer shares outstanding, lower taxes, lower interest expense, impact from an acquisition and higher benefit plan non-service income, partially offset by unfavorable currency-related items and lapping prior year dividend income related to our former KDP investment. \n–\nAdjusted EPS increased in 2023, driven by operating gains, impact from acquisitions, lower interest expense, fewer shares outstanding, dividend income from marketable securities and higher equity method investment earnings, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, higher taxes and lower benefit plan non-service income.\n36\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion and Analysis of Historical Results\nItems Affecting Comparability of Financial Results\nThe following table includes significant income or (expense) items that affected the comparability of our results of operations and our effective tax rates.

Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2024. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was driven by volume declines, reflecting the impacts of expected customer price negotiation disruptions in Europe primarily in the second quarter, consumer demand softness in the U.S. and Mexico in the first half of the year and geopolitical impacts in parts of AMEA, which were partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by a gain in AMEA, while North America was essentially flat. The November 1, 2024 acquisition of Evirth added incremental net revenues of $72 million (constant currency basis) in 2024. Currency-related items decreased net revenues by $710 million, driven by unfavorable currency \n38\nTable of Contents\ntranslation rate changes, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina. Refer to \nRecent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability \nfor additional information. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, primarily the Argentinean peso, as well as the Brazilian real, Nigerian naira, Turkish Lira, Russian ruble, Egyptian pound, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Polish zloty, euro and Colombian peso. The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $484 million in 2024.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2024, was reflected across all regions. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was due to volume declines partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was experienced in all regions.\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $563 million from 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, favorable contingent consideration adjustments related to the Clif Bar acquisition and lower acquisition integration costs, lapping prior-year divestiture-related costs, the elimination of costs from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, a favorable currency translation impact related to expenses and lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter, marginally offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $215 million from 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities.\nUnfavorable currency-related items, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased\n \noperating income by $191 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, Turkish lira, Chinese yuan and Nigerian naira, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling and Polish zloty.\nOperating income margin increased from 15.3% in 2023 to 17.4% in 2024. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by favorable year-over-year change in acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activities, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower divestiture-related costs, lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, partially offset by higher intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-year gain and the impact from the developed market gum business divested in 2023 and costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.9% in 2023 to 16.2% in 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and overhead cost leverage, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.\n40\nTable of Contents\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International\nNet earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $4,611 million decreased by $(348) million (7.0%) in 2024.

Overall, we continued to see strong demand for our snack category products across most regions. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2022 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2023. Favorable volume/mix was driven by AMEA, Latin America and Europe reflecting both improved product mix and volume gains, while volume/mix was essentially flat in North America. The November 1, 2022 acquisition of Ricolino added incremental net revenues of $507 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. The August 1, 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar added incremental net revenues of $529 million through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,096 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, primarily due to the Argentinean peso and Russian ruble as well as the Turkish lira, Egyptian pound, Indian rupee, Chinese yuan, Nigerian naira, Australian dollar, \n43\nTable of Contents\nSouth African rand, Pakistan rupee and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Mexican peso, euro, Brazilian real, Polish zloty and British pound sterling.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2022 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2023, was reflected across all regions. Overall, volume/mix benefited from improved product mix and continued strong demand for our snack category products across most regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by AMEA, Latin America and Europe, which was marginally offset by slightly unfavorable volume/mix in North America. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, slightly offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher energy, sugar, grains, dairy, cocoa, packaging, edible oils and other ingredients costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials. \nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses increased $618 million from 2022, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the impact of acquisitions, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher divestiture-related costs, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lapping prior-year 2017 malware incident net recoveries, which were offset by a lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, a favorable currency impact related to expenses, lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program, the impact from divestitures and lower incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $947 million from 2022. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities.\nUnfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $190 million, primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Russian ruble, Argentinean peso, Egyptian pound, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Turkish lira, Australian dollar and South African rand, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Polish zloty.\nOperating income margin decreased from 11.2% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lower incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine, gain on the sale of our developed market gum business, lower intangible asset impairment charges, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges, partially offset by higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher divestiture-related costs, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lapping prior year 2017 malware incident net recoveries. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.8% in 2022 to 15.9% in 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, overhead cost leverage, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.\n45\nTable of Contents\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Mondelēz International\nNet earnings attributable to Mondelēz International of $4,959 million increased by $2,242 million (82.5%) in 2023.

manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.\nWe use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends.

Currency-related items were unfavorable, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, due to currency translation rate changes. Unfavorable currency translation impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Chilean peso, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Colombian peso. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix reflected volume declines due to consumer softness, primarily in Mexico and Argentina, partially offset by favorable product mix. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in chocolate, candy, cheese & grocery and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits & baked snacks and gum. Higher net pricing, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, was driven by input cost-driven pricing actions and reflected across all categories, primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. \nSegment operating income increased $3 million (0.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity, lower acquisition integration costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses. These favorable items were mostly offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency-related items, unfavorable volume/mix, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and intangible asset impairment charges incurred in 2024. \n2023 compared with 2022\nNet revenues increased $1,377 million (37.9%), due to higher net pricing (31.0 pp), the impact of acquisitions (14.0 pp) and favorable volume/mix (3.8 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (10.0 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.9 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina as well as Brazil and Mexico. The November 1, 2022 acquisition of Ricolino added incremental net revenues of $507 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2023. Favorable volume/mix reflected strong volume growth as the region continued to see increased demand for most of our snack category products. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in gum, biscuits & baked snacks, candy and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages and chocolate. Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Mexican peso and Brazilian real. The impact of our 2022 divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $22 million.\nSegment operating income increased $141 million (36.3%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the impact of our Ricolino acquisition, favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher remeasurement loss on net monetary position and higher acquisition integration costs.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAMEA\n \n \nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n(in millions)\n \nNet revenues\n$\n7,296 \n$\n7,075 \n$\n221 \n3.1 \n%\nSegment operating income\n1,192 \n1,113 \n79 \n7.1 \n%\n \nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n2023\n2022\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n(in millions)\n \nNet revenues\n$\n7,075 \n$\n6,767 \n$\n308 \n4.6 \n%\nSegment operating income\n1,113 \n929 \n184 \n19.8 \n%\n2024 compared with 2023\nNet revenues increased $221 million (3.1%), due to higher net pricing (5.5 pp) the impact of an acquisition (1.0 pp), and favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp), partly offset by unfavorable currency translation rate changes (4.1 pp). Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. The November 1, 2024 acquisition of Evirth added incremental net revenues of $72 million (constant currency basis) in 2024. Overall, favorable volume/mix reflected favorable product mix, partially offset by volume declines reflecting the impact of geopolitical events in the region. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in gum, biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages and candy. Unfavorable currency translation impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Nigerian naira, Egyptian pound, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Vietnam dong, Philippine peso and Japanese yen.\nSegment operating income increased $79 million (7.1%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and the impact from our Evirth acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency translation rate changes, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, unfavorable volume/mix, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and an intangible asset impairment charge incurred in 2024.\n2023 compared with 2022\nNet revenues increased $308 million (4.6%), due to higher net pricing (8.6 pp) and favorable volume/mix (3.1 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (7.1 pp). Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. Favorable volume/mix reflected overall volume gains from increased demand for most of our snack category products. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, gum, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in biscuits & baked snacks and cheese & grocery. Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Egyptian pound, Indian rupee, Chinese yuan, Nigerian naira, Australian dollar, South African Rand, Pakistan rupee and Japanese yen.\nSegment operating income increased $184 million (19.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program.

Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix reflected volume declines due to the impact from customer price negotiation disruptions primarily in the second quarter, partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in chocolate, biscuits & baked snacks, refreshment beverages, candy and gum, partially offset by a gain in cheese & grocery. The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $174 million. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies across the region, including the Turkish lira, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Polish zloty and euro.\nSegment operating income increased $90 million (4.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower divestiture-related costs, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency translation rate changes, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and higher fixed asset impairment costs. \n2023 compared with 2022\nNet revenues increased $1,437 million (12.6%), due to higher net pricing (13.8 pp), favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp) and the impact from short-term distributor agreements (0.2 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (1.9 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp). Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. Overall, volume/mix was favorable driven by improved product mix. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate, gum and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery and candy. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies across the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone, Ukrainian hryvnya and Swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Polish zloty, British pound sterling and Swiss franc. The impact of divestitures reflected a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $4 million from our 2023 divested developed market gum business.\nSegment operating income increased $497 million (33.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping the prior year incremental costs incurred due to the war in Ukraine, lower acquisition integration costs and favorable volume/mix.

The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $310 million. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Volume/mix was flat for the year as volume trends improved in the second half of 2024 offsetting consumer softness experienced in the U.S. in the first half of 2024. Overall, a volume/mix gain in chocolate was offset by declines in biscuits & baked snacks and candy. Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. \nSegment operating income increased $400 million (19.1%), primarily due to a favorable contingent consideration adjustment related to Clif Bar as well as lower acquisition integration costs, higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower divestiture-related costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and lower fixed asset impairment charges. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, unfavorable volume/mix, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program. \n2023 compared with 2022\nNet revenues increased $1,398 million (14.4%), due to higher net pricing (9.5 pp), the impact of acquisitions (5.6 pp) and flat volume/mix (- pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (0.4 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.3 pp). Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. The August 1, 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar added incremental net revenues of $529 million through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2023. Overall, volume/mix was flat as slight volume gains were offset by unfavorable mix. Flat volume/mix was driven by gains in candy and chocolate offset by a decline in biscuits & baked snacks. While the impact of divestitures reflected a year-over-year increase in net revenues of $12 million (net of the loss of revenue for the fourth quarter) from our 2023 divested developed market gum business, it had a negative impact on the net revenue growth rate as the divested business did not grow as fast as the remaining segment. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. \nSegment operating income increased $323 million (18.3%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the impact of our Clif Bar acquisition, higher operating results from the divested developed market gum business, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, an intangible asset impairment charge incurred in 2023, divestiture-related costs incurred in 2023, unfavorable volume/mix and unfavorable currency.\n53\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nWe believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed. We continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and we continue to monitor our global operations including the impact of ongoing or new conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. To date, we have been successful in generating cash and raising financing as needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues or other adverse developments arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases), property, plant and equipment and any significant one-time non-operating items. \nLong-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to Note 9, \nDebt and Borrowing Arrangements\n), our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to Note 16, \nIncome Taxes\n), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to Note 11, \nBenefit Plans\n)\n \nand commodity-related purchase commitments and derivative contracts (refer to Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments\n). \nWe generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to \nDebt\n below). We generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations.\nFor a full discussion related to the financial condition for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, including a year-to-year comparison between 2023 and 2022, see Part II, Item 7 - \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\n and \nResults of Operations\n in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nCash Flow\nWe believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments. Our cash flow activity over the last three years is noted below:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by/(used in):\n Operating activities\n$\n4,910 \n$\n4,714 \n$\n3,908 \n Investing activities\n526 \n2,812 \n(4,888)\n Financing activities\n(5,780)\n(7,558)\n(456)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in cash-basis net earnings, largely due to operating gains, partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year working capital movements, including the payment of the European Commission matter. Refer to Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n for additional information.\nNet Cash Used in/Provided by Investing Activities\nThe reduction in net cash provided by investing activities was largely driven by lapping prior year proceeds from the developed market gum divestiture combined with lower proceeds from the current year JDEP share sale as compared to the prior year KDP and JDEP share sales, higher capital expenditures and cash consideration paid for the Evirth acquisition. Refer to Note 2, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures \nand\n \nNote 7, \nInvestments \nfor more information.\n54\nTable of Contents\nCapital expenditures were $1,387 million in 2024, $1,112 million in 2023 and $906 million in 2022. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2025 capital expenditures to be up to $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our ERP System Implementation program and for funding our strategic priorities. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher debt proceeds combined with lower debt repayments, partially offset by higher share repurchases and an increase in dividends paid to shareholders in 2024.\nDividends\nWe paid dividends of $2,349 million in 2024, $2,160 million in 2023 and $1,985 million in 2022. On July 30, 2024, the Audit Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.470 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 11 percent, which would be $1.88 per common share on an annualized basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.\nFor U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2024 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. See Note 13, \nCapital Stock\n, to the consolidated financial statements and Item 5, \nMarket for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n, for information on our share repurchase program.\nGuarantees\nAs discussed in Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.\nDebt\nThe nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.\nAt our July 2024 meeting, the Board of Directors approved a new $2 billion long-term financing authorization that replaced the prior long-term financing authorization of $2 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $1.5 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.\nOur total debt was $17.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and $19.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.40 at December 31, 2024 and 0.41 at December 31, 2023. The weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.7 years at December 31, 2024 and 7.8 years at December 31, 2023. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $1.1 billion in 2024, $2.1 billion in 2023 and $1.6 billion in 2022.\nOne of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), has outstanding debt. Refer to Note 9, \nDebt and Borrowing Arrangements\n. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 73.1% (or $26.6 billion) of the $36.4 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2024 and represented approximately 81.9% (or $22.1 billion) of the $27.0 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2024.\nRefer to Note 9, \nDebt and Borrowing Arrangements\n, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCommodity Trends\nWe regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2024, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, generally we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will broadly remain available.\nA number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic environment, including global inflation, effects of geopolitical uncertainty, climate and weather conditions, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, exchange rate volatility and the effects of local and global regulations, including trade policies, governmental agricultural or other programs affect the availability and cost of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. In particular, the supply of cocoa is exposed to many of these factors, including climate change and weather events, local regulations in cocoa-producing countries, and global regulations such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (which requires companies to ensure that the products they place on the EU market or export from it are not associated with deforestation). These factors could impact the supply of cocoa, which could potentially limit our ability to produce our products and significantly impact profitability.\nDuring 2024, price volatility and the higher aggregate cost environment increased due to international supply chain and labor market disruptions and generally higher commodity, transportation and labor costs. We expect these conditions to continue to impact our aggregate commodity costs. In particular, we expect to face higher cocoa costs in the near- and medium-term due to these factors. For example, the market price for cocoa beans on the Intercontinental Exchange in London was 161% higher on the last trading day of the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same day in the fourth quarter of 2023 and it is likely that prices will remain elevated for some time. It is possible that we may not be able to increase prices sufficiently to fully cover the incremental costs of cocoa prices in this environment and/or our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in cocoa costs, which could result in a significant impact on our profitability. \nWe address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible future price decreases. Additionally, our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.\n56\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures along with a discussion of our underlying GAAP results throughout our \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n in this Form 10-K.\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis \n(1)\n.\n•\n“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures \n(2)\n, short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business \n(3)\n, and currency rate fluctuations \n(4)\n. We believe that Organic net revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP above.\n•\nOur emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. \n•\nOur developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.\n•\n“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program\n (5)\n; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture\n (2)\n or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs\n (6)\n, acquisition-related costs \n(7)\n, and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments\n (8)\n; inventory step-up charges \n(9)\n; the operating results of divestitures\n (2)\n; operating results from short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business \n(3)\n; remeasurement of net monetary position\n (10)\n; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts\n (11)\n; impact from resolution of tax matters\n (12)\n; 2017 malware incident net recoveries; incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine \n(13)\n; impact from the European Commission legal matter \n(14)\n; the impact from pension participation changes\n (15)\n; and operating costs from the ERP System Implementation program \n(16)\n. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis\n (4)\n. We believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.\n•\n“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities \n(17)\n; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes \n(18)\n; and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions \n(19)\n. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis \n(4)\n. We believe Adjusted EPS provides improved comparability of underlying operating results.\n57\nTable of Contents\n(1)\nWhen items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. Beginning in Q1 2024, due to a significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso that occurred in December 2023 and the resulting distortion it would cause on our non-GAAP constant currency growth rate measures, we now exclude the impact of pricing in excess of 26% year-over-year (\"extreme pricing\") in Argentina, which is the level at which hyperinflation generally occurs cumulatively over a 3-year period. We have excluded the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from our calculation of Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding adjustment to changes in currency exchange rates. We made this change on a prospective basis due to the distorting effect expected in the current period and future periods following the Argentinian peso devaluation that occurred in December 2023 and did not revise our historical non-GAAP constant currency growth measures. Beginning in Q2 2024, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation program as they represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations (see footnote (16) below).\n(2)\nDivestitures include completed sales of businesses, exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement, the partial or full sale of an equity method investment and changes from equity method investment accounting to accounting for marketable securities. \n(3)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we began to exclude the operating results from short-term distributor agreements that have been executed in conjunction with the sale of a business. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(4)\nConstant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we also now include within our currency-related impacts a corresponding adjustment associated with the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina.\n(5)\nNon-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.\n(6)\nDivestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and completion (including one-time costs such as severance related to the elimination of stranded costs) of our divestitures as defined in footnote (2), also includes costs incurred associated with our publicly-announced processes to sell businesses. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. \n(7)\nAcquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investment banking and legal fees, also includes one-time compensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) shares and realized gains or losses from hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(8)\nAcquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments include one-time costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustments made to contingent compensation liabilities for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to recurring employee compensation expense. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. See Note 10, \nFinancial Instruments - Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\n for additional information.\n(9)\nIn the third quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the one-time inventory step-up charges associated with acquired companies related to the fair market valuation of the acquired inventory. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(10)\nIn connection with our applying highly inflationary accounting (refer to Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n), for Argentina (beginning in the third quarter of 2018), Türkiye (beginning in the second quarter of 2022) and Egypt and Nigeria (beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024), we exclude the related remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in the local currency to the U.S. dollar during the periods presented and the realized gains and losses from derivatives that mitigate the foreign currency volatility related to the remeasurement of the respective net monetary assets or liabilities during the periods presented.\n(11)\nWe exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.\n(12)\nSee Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(13)\nIn February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we stopped our production and closed our facilities in Ukraine for a period of time due to damage incurred to our facilities during the invasion. We began to incur incremental costs directly related to the war including asset impairments, such as property and inventory losses, higher expected allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and committed compensation. We have isolated and exclude these costs and related impacts as well as subsequent recoveries from our operating results to facilitate evaluation and comparisons of our ongoing results. Incremental costs related to increasing operations in other primarily European facilities are not included with these costs.\n(14)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the impact from the European Commission legal matter. In November 2019, the European Commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of European Union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. As of December 31, 2022, we recorded an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. We have cooperated with the investigation and reached a negotiated, resolution to this matter. We subsequently adjusted our accrual accordingly and fulfilled our payment obligation in August 2024. Due to the unique nature of this matter, we believe it to be infrequent and unusual and therefore exclude it to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. Refer to Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n for additional information.\n(15)\nThe impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from \n58\nTable of Contents\nour non–GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 11, \nBenefit Plans\n, for additional information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.\n(16)\nIn July 2024, our Board of Directors approved funding of $1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply chain systems (the “ERP System Implementation”), which is comprised of both capital expenditures and operating expenses, of which a majority is expected to be operating expenses. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented in several phases with spending occurring over the next five years, with expected completion by year-end 2028. The operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations. These expenses include third-party consulting fees, direct labor costs associated with the program, accelerated depreciation of our existing SAP financial systems and various other expenses, all associated with the implementation of our information technology upgrades. These operating expenses will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures as they are nonrecurring and excluding those costs will better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(17)\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we began to exclude mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses, as well as realized gains or losses, associated with our marketable securities from our non-GAAP earnings measures. These marketable securities gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\n(18)\nWe have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. Initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 U.S. tax reform. We exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law.\n(19)\nWe exclude gains and losses on equity method transactions including impairments of our equity method investments. In addition, we also exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures any gains or losses realized on economic hedges on sales proceeds from our equity method investment transactions, which have been recorded in \nInterest and other expense, net\n. These items are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K, which can be found above under \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets\nWe review our operating segment and reporting unit structure annually or as significant changes in the organization occur for goodwill testing throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. Annually, on July 1, we test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment and may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2024 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.\nAnnually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. If potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.\nIn 2024, we recorded $153 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to two biscuit brands in the Europe segment, one biscuit brand in the AMEA segment and one candy and one biscuit brand in the Latin America segment. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within \nasset impairment and exit costs\n. We use several accepted valuation methods, including relief from royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We identified thirteen brands, as part of our annual test, that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. The aggregate value of the thirteen brands was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2024. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to not be impaired, but if plans to grow brand revenue and earnings, and expand margin are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2023, we recorded $26 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe. In 2022, we recorded $101 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to two biscuit brands in AMEA.\nRefer to Note 6, \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n, for additional information.\n60\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. We engage third-party valuation specialists to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In determining fair value, we utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon the best information available at the date of acquisition. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: expected future cash flows of the acquired business, discount and royalty rates and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names and fixed assets. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.\nFurther, certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. As of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. Any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration will be recognized as expenses or earnings in the period in which they occur. Such contingent consideration liabilities are based on best estimates of future expected payment obligations, which are subject to change due to many factors outside of our control. Changes to the estimate of expected future contingent consideration payments may occur, from time to time, due to various reasons, including changing discount rates as well as actual results differing from estimates and adjustments to the revenue or earnings assumptions used as the basis for the liability based on historical experience. \nTrade and Marketing Programs\nWe promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor various employee benefit plans worldwide, including primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.\nWe amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods to reflect the cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost). These changes are deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.\nSince pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. For plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 11, \nBenefit Plans\n, along with additional information on our employee benefit plans.\n61\nTable of Contents\nAs a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs:\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n \nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\nFifty-Basis-Point\nFifty-Basis-Point\n \nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\n \n(in millions)\nEffect of change in discount rate on\n   pension costs\n$\n2 \n$\n(2)\n$\n(14)\n$\n19 \nEffect of change in expected rate of return on\n   plan assets on pension costs\n(7)\n7 \n(36)\n36 \nEffect of change in discount rate on\n   postretirement health care costs\n(1)\n1 \n— \n— \nIncome Taxes\nAs a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We review the realizability assessment on a quarterly basis, including impacts from our latest estimates of future taxable income.\nWe believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.\nSee Note 16, \nIncome Taxes\n, for additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.\nContingencies\nSee Note 14, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\n62\nTable of Contents",
