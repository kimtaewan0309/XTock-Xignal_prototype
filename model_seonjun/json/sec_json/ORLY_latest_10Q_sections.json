Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n​\nUnless otherwise indicated, “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms, as well as references to the “Company” or “O’Reilly,” refer to O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\n​\nIn Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including\n●\nan overview of the key drivers and other influences on the automotive aftermarket industry;\n●\nour results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024;\n●\nour liquidity and capital resources;\n●\nour critical accounting estimates; and\n●\nrecent accounting pronouncements that may affect our Company.\n​\nThe review of Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be made in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information, forward-looking statements, and other risk factors included elsewhere in this quarterly report. \n​\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n​\nWe claim the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “estimate,” “may,” “could,” “will,” “believe,” “expect,” “would,” “consider,” “should,” “anticipate,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” or similar words.  In addition, statements contained within this quarterly report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, such as statements discussing, among other things, expected growth, store development, integration and expansion strategy, business strategies, future revenues, and future performance.  These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events and results.  Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the economy in general;

availability of key products and supply chain disruptions; business interruptions, including terrorist activities, war and the threat of war; failure to protect our brand and reputation; challenges in international markets; volatility of the market price of our common stock; our increased debt levels; credit ratings on public debt; damage, failure, or interruption of information technology systems, including information security and cyber-attacks; historical growth rate sustainability; our ability to hire and retain qualified employees; risks associated with the performance of acquired businesses; and governmental regulations.  Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results described or implied in these forward-looking statements.  Please refer to the “Risk Factors” section of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings, for additional factors that could materially affect our financial performance.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. \n​\nOVERVIEW\n​\nWe are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada.  We are one of the largest North American automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both DIY customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.”  Our goal is to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages, such as our dual market strategy, superior customer service provided by well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, and strategic distribution and hub store network that provides same day and over-night inventory access for our stores to offer a broad selection of product offerings.  The successful execution of our growth strategy includes aggressively opening new stores, growing sales in existing stores, continually enhancing merchandising and store layouts, and implementing our Omnichannel initiatives.  As of September 30, 2025, we operated 6,406 stores in 48 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, 107 stores in Mexico, and 25 stores in Canada. \n​\nThe extensive product line offered in our stores consists of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools, and professional service provider service equipment.  Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer.  For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives.  Our sales and total gross profit dollars are, generally, highest for the “best” quality category of products.  Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of enhanced sales and profitability in our industry.  We have ongoing \n17\n\n\ninitiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum. \n​\nOur stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter, and battery recycling; battery, wiper, and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. \n​\nOur business is influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and consumers, including, but not limited to, inflation, tariffs, fuel and energy costs, unemployment trends, interest rates, and other economic factors.  Future changes, such as continued broad-based inflation and rapid fuel cost increases that exceed wage growth, may negatively impact our consumers’ level of disposable income, and we cannot predict the degree these changes, or other future changes, may have on our business or industry. \n​\nWe believe the key drivers of demand over the long-term for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of miles driven, number of registered vehicles, annual rate of light vehicle sales, and average vehicle age.  Currently, our consolidated revenue is primarily generated within the United States.\n​\nNumber of Miles Driven \nThe number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.  In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation.  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. increased 2.1% and 1.0% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, and year-to-date through July of 2025, miles driven have increased 0.9%.  Total miles driven can be impacted by macroeconomic factors, including rapid increases in fuel cost, but we are unable to predict the degree of impact these factors may have on miles driven in the future.  \n​\nSize and Age of the Vehicle Fleet \nThe total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry.  As reported by the Auto Care Association, the total number of U.S. registered vehicles increased 13.4% from 2014 to 2024, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 286 million by the end of 2024.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was approximately 16.8 million vehicles, and for 2025, the SAAR is estimated to be approximately 16.4 million vehicles, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road.  From 2014 to 2024, U.S. vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.1% to 5.6% annually.  As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased 10.5%, from 11.4 years in 2014 to 12.6 years in 2024.  While the annual changes to the vehicle population resulting from new vehicle sales and the fluctuation in vehicle scrappage rates in any given year represent a small percentage of the total light vehicle population and have a muted impact on the total number and average age of vehicles on the road over the short term, we believe our business benefits from rising average new and used vehicle prices, as consumers are generally more willing to continue to invest in their current vehicle.  \n​\nWe believe the increase in average vehicle age over the long term can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors, coupled with consumers’ willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles.  As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty.  These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures, and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.  We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles, and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.\n​\nInflationary cost pressures impact our business; however, historically we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases, principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs and economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases.  To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases or other input cost increases affecting the entire industry, we have typically been able to pass along these cost increases through higher selling prices for the affected products.  As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operating results. \n​\nTo some extent, our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.  While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.\n​\n18\n\n\nWe remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.    \n​\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n​\nSales:\nSales for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased $341 million, or 8%, to $4.71 billion from $4.36 billion for the same period one year ago. Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased $755 million, or 6%, to $13.37 billion from $12.61 billion for the same period one year ago.  Comparable store sales increased 5.6% and 1.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.  Comparable store sales increased 4.5% and 2.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.  Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for U.S. stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, and sales to Team Members, as well as sales from Leap Day in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  Online sales for ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders for U.S. stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation. We opened 55 and 160 net, new stores during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to opening 47 and 111 net, new stores during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.  Additionally, we began operating 23 stores in Canada from the Groupe Del Vasto (“Vast Auto”) acquisition during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  We anticipate total new store growth to be 200 to 210 net, new store openings in 2025. We anticipate total new store growth to be 225 to 235 net, new store openings in 2026.\n​\nThe increase in sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily the result of the 5.6% increase in domestic comparable store sales and a $101 million increase in sales from new stores opened in 2024 and 2025 that are not considered comparable stores.  The increase in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily the result of the 4.5% increase in domestic comparable store sales and a $260 million increase in sales from new stores opened in 2024 and 2025 that are not considered comparable stores, partially offset by the effect of sales from one additional day in the prior year due to Leap Day.  Our comparable store sales increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were driven by increases in average ticket values for both professional service provider and DIY customers and an increase in transaction counts for professional service provider customers, partially offset by a decrease in transaction counts for DIY customers.  Average ticket values benefited from increases in average selling prices on a same-SKU basis, as compared to the same periods in 2024, driven by increases in acquisition costs of inventory, which were passed on in selling prices.  Average ticket values continue to be positively impacted by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles.  These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time.  The resulting decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values.   The decreases in DIY customer transaction counts were driven by pressured consumer spending on discretionary categories and broader industry pressure on certain hard part categories.\n​\nSee Note 11 “Revenue” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the Company’s sales.  \n​\nGross Profit:\nGross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased 8% to $2.44 billion (or 51.9% of sales) from $2.25 billion (or 51.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  Gross Profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased 7% to $6.89 billion (or 51.5% of sales) from $6.45 billion (or 51.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  The increase in gross profit dollars for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily the result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores.  The increase in gross profit dollars for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily the result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores, partially offset by prior year gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to Leap Day.  The increases in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were primarily due to improved acquisition costs and distribution operating efficiencies, partially offset by a greater percentage of our total sales mix being generated from professional service provider customers, which carry a lower gross margin percentage than DIY sales.  \n \n​\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased 8% to $1.46 billion (or 31.1% of sales) from $1.35 billion (or 31.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  SG&A for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased 8% to $4.26 billion (or 31.8% of sales) from $3.94 billion (or 31.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  The increase in total SG&A dollars for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily the result of additional Team Members and operating expenses to support our increased sales and store count.  The increase in total SG&A dollars for the the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily the result of additional Team Members and operating expenses to support our increased sales and store count, partially offset by prior year incremental SG&A expenses incurred from one additional day due to Leap \n19\n\n\nDay.  The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was principally due to broad inflationary pressure in costs, primarily relating to medical and casualty insurance programs.  The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was principally due to broad inflationary pressure in costs and enhancements to store level compensation and benefits.\n \n​\nOperating Income:\nAs a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased 9% to $976 million (or 20.7% of sales), from $897 million (or 20.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased 5% to $2.63 billion (or 19.7% of sales) from $2.51 billion (or 19.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago.\n​\nOther Income and Expense:\nTotal other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased 7% to $52 million (or 1.1% of sales) from $49 million (or 1.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  Total other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased 6% to $163 million (or 1.2% of sales) from $153 million (or 1.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  The increases in total other expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.\n \n​\nIncome Taxes:\nOur provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased 8% to $198 million (21.4% effective tax rate) from $182 million (21.5% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago.  Our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased 2% to $536 million (21.7% effective tax rate) from $524 million (22.2% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago.  The increases in our provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were the result of the higher taxable income and lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by higher transferable federal renewable energy tax credits.  The decreases in our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were primarily the result of higher transferable federal renewable energy tax credits, partially offset by lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n​\nNet Income:\nAs a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased 9% to $726 million (or 15.4% of sales) from $665 million (or 15.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased 5% to $1.93 billion (or 14.5% of sales) from $1.84 billion (or 14.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago.\n​\nEarnings Per Share:\nOur diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased 12% to $0.85 on 853 million shares from $0.76 on 875 million shares for the same period one year ago.  Our diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased 8% to $2.25 on 858 million shares from $2.08 on 884 million shares for the same period one year ago.\n​\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n​\nOur long-term business strategy requires capital to maintain and enhance our existing stores, invest to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, and develop enhanced information technology systems and tools and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.  Our material cash requirements necessary to maintain the current operations of our long-term business strategy include, but are not limited to, inventory purchases; human capital obligations, including payroll and benefits; contractual obligations, including debt and interest obligations; capital expenditures; payment of income taxes; and other operational priorities.  We expect to fund our short- and long-term cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity, which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program, and senior note offerings.  However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows or maintain liquidity at or above recent levels, as we are unable to predict decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns.  Additionally, these factors could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\n \n​\nThere have been no material changes to the contractual obligations, to which we are committed, since those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n​\n20\n\n\nThe following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFor the Nine Months Ended

investments for the period.  See page \n22\n for the reconciliation of the calculation of free cash flow.\n​\nOperating Activities:\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to the timing of payment for transferrable federal renewable energy tax credits, partially offset by an increase in operating income. \n​\nInvesting Activities:\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, was the result of an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by the acquisition of Vast Auto in the prior year.  The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to distribution enhancement and expansion projects and an increase in investments in new store growth. \n​\nFinancing Activities:\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, was attributable to net borrowings on the Company’s commercial paper program in the current period versus net paydown on commercial paper during the same period in 2024, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. \n​\nDebt Instruments:\nSee Note 7 “Financing” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the Company’s credit agreement, unsecured revolving credit facility, outstanding letters of credit, commercial paper program, and unsecured senior notes. \n​\nDebt Covenants:\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.  These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.  As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes. \n​\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00.  The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges.  Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, and rent expense.  The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and non-cash share-based compensation expense.  Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit, and similar instruments, five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.  In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement, and litigation from our lenders. \n​\n21\n\n\nWe had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.03 times and 6.14 times as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.93 times and 1.85 times as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. \n​\nThe table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in

charge coverage ratio, and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial \n22\n\n\ninformation.  We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement.  We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.  Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.  We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n​\nShare Repurchase Program:\nSee Note 9 “Share Repurchase Program” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our share repurchase program.  \n​\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n​\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.  Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. There have been no material changes in the critical accounting estimates since those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. \n​\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n​\nSee Note 15 “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.\n​"
