We are a BHC under the BHCA and one of the nation’s largest bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total assets of approximately $187.2 billion at December 31, 2024. KeyCorp is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association, its principal subsidiary, through which most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance, student loan refinancing, commercial mortgage servicing and special servicing, and investment banking products and services to individual, corporate, and institutional clients through two major business segments: Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. \nAs of December 31, 2024, these services were provided across the country through KeyBank’s 944 full-service retail banking branches and a network of 1,182 ATMs in 15 states, as well as additional offices, online and mobile banking capabilities, including our national digital brand, Laurel Road, and a telephone banking call center. Additional information pertaining to our two business segments is included in the “Business Segment Results” section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report, and in Note 25 (“Business Segment Reporting”) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are incorporated herein by reference. \nIn addition to the customary banking services of accepting deposits and making loans, our bank and its trust company subsidiary offer personal and institutional trust custody services, personal financial and planning services, access to mutual funds, treasury services, and international banking services. Through our bank, trust company, and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to clients that include large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and endowments, high-net-worth individuals, and multi-employer trust funds established for providing pension or other benefits to employees.\nWe provide other financial services — both within and outside of our primary banking markets — through various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include community development financing, securities underwriting, investment banking and capital markets products, and brokerage. We also provide merchant services to businesses.\nKeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its security holders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that KeyCorp’s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.\nWe derive the majority of our revenues within the United States from customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nDemographics\nOur management structure and basis of presentation is divided into two business segments, Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. Note 25 (“Business Segment Reporting”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, including changes in basis of presentation.\nThe Consumer Bank serves individuals and small businesses throughout our 15-state branch footprint and through our Laurel Road digital brand by offering a variety of deposit and investment products, personal finance and financial wellness services, lending, student loan refinancing, mortgage and home equity, credit card, treasury services, and business advisory services. In addition, wealth management and investment services are offered to assist non-profit and high-net-worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, charitable giving, and related needs. \nThe Commercial Bank consists of the Commercial and Institutional operating segments. The Commercial operating segment is a full-service, commercial banking platform that focuses primarily on serving the borrowing, cash \n6\nTable of contents\nmanagement, and capital markets needs of middle market clients within Key’s 15-state branch footprint. The Institutional operating segment operates nationally in providing lending, equipment financing, and banking products and services to large corporate and institutional clients. The industry coverage and product teams have established expertise in the following sectors: Consumer, Energy, Healthcare, Industrial, Public Sector, Real Estate, and Technology. It is also a significant, national, commercial real estate lender and third-party master and special servicer of commercial mortgage loans. The operating segment includes the KBCM platform which provides a broad suite of capital markets products and services including syndicated finance, debt and equity underwriting, fixed income and equity sales and trading, derivatives, foreign exchange, mergers & acquisition and other advisory, and public finance. \nAdditional Information\nOur executive offices are located at 127 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio 44114-1306, and our telephone number is (216) 689-3000.

Legislative, regulatory, economic, and technology changes, as well as consolidation within the financial services industry, could result in increased competition from new and existing market participants. Key competes with other providers of financial services, such as BHCs, commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, private credit funds, investment banking firms, broker-dealers, financial technology companies, and other local, regional, national, and global institutions that offer financial services. Some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources, while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services. Mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on Key’s core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards. Successfully competing in our markets also depends on our ability to invest in technology and infrastructure, execute transactions reliably and effectively, maintain and enhance our reputation, and attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, all while prudently managing risks and expenses. For more information on competition and related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - “We operate in a highly competitive industry.”\nHuman Capital\nEngaging a high performing and collaborative workforce is a top strategic priority for Key. Our human capital management strategy is focused on attracting, retaining, developing, motivating and rewarding the talent our businesses need to drive sound, profitable growth, and ultimately, enhance shareholder value, which we do by offering a competitive total rewards package, providing opportunities for career development and growth, and fostering a culture that is fair and inclusive for all. \nCompetitive Rewards\nWe make investments to hire and retain the people we need to serve our customers and communities and regularly review our pay practices to reflect changing market and economic conditions. We have steadily increased our starting minimum wage since 2015, and as of December 31, 2024, 93% of employees earned $20 or more per hour. We have made other compensation adjustments in response to market trends, competitive pressures, and a dynamic market for talent.\nThese investments include a comprehensive and competitive total rewards program, representing our investment in our teammates’ collective success and reflecting our commitment to helping them thrive. Key’s benefits offerings include employee health and welfare plans, a 401(k) plan with competitive matching contributions (dollar for dollar, up to the first 7% of eligible pay contributed on a per pay period basis for eligible employees), up to ten weeks of paid parental leave, a Discounted Stock Purchase Plan, wellness incentives, and a lifestyle reimbursement account program for covered expenses related to health, mental wellness, family needs, and finances.\nTeammates can also participate in a variety of company-sponsored volunteer and giving opportunities, including Neighbors Make the Difference Day, our national employee volunteer day, and the Employee Matching Gift Program, which offers eligible employees the opportunity to support qualified nonprofit organizations and multiply their contributions through the KeyBank Foundation. \nWe have a pay-for-performance culture that is guided by the following three principles:\n•\nPay decisions are based on Key’s performance, business unit performance, and individual performance.\n•\nWe deliver pay in a way that balances short-term and long-term financial performance objectives and aligns to shareholder value creation.\n•\nWe support sustainable performance with policies that focus on prudent risk-taking and the balance between risk and reward.\nWe design our compensation programs to balance risk and reward and align with the guidance of our regulators, and we regularly monitor these programs to remain within our risk tolerances. We subject all discretionary \n8\nTable of contents\nincentives paid to our employees to a robust risk adjustment process that begins before grant and extends beyond payment.  \nCareer Development and Growth\nWe invest in our teammates’ growth and professional development through a variety of internal networking groups that are open to all teammates, including our Key Business Impact and Networking Groups (“KBINGs”), formal and informal mentoring programs, including Key’s enterprise-wide formal mentoring program, MentorMe at Key, and a suite of leadership development programs. We also offer employees the opportunities to develop and enhance their skills through formal learning curricula and to obtain tuition reimbursement for eligible collegiate or post-collegiate education and relevant certifications. \nKey’s Workforce\nKey had an average of 16,753 full time equivalent employees in \n2024\n. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 17,406 full-time and part-time employees worked in the following regions, which are generally aligned to the regions Key uses for its retail branch banking network:\nRegion\nEmployee Count\nEast\n12,399\nWest \n2,834\nAll Other\n2,173\nWe invest significant time and resources in creating an attractive work environment and competitive total rewards package that attracts and retains top talent. Key’s annualized rate for voluntary turnover as of December 31, 2024, was 13.2%, lower than our annualized voluntary turnover rate for 2023, which was 14.6%, and lower than our previous five-year historical average of 15.3%.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nKeyCorp’s executive officers are principally responsible for managing the operations of KeyCorp, making policy for KeyCorp, executing on strategic decisions, and managing material risks, subject to the supervision and direction of \n9\nTable of contents\nthe Board.

Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing. We cannot predict changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory agency policies, but any such changes may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or access to liquidity or credit. \nOverview\nFederal law establishes a system of regulation under which the Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators: (i) the OCC for national banks and federal savings associations; (ii) the FDIC for state non-member banks and savings associations; (iii) the Federal Reserve for state member banks; (iv) the CFPB for consumer financial products or services; (v) the SEC and FINRA for securities broker/dealer activities; (vi) the SEC, CFTC, and NFA for swaps and other derivatives; and (vii) state insurance regulators for insurance activities. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation. \nUnder the BHCA, BHCs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, without prior approval from the Federal Reserve. In addition, BHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities. However, a BHC that satisfies certain requirements regarding management, capital adequacy, and Community Reinvestment Act performance may elect to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (“FHC”) for purposes of federal law, and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities. KeyCorp has elected to be treated as a FHC and, as such, is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, and merchant banking activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve has permitted FHCs, like KeyCorp, to engage in the following activities, under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity: physical commodities trading activities, energy management services, and energy tolling, among others.\nUnder federal law, a BHC also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institution(s) by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress. This support may be required when the BHC does not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it. Certain loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a BHC, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC to overlay the U.S. supervisory framework for BHCs, insured depository institutions, and other financial service providers, by serving as a systemic risk oversight body. Specifically, the FSOC is authorized to: (i) identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected SIFIs, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (ii) promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the U.S. government will shield shareholders, creditors, and counterparties from losses in the event of failure; and (iii) respond to emerging threats \n11\nTable of contents\nto the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination; information collection and sharing; designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment, clearing, and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight; recommending stricter standards for SIFIs; and, together with the Federal Reserve, determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability.\nAs an FHC, KeyCorp is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC. At December 31, 2024, we operated one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities. The FDIC also has certain, more limited regulatory, supervisory, and examination authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the FDIA and the Dodd-Frank Act.\nWe have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Because KeyBank engages in derivative transactions, in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became a member of the NFA, the self-regulatory organization for participants in the U.S. derivatives industry. Our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators, and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business.\nRegulatory capital requirements\nBackground\nKeyCorp and KeyBank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”).  The Basel Committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions, to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale, and to promote financial stability.\nThe regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee and implemented in the United States is a predominately risk-based capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets, adjusted to reflect credit risk (“risk-weighted assets”).  Each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum risk-based capital measures (e.g., a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets), and in the United States, a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total on-balance sheet assets, which serves as a backstop to the risk-based measures.\nA capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis.  Capital instruments with relatively robust loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 1, while other capital instruments with relatively less loss-absorption capacity are assigned to tier 2.  A banking organization’s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital.\nThe Basel Committee also developed a market risk capital framework (that also has been implemented in the United States) to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit risk-based capital requirements described above.  For example, the minimum total risk-based capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization’s total capital to the sum of its credit risk-weighted assets and market risk-weighted assets.  Only KeyCorp is subject to the market risk capital rule, as KeyBank does not engage in substantial trading activity.\nBasel III\nTo address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, in 2010 the Basel Committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework, commonly referred to as “Basel III.”  The Basel III revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital, in part through the introduction of a Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement; provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage, particularly for securitization exposures, equities, and off-balance sheet positions; and address pro-cyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital \n12\nTable of contents\nbuffers.  The Basel Committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation (e.g., arbitrage opportunities between the credit risk-based and market risk capital rules) and in connection with the global financial crisis.\nKeyCorp and KeyBank are subject to regulatory capital requirements implemented by the U.S. banking agencies that are based largely on Basel III (“Regulatory Capital Rules”). Consistent with the international framework, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital; establish a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment; and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets.  The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to KeyCorp or KeyBank. However, some of those additional requirements will apply to KeyCorp and KeyBank if proposed revisions to the Regulatory Capital Rules are adopted. The proposed revisions to the Regulatory Capital Rules are discussed below under the heading “Recent regulatory capital-related developments.” For purposes of the Regulatory Capital Rules, KeyCorp and KeyBank are treated as “standardized approach” banking organizations.\nUnder the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank,  are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table. At December 31, 2024, KeyCorp’s ratios under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in the following table.\nMinimum Capital Ratios and KeyCorp Ratios Under Regulatory Capital Rules\nRatios (including stress capital buffer)\nRegulatory Minimum Requirement\nStress Capital Buffer \n(b)\nRegulatory Minimum With Stress Capital Buffer\nKeyCorp December 31, 2024 \n(c)\nCommon Equity Tier 1\n4.50 \n%\n3.10 \n%\n7.60 \n%\n11.92 \n%\nTier 1 Capital\n6.00 \n3.10 \n9.10 \n13.69 \nTotal Capital\n8.00 \n3.10 \n11.10 \n16.15 \nLeverage \n(a)\n4.00 \nN/A\n4.00 \n10.03 \n(a)\nAs a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplementary leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018. However, KeyCorp will be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio if proposed revisions to the Regulatory Capital Rules discussed below are adopted.\n(b)\nStress capital buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules. However, KeyCorp will be subject to the countercyclical capital buffer if proposed revisions to the Regulatory Capital Rules discussed below are adopted.\n(c)\nRatios reflect the five-year transition of CECL impacts on regulatory ratios.\nKey elected the CECL phase-in option provided by regulatory guidance which delayed for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital and phases it in over three years beginning in 2022. Effective for the first quarter 2022, Key entered a three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard was phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, CECL will be fully reflected in regulatory capital. On a fully phased-in basis, Key’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio would be reduced by five basis points.\nRevised prompt corrective action framework\nThe federal prompt corrective action (“PCA”) framework under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States, the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the PCA capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank. The Revised PCA framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the Prompt Corrective Action Framework.\n“Well Capitalized” and “Adequately Capitalized” Capital Category Ratios under\nRevised Prompt Corrective Action Framework\nPrompt Corrective Action\nCapital Category\nRatio\nWell Capitalized \n(a)\nAdequately Capitalized\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based\n6.5 \n%\n4.5 \n%\nTier 1 Risk-Based\n8.0 \n6.0 \nTotal Risk-Based\n10.0 \n8.0 \nTier 1 Leverage \n(b)\n5.0 \n4.0 \n(a)\nA “well capitalized” institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.\n(b)\nAs a standardized approach banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplementary leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018. However, KeyCorp will be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio if proposed revisions to the Regulatory Capital Rules discussed below are adopted.\n13\nTable of contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the PCA framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function.  Moreover, it is important to note that the PCA framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.\nRecent regulatory capital-related developments\nOn July 27, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a proposal (the “Capital Proposal”) that would make significant changes to the Regulatory Capital Rules applicable to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their depository institution subsidiaries (“Large Banking Organizations”) (including KeyCorp and KeyBank) and banking organizations with significant trading activity. This proposal would implement the final elements of the Basel III capital framework and make other changes to the Regulatory Capital Rules in response to the bank failures that occurred in 2023. The Capital Proposal would establish a new framework for calculating risk-weighted assets (the “expanded risk-based approach”) that would apply to Large Banking Organizations. The expanded risk-based approach would include a new more risk-sensitive standardized approach for measuring credit risk and operational risk. It would also include new standardized approaches for measuring market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk but would allow the use of internal models for market risk in certain circumstances with regulatory approval. Under the Capital Proposal, a Large Banking Organization would be required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the expanded risk-based approach and the current standardized approach and would use the lower of the two. All capital buffer requirements, including the stress capital buffer requirement, would apply regardless of whether the expanded risk-based approach or the existing standardized approach produces the lower ratio.\nThe Capital Proposal would also align the calculation of regulatory capital for Category III and IV banking organizations with the calculation of regulatory capital for Category I and II banking organizations. KeyCorp and KeyBank are Category IV banking organizations. Under the proposal, Category III and IV banking organizations would be required to include most components of AOCI, including net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, in regulatory capital. Category III and IV banking organizations would also be required to apply the same capital deductions and minority interest treatments that currently apply to Category I and Category II banking organizations. In addition, all Large Banking Organizations would be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio and countercyclical capital buffer requirement and would be required to make certain enhanced public disclosures.\nThe expanded total risk-weighted assets calculation used in the expanded risk-based approach would be phased in over a three-year period. For Category III and IV banking organizations, the requirement to reflect AOCI in regulatory capital would also be phased in over a three-year period. All other elements of the calculation of regulatory capital would apply on the effective date of a final rule if the proposal is adopted. Comments on this proposal were due by January 16, 2024.\nLiquidity requirements\nU.S. banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the Basel Committee (the “Basel III liquidity framework”).  The Basel III liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned, from a balance sheet perspective, to satisfy its short- and long-term funding needs.\nTo address short-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio (“Basel III LCR”), calculated as the ratio of a banking organization’s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days. In addition, to address long-term liquidity risk, the Basel III liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio (“Basel III NSFR”), calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding.  \nConsistent with the Basel III LCR, the final rules implementing the Basel III LCR for U.S. banking organizations (the “Liquidity Coverage Rules”) established a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp), and a modified version of the LCR (“Modified LCR”) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). Under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp was required to calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100%. KeyBank was not subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules.\n14\nTable of contents\nLarge BHCs, like KeyCorp, are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”). As enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements, including enhanced liquidity standards, upon BHCs (like KeyCorp) with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  \nEGRRCPA, enacted on May 24, 2018, raised the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards to BHCs from $50 billion to $250 billion. EGRRCPA gave the Federal Reserve the authority to continue to apply enhanced prudential standards to any BHCs having at least $100 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets (like KeyCorp) if it determines that the application of the standard is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the BHC or BHCs, taking into consideration the BHC’s or BHCs’ capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size, and other relevant factors.\nAs a result of the Federal Reserve’s implementation of certain of the enhanced prudential standards, KeyCorp is subject to requirements relating to cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, liquidity risk limits, the monitoring of liquidity risks (with respect to collateral, legal entities, currencies, business lines, and intraday exposures), liquidity stress testing, a liquidity buffer, and liquidity risk management requirements, including requirements that apply to the board of directors, the risk committee, senior management, and the independent review function. \nFinal rules related to the implementation of EGRRCPA (“Tailoring Rules”) established four risk-based categories of banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category. KeyCorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories (“Category IV Firms”).\nUnder one of the Tailoring Rules, Category IV Firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion will not be subject to a modified LCR. KeyCorp does not meet the $50 billion threshold and is not subject to the modified LCR or an LCR public disclosure requirement. \nUnder another Tailoring Rule, Category IV Firms (like KeyCorp) are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements. Category IV Firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow need over a 30-day planning horizon under the firm’s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored FR 2052a liquidity reporting requirements.\nUnder the final rules adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the Basel III NSFR for U.S. banking organizations, certain banking organizations with more than $100 billion in total assets must maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. Under the rules, KeyCorp, as a Category IV firm with average weighted short-term wholesale funding of less than $50 billion, is not subject to an NSFR requirement.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nThe Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule requires each U.S.-domiciled, top-tier BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion (like KeyCorp) to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process. The capital plan must be submitted to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review in connection with the BHC’s CCAR (described below). The supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors, including KeyCorp’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon. \nThe Federal Reserve’s CCAR is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large U.S. BHCs and of the practices these BHCs use to assess their capital needs. The Federal Reserve expects BHCs subject to CCAR to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and, at the same time, be able to continue operations, maintain ready access to funding, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, and provide credit intermediation.\n15\nTable of contents\nThe Federal Reserve has conducted a supervisory stress test on KeyCorp, pursuant to which the Federal Reserve projects revenues, expenses, losses, and resulting post-stress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the U.S. economy or the financial condition of KeyCorp, including supervisory baseline and severely adverse scenarios, that are determined by the Federal Reserve. KeyCorp and KeyBank have also been required to conduct their own company-run stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios (including supervisor-provided baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios and, for KeyCorp, one KeyCorp-defined baseline scenario and at least one KeyCorp-defined stress scenario) on their consolidated earnings, losses, and capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, taking into account their current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. While KeyBank currently only has to conduct an annual stress test, KeyCorp has had to conduct both an annual and a mid-cycle stress test in the past. KeyCorp and KeyBank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. \nUnder one of the Tailoring Rules,\n KeyCorp is no longer required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of company-run stress tests and is subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve every other year rather than every year. In 2024, KeyCorp was required to participate in the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.\nSince the adoption of a final rule by the federal banking agencies in October 2019, KeyBank is no longer required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Also, this final rule removes the “adverse” scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to BHCs and federally-regulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only “baseline” and “severely adverse” scenarios.\nOn March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the Federal Reserve’s Regulatory Capital Rules with CCAR and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to BHCs that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The final rule amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the Regulatory Capital Rules by replacing the static risk-weighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure, the stress capital buffer, which will be based on the results of an individual BHC’s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. A firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement. A firm’s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect until September 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve.\nOn August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies’ Regulatory Capital Rules. The revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization, including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the Federal Reserve on March 4, 2020. The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies’ capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress.\nOn January 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to Category IV standards (including KeyCorp) to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the Federal Reserve adopted in an October 2019 rulemaking. The final rule revised the elements of the capital plan that Category IV firms are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements. Also, the final rule updated the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms.\nOn June 26, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 31 BHCs having more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets (including KeyCorp). The Federal Reserve indicated that all BHCs subject to the stress test maintained capital ratios above the minimum required levels under the severely adverse scenario. The stress test results for individual BHCs (including KeyCorp) were used by the Federal Reserve to determine a BHC’s updated stress capital buffer requirement. The Federal Reserve published the updated stress capital buffer requirements on August 28, 2024. KeyCorp’s updated stress capital buffer is 3.1%. This stress capital buffer became effective on October 1, 2024 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2025, unless KeyCorp later receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the Federal Reserve.\nOn December 23, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced that it intends to propose changes to its stress testing framework in order to improve the transparency of the stress tests and reduce the volatility of the resulting capital \n16\nTable of contents\nrequirements. The Federal Reserve said that it plans to, among other things, disclose and seek public comment on the models and scenarios used in the stress tests and to average results over two years to reduce year-over-year changes in capital requirements. Changes to the stress testing framework would apply to KeyCorp.  \nOn December 24, 2024, five trade associations filed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio to challenge the stress testing framework on the basis that the current framework violates the Administrative Procedures Act and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. The parties bringing the lawsuit indicated that they do not object to the use of stress tests to set stress capital buffer requirements but that they want to ensure that the Federal Reserve subjects the stress tests to public notice and comment and complies with other applicable legal requirements. KeyCorp is monitoring developments in this case. \nDividend restrictions\nFederal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries, like KeyBank. Historically, dividends paid by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, without the prior approval of the OCC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits. Moreover, under the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. Similarly, under the Regulatory Capital Rules, a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions. For more information about the payment of dividends by KeyBank to KeyCorp, please see Note 3 (“Restrictions on Cash, Dividends, and Lending Activities”) in this report.\nFDIA, Resolution Authority and Financial Stability\nDeposit insurance and assessments\nThe DIF provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like KeyBank. The amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor’s deposits is $250,000 per depository.\nThe FDIC must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution’s assessment base, calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. KeyBank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its assessment base. The rate charged depends on KeyBank’s performance on the FDIC’s “large and highly complex institution” risk-assessment scorecard, which includes factors such as KeyBank’s regulatory rating, its ability to withstand asset and funding-related stress, and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank’s failure.\nOn October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule, applicable to all insured depository institutions (including KeyBank), to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points consistent with the Amended Restoration Plan approved by the FDIC on June 21, 2022. The FDIC indicated that it was taking this action in order to restore the DIF reserve ratio to the required statutory minimum of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. Under the final rule, the increase in rates began with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023 and will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2% in order to support growth in the DIF in progressing toward the FDIC’s long-term goal of a 2% reserve ratio.\nOn March 10, 2023, and March 12, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) and Signature Bank (“Signature”) were closed by the state banking authorities in California and New York, respectively, and the FDIC was appointed as receiver of SVB and Signature. All deposits of SVB and Signature were transferred to bridge banks established by the FDIC under the systemic risk exception to the least cost test in the FDIA so that the uninsured deposits as well as the insured deposits of both banks were protected by the FDIC. Under the FDIA, the loss to the DIF arising from the use of the systemic risk exception must be recovered through one or more special assessments.\n17\nTable of contents\nOn November 16, 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to impose a special assessment on IDIs to recover the loss to the DIF resulting from the use of the systemic risk exception to protect the uninsured depositors of SVB and Signature. Under the final rule, the FDIC would collect a special assessment from IDIs at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods, starting with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024. The assessment base for the proposed special assessment is equal to an IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits held by the IDI. Because the estimated loss to the DIF from the use of the systemic risk exception will be periodically adjusted and because the total assessments collected may change due to corrective amendments filed by covered IDIs regarding the reported amount of uninsured deposits for the December 31, 2022 reporting period, the FDIC may cease collection of the special assessment early, extend the special assessment collection period, or impose a final shortfall special assessment.\nIn the final rule, the FDIC indicated that the special assessment is a tax-deductible operating expense for IDIs, and that it assumed that the effect on income of the entire amount of the special assessment would occur in one quarter for the IDIs subject to the assessment. The initial impact of the special assessment to Key was approximately $190 million in pre-tax expense, which was recognized upon issuance of the final rule in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe FDIC has indicated that the loss estimates to be recovered by the special assessment will be periodically adjusted as the FDIC (as receiver of the failed banks) sells assets, satisfies liabilities, and incurs receivership expenses. The FDIC said that it will provide any updates regarding the amount and collection period for the special assessment when it sends the quarterly deposit insurance assessment invoices to the IDIs subject to the special assessment. In the first quarter of 2024, the FDIC announced an increase in its estimate of losses from protecting the uninsured depositors of SVB and Signature and, therefore, increased the amount that it would collect through the special assessment. Because of this updated estimate, Key incurred an incremental pre-tax expense of $29 million in the first quarter of 2024. Based on the quarterly invoices Key received from the FDIC in June 2024, September 2024, and December 2024, Key recorded an incremental pre-tax expense of $5 million in the second quarter of 2024, and a reversal of pre-tax expense of $6 million and $3 million in the third and fourth quarter of \n2024\n, respectively, to true-up initial estimates to invoiced amounts.\nThe FDIC’s final rule for a special assessment discussed above was not intended to recover the loss to the DIF from the failure of First Republic Bank in May 2023 (initially estimated as a $13 billion loss) or to the DIF from the failures of SVB and Signature that was not related to the protection of uninsured depositors (initially estimated as a $2.7 billion loss). The FDIC indicated that no further adjustments to assessments are contemplated at this time to recover those losses but that it will re-evaluate this issue in the future when it updates projections for the DIF balance and the reserve ratio in connection with its periodic review of the DIF Restoration Plan that was adopted in 2022. The FDIC updates these projections at least semiannually.\nConservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions\nUpon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership (or conservatorship) assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of KeyCorp’s insured depository institution subsidiary, KeyBank, including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors.\n18\nTable of contents\nReceivership of certain SIFIs\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime, as an alternative to bankruptcy, known as the “orderly liquidation authority” (“OLA”) for certain SIFIs, including BHCs and their affiliates. Under the OLA, the FDIC would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing SIFI. The determination that a SIFI should be placed into OLA receivership is made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, who must conclude that the SIFI is in default or in danger of default and that the SIFI’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system. This determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and consultation between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the President.\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the OLA, its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the OLA. The powers of a receiver under the OLA are generally based on the FDIC’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the FDIA. Certain provisions of the OLA were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the OLA. However, substantial differences between the two regimes remain, including the FDIC’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure under OLA to determine creditors’ claims (rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy), the FDIC’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity, and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual cross-defaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership. OLA liquidity would be provided through credit support from the U.S. Treasury and assessments made, first, on claimants against the receivership that received more in the OLA resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation (to the full extent of the excess), and second, if necessary, on SIFIs like KeyCorp utilizing a risk-based methodology.\nDepositor preference\nThe FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the institution’s parent BHC and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.\nResolution and recovery plans\nBHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, have been required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators. The Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans. The public sections of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank are available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/resolutions/fdic-and-financial-regulatory-reform-title-i-and-idi-resolution-planning/. KeyCorp’s last resolution plan was submitted in 2017, and KeyBank’s last resolution plan was submitted in 2022. KeyCorp is no longer required to submit a resolution plan because of the rule change discussed below while KeyBank remains subject to resolution plan requirements as discussed below. \nBHCs with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets are no longer required to submit a resolution plan unless they have $75 billion or more in certain risk-based indicators. Under this rule, KeyCorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements. \nOn June 20, 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule to amend and restate its current resolution plan rule in order to clarify and strengthen resolution plan submission requirements and reflect lessons learned since the adoption of the FDIC’s current resolution plan rule in 2012. Among other things, the final rule (i) requires IDIs with more than $100 billion in total assets that are affiliated with a U.S. G-SIB to submit full resolution plans every two years, (ii) requires IDIs with more than $100 billion in total assets that are not affiliated with a U.S. G-SIB (including KeyBank) to submit full resolution plans every three years, (iii) requires IDIs with total assets between $50 billion and $100 billion to submit informational filings every three years, (iv) requires triennial filers to submit more limited supplements in the off years, (v) enhances and clarifies the requirements for the content of resolution submissions, (vi) codifies certain \n19\nTable of contents\naspects of guidance and feedback provided to filers subject to the current rule, (vii) expands expectations regarding engagement and capabilities testing, and (viii) establishes an enhanced credibility standard for the evaluation of resolution submissions. The final rule was effective on October 1, 2024. KeyBank is required to file its next resolution plan by July 1, 2025, which will be its initial filing under the final rule.\nOn October 21, 2024, the OCC adopted revisions to its recovery planning guidelines. The OCC’s recovery planning guidelines require large OCC-regulated banks to develop and maintain a recovery plan that identifies triggers and options for responding to a wide range of severe internal and external stress scenarios so that the bank can be restored to financial strength and viability in a timely manner if it were to experience such stress situations. The OCC revised these guidelines to (i) expand the applicability of the guidelines to banks with at least $100 billion in average total consolidated assets, (ii) add a requirement for covered banks to test their recovery plans to ensure that their plans will be effective during periods of severe stress, and (iii) clarify that recovery plans should consider non-financial risks (including operational and strategic risks) as well as financial risks. KeyBank is subject to the OCC’s revised recovery planning guidelines. KeyBank is required to be in compliance with these guidelines by January 1, 2026 except that KeyBank’s compliance with the testing requirement is delayed until January 1, 2027. \nOther Regulatory Requirements and Developments\nThe Bank Secrecy Act\nThe BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Key has established and maintains an AML program to comply with the BSA’s requirements.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nTitle X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion, like Key, to carry out federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to Key’s consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.\nVolcker Rule\nThe Volcker Rule implements Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits “banking entities,” such as KeyCorp, KeyBank and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds (referred to as “covered funds”) and engaging in short-term proprietary trading of financial instruments, including securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments.\nThe Volcker Rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading, including transactions in government securities (e.g., U.S. Treasuries or any instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any state or a political division of any state, among others); transactions in connection with underwriting or market-making activities; and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers. A banking entity may also engage in risk-mitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific, identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity. The banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and, if necessary, adjusted on an ongoing basis. \nKey does not anticipate that the proprietary trading or covered fund restrictions in the Volcker Rule will have a material impact on its business, but it was required to divest certain fund investments. As of June 30, 2023, Key has completed conforming and/or divesting certain indirect investments subject to the Volcker Rule.\n20\nTable of contents\nEnhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards upon BHCs, like KeyCorp, with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Prudential standards were required to include enhanced risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk-management and risk committee requirements, resolution plan requirements, credit exposure report requirements, single counterparty credit limits (“SCCL”), supervisory and company-run stress test requirements and, for certain financial companies, a debt-to-equity limit. Early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions, acquisitions, and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans, capital raising requirements, limits on transactions with affiliates, management changes, and asset sales in later stages of financial decline, which would be triggered by forward-looking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures.\nEGRRCPA raised the asset threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards to BHCs from $50 billion to $250 billion and gave the Federal Reserve the authority to apply enhanced prudential standards to BHCs with at least $100 billion in assets. Please see the discussion\n under the headings “Regulatory capital requirements - Liquidity requirements” and “Regulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing” for more information about EGRRCPA and the related Tailoring Rules.  \nSince 2010, the Federal Rule has implemented the following \nenhanced prudential standards\n required under the Dodd-Frank Act: (i) the resolution plan requirements (through a joint final rule adopted with the FDIC), (ii) stress test requirements, (iii) the incorporation of the Regulatory Capital Rules through the Federal Reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests; (iv) liquidity requirements; (v) the risk management framework, including requirements around the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management; and (vi) a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity, limit for companies that the FSOC determines pose a “grave threat” to U.S. financial stability. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued a final rule establishing SCCL requirements, but that rule does not apply to KeyCorp. The Federal Reserve has yet to implement a final rule on the early remediation requirements.\nBank transactions with affiliates\nFederal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank’s parent BHC and certain companies the parent BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. These provisions significantly restrict the ability of KeyBank to fund its affiliates, including KeyCorp, KBCM, and KeyCorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments (and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested). The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions.\nSupervision and governance\nKeyCorp is subject to the Federal Reserve’s supervisory rating system for large financial institutions, which includes BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more (including KeyCorp) (“LFI Rating System”). The LFI Rating System provides a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions and assesses an institution’s capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. Ratings issued under the LFI Rating System are confidential.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including low- and moderate-income (“LMI”) neighborhoods, consistent with the institutions’ safe and sound operations. The CRA requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI neighborhoods.\n21\nTable of contents\nOn October 24, 2023, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to strengthen and modernize their regulations implementing the CRA to better achieve the purposes of the law, adapt to changes in the banking industry, and provide clarity and consistency in the application of their regulations. Among other things, the final rule (1) clarifies what activities constitute eligible community development activities, (2) adopts four new tests under which large banks with more than $2 billion in assets (including KeyBank) will be evaluated, (3) applies a new framework for assigning conclusions and ratings to banks, (4) updates requirements for delineating facility-based assessment areas, (5) provides for the evaluation of certain large banks in retail lending assessment areas as well as facility-based assessment areas, and (6) imposes new data collection and reporting requirements. The four new tests under which large banks will be evaluated are a retail lending test, a retail services and products test, a community development financing test, and a community development services test. Various metrics and performance standards will be applied under these tests. Most provisions of the final rule will be effective on January 1, 2026, while certain reporting requirements will be effective on January 1, 2027. KeyBank is subject to the final rule.\nVarious trade associations filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking to invalidate the CRA final rule. In their lawsuit, the trade associations argued that the federal banking agencies exceeded their authority in adopting the CRA final rule. On March 29, 2024, the court in that case issued a preliminary injunction barring the federal banking agencies from enforcing the CRA final rule against the plaintiffs pending the resolution of this lawsuit. The court also extended all implementation dates under the CRA final rule, day for day, for each day that the injunction remains in place. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and would suffer irreparable harm if they had to incur costs to prepare to comply with a rule that might later be invalidated. The court’s decision granting a preliminary injunction is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Key is monitoring developments in this case.\nDevelopments relating to climate change\nOn October 24, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a set of principles that provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks for financial institutions with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. These principles are intended to provide large financial institutions with guidance in their efforts to identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate physical and transition risks associated with climate change. These principles discuss how these risks can be addressed in the following areas: governance; policies, procedures, and limits; strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement, and reporting; and scenario analysis. These principles also describe how climate-related financial risks can be addressed in connection with various specific risk categories, including credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal/compliance risk. This interagency guidance applies to KeyCorp and KeyBank.\nLong-term debt requirement\nOn August 29, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued for public comment a proposal that would require certain large BHCs and certain large IDIs to issue and maintain minimum amounts of long-term debt (“LTD”). This proposal would apply to Category II, III, and IV BHCs (including KeyCorp) and IDIs that (i) are not consolidated subsidiaries of U.S. global systemically important banks and (ii) have at least $100 billion in total assets (including KeyBank) or are affiliated with an IDI that has at least $100 billion in total assets. Under the proposal, the required minimum amount of LTD would be the greater of 6 percent of an entity’s total risk-weighted assets, 3.5 percent of an entity’s average total consolidated assets, and 2.5 percent of an entity’s total leverage exposure if it is subject to the supplementary leverage ratio. IDIs that are consolidated subsidiaries of BHCs would be required to issue the LTD to their parent company or another entity that consolidates the IDI.\nDebt instruments issued to satisfy the minimum LTD requirement would have to meet certain criteria including, among other things, being unsecured, have a remaining maturity of more than one year, and not provide the holder with acceleration rights except in limited circumstances. BHCs subject to the proposal would also have to comply with certain “clean holding-company” requirements such as a cap on liabilities other than eligible LTD and a prohibition on entering into most qualified financial contracts with third parties. The proposal would provide a three-year transition period with the incremental phase-in of the requirements during this period. The federal banking agencies indicated that the proposal would improve the resolvability of the covered entities in case of their failure, reduce costs to the DIF, and mitigate contagion and financial stability risks by reducing the risk of loss to uninsured depositors. Comments on the proposal were due by January 16, 2024. \n22\nTable of contents\nDebit card interchange fee cap\nOn October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve issued for public comment a proposal to lower the maximum interchange fee that a debit card issuer with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including KeyBank) can receive for a debit card transaction. The interchange fee cap is currently set at the sum of 21 cents for each transaction plus an amount equal to 0.05% of the value of the transaction and a one cent fraud prevention adjustment for issuers that satisfy certain criteria. In the new proposal, the Federal Reserve proposed to lower the cap to the sum of 14.4 cents for each transaction plus an amount equal to 0.04% of the value of the transaction and a 1.3 cent fraud prevention adjustment. The Federal Reserve indicated that it was proposing this revision to the fee cap to reflect changes in issuer costs. The Federal Reserve also proposed to update the amount of the fee cap every other year going forward by using data it collects in a biennial survey of large debit card issuers. Comments on the proposal were due by May 12, 2024.\nPersonal financial data rights\nOn October 22, 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule to implement Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which gives individuals the right to obtain data regarding consumer financial products and services they have obtained. The final rule requires financial institutions (including KeyBank) and other financial service providers (collectively “data providers”) to make available to consumers and authorized third parties, upon request, data in the data provider’s possession or control concerning covered consumer financial products or services (including credit cards, deposit accounts, and other accounts that facilitate payments) in an electronic form usable by the consumers and authorized third parties. The data that must be provided includes account balance information, at least 24 months of transaction history, pricing information, information on upcoming third-party bill payments, and account verification information. The data providers are required to create and maintain consumer and developer interfaces that will be able to transfer the data. A data provider will not be allowed to charge any fees or other charges for making the covered data available or for maintaining the required interfaces. The CFPB indicated that it adopted this rule in order to foster competition and consumer choice and said that this rule is a step towards bringing about an “open banking” system in the United States. Compliance with the rule will be phased in over several years with KeyBank required to be in compliance by April 1, 2027. Following the issuance of this rule, two trade associations and a national bank headquartered in Kentucky filed a lawsuit challenging the rule in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. In this lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that the CFPB exceeded its statutory authority in adopting the rule. Key is monitoring developments in this case.\n23\nTable of contents",

Some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. When you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. The page locations of specific sections and notes that we refer to are presented in the Table of Contents. To review our financial condition and results of operations for 2022 and a comparison between the 2022 and 2023 results, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our \n2023 Form 10-K\n filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nCorporate strategy\nWe remain committed to enhancing long-term shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship-based business model, growing our franchise, and being disciplined with respect to capital management.  We intend to pursue this commitment by growing profitably; acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships; effectively managing risk and rewards; maintaining financial strength; and engaging, retaining, and inspiring our high-performing and talented workforce and fostering a culture that is fair and inclusive for all. These strategic priorities for enhancing long-term shareholder value are described in more detail below.\n•\nGrow profitably\n \n—\n We intend to continue to focus on generating positive operating leverage by growing revenue and creating a more efficient operating environment. We expect our relationship business model to keep generating organic growth as it helps us expand engagement with existing clients and attract new customers. We plan to leverage our continuous improvement culture to maintain an efficient cost structure that is aligned, sustainable, and consistent with the current operating environment and that supports our relationship business model. \n•\nAcquire and expand targeted client relationships\n \n—\n We seek to be client-centric in our actions and have taken purposeful steps to enhance our ability to acquire and expand targeted relationships. We seek to provide solutions to serve our clients' needs. We focus on markets and clients where we can be the most relevant.

We intend to continue to engage our high-performing and talented workforce to create an environment where everyone can make a difference, own their careers, be respected, and feel a sense of pride.\n50\nTable of contents\nExecutive overview\nOur 2024 financial results were generally positive and reflected the impact of large securities repositioning trades that enhanced our future earnings trajectory. Net interest income was down, reflecting lower loans and changes in interest rates, but remained within our target range versus 2023. Fee growth was stronger than expected reflecting the second highest year of investment banking revenues in our history. At December 31, 2024, our Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 11.92% and 13.69%, respectively. We achieved meaningful positive operating leverage in the second half of the year and look to continue to deliver earnings growth and operating leverage in 2025.\nStrategic Minority Investment by Scotiabank\nOn August 12, 2024, we entered into an Investment Agreement with Scotiabank pursuant to which Scotiabank agreed to make a strategic minority investment in KeyCorp of approximately $2.8 billion, representing approximately 14.9% pro forma common stock ownership of KeyCorp, for a fixed price of $17.17 per share. On August 30, 2024, Scotiabank completed the initial purchase of our Common Shares with an investment of approximately $821 million in gross proceeds. Following the initial purchase, Scotiabank owned approximately 4.9% of KeyCorp’s common stock.\nOn December 13, 2024, Key announced that all necessary bank regulatory approvals had been received for completion of Scotiabank’s strategic minority investment in KeyCorp. On December 27, 2024, Scotiabank completed the final purchase of our Common Shares contemplated under the Investment Agreement with an investment of approximately $2.0 billion (the “Second Closing”). Following the Second Closing, Scotiabank owns approximately 14.9% of our Common Shares.\nOn December 27, 2024, in connection with the Second Closing, the Board of Directors of KeyCorp increased the size of the Board to fifteen directors  and appointed Jacqueline Allard and Somesh Khanna to serve on the Board, effectively immediately upon the Second Closing. \nRefer to Note 24 (“Shareholders' Equity”) for additional information on this transaction.\nSecurities Repositioning\nOn September 6, 2024, we initiated a strategic repositioning of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio by selling approximately $7.0 billion in market value of low-yielding mortgage-backed securities. The mortgage-backed securities that were sold had a weighted average book yield of approximately 2.3% and an average duration of approximately six years. Reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale was completed in October 2024, with the new securities having an average book yield of approximately 4.95% and an average duration of approximately four years. During the third quarter of 2024, along with our customary sale of short-dated U.S. Treasuries set to mature within the quarter, we also sold approximately $3 billion in U.S. Treasuries yielding 50 basis points that were set to mature in the fourth quarter of 2024. The total pre-tax loss on the sale of securities available for sale for the third quarter was $935 million of which $918 million was associated with the strategic repositioning.\nPrior to the Second Closing, KeyCorp completed the strategic repositioning of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio by selling an additional $3.0 billion in market value of low-yielding investment securities and terminating approximately $3.0 billion of fair value hedges, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $915 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. The investment securities that were sold had a weighted average book yield of approximately 1.5% and an average duration of approximately eight years. The reinvestment of the proceeds from the repositioning was completed in December 2024, with the new securities having an average book yield of 5.5% and an average duration of approximately four years. \nIn addition to the items described above, the following actions and results during 2024 also supported our overall corporate strategy. \n•\nWe have expanded our commercial banking business in Chicago and Southern California to serve more middle market clients with our differentiated platform, which includes a full range of commercial lending and capital markets capabilities as well as payments solutions designed specifically for the segment.\n•\nWe completed core technological modernization projects of our commercial loan platform and our derivatives platform.\n51\nTable of contents\n•\nWe ended the year with $61.4 billion in assets under management and administration, a record high, reflecting the strong sales production in our mass affluent segment.\n•\nWithin our Consumer Bank, we grew relationship households in excess of three percent for the second consecutive year, including growth of five to eight percent throughout our western markets.\n•\nWe remained committed to our strategy to engage a high-performing and talented workforce and fostering an inclusive environment for all\n. \nWe continue to be recognized by multiple organizations for our dedication to creating an environment where all employees are treated with respect and empowered to bring their authentic selves to work. \nBusiness Outlook \nConsistent with the forward guidance we provided on January 21, 2025, we expect these results for full year 2025 versus full year 2024.\nCategory\n2024 Baseline\nFY2024 vs FY2023\nFY2025 (vs FY 2024)\n(a)\nAverage loans\n$107.7 Billion\n(9)%\ndown 2% to 5%\nEnding loans\n$104.3 Billion\n(7)%\nFlat vs YE 2024\nPE Commercial Loans\n$71.9 Billion\n(7)%\nup 2% to 4%\nNet interest income (TE)\n$3,810 Million\n(3)%\nup ~20%\n(b)\nAdjusted noninterest income\n(c)\n$2,645 Million\n+7%\nup 5%+\nAdjusted noninterest expense\n(c)\n$4,520 Million\n+3%\nup 3% to 5%\nNet charge-offs to average loans\n41 bps\n+ 20 bps\n40 to 45 basis points (FY2025)\nEffective tax rate\n~21% to 22% (FY2025)\nTax-equivalent Effective Rate\n(d)\n~23% to 24% (FY2025)\n(a) Ranges are shown on an operating basis.\n(b) Additional Guidance: Net interest income (TE): 10%+ 4Q25 vs. 4Q24. \n(c) Refer to the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation within Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-K for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures.\n(d) Reflects the estimated full year taxable-equivalent adjustment. \n52\nTable of contents\nResults of Operations\nEarnings Overview\nThe following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023, to the year ended December 31, 2024 (dollars in millions): \nNet interest income\nOne of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:\n•\nthe volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;\n•\nthe volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;\n•\nthe use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;\n•\ninterest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace;\n•\nasset quality; and\n•\nfair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nTo make it easier to compare both the results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “TE basis” (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, would yield $100.\n53\nTable of contents\nNet interest income (TE) for 2024 was $3.8 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.16%. Compared to 2023, net interest income (TE) decreased $133 million, and the net interest margin was relatively stable, decreasing by one basis point. The decline in net interest income (TE) and the net interest margin reflects higher deposit costs, partly due to a shift in funding mix from noninterest-bearing deposits to higher cost deposits in 2024, and lower loan balances, in part due to the residual effect of Key’s balance sheet optimization efforts during the second half of 2023. Net interest income (TE) and the net interest margin benefited from higher earning asset yields as a result of the higher interest rate environment, including the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing investment securities into higher-yielding investments. Net interest income (TE) and the net interest margin also benefited from the maturity of interest rate swaps with negative carry, and an increase in lower-cost deposits, which contributed to the decline in wholesale borrowings. In addition, during the second half of 2024, Key completed the available-for-sale portfolio repositioning, which involved the sale and reinvestment of approximately $10.0 billion of lower-yielding mortgaged-backed securities into higher-yielding investments. \nAverage loans totaled $107.7 billion for 2024, compared to $118.0 billion in 2023. The $10.3 billion decrease reflected continued tepid client loan demand. Commercial loans decreased $7.6 billion, due to lower commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgage real estate loans. Additionally, average consumer loans declined by $2.6 billion, reflective of broad-based declines across all consumer loan categories. \nAverage deposits totaled $146.2 billion for 2024, an increase of $2.1 billion compared to 2023, reflecting growth in both consumer and commercial deposits, partially offset by a decline in brokered CDs. \nFigure 1 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past three years. This figure also presents a reconciliation of TE net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those years. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of our earning assets less the cost of funding, is calculated by dividing taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.\n54\nTable of contents\nFigure 1.

The  decrease in our provision for credit losses was driven by reserve releases, partly offset by higher net charge-offs. The net reserve release in 2024 was driven by changes in the economic outlook and planned balance sheet optimization efforts, which offset reserve increases attributable to asset quality migration. The higher net charge-offs were largely driven by the commercial and industrial portfolio.\n56\nTable of contents\nNoninterest income\nNoninterest income for 2024 was $809 million, inclusive of the $1.8 billion loss from the investment portfolio repositioning, compared to $2.5 billion during 2023. Noninterest income represented 18% of total revenue for 2024 and 39% of total revenue for 2023. \nThe following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.\nFigure 3. Noninterest Income\n \n57\nTable of contents\nTrust and investment services income\nTrust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management fees, and insurance income. The assets under management or administration that primarily generate these revenues are shown in Figure 4. For 2024, trust and investment services income increased $41 million, or 7.9%. This was primarily due to an increase in investment management income and other fees stemming from increased assets under management.\nA significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At December 31, 2024, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management or administration of $61.4 billion, compared to $54.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase from 2023 to 2024 was attributable to movements in the market and net new business. \nFigure 4.

For 2024, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $146 million, or 26.9%, from the prior year reflective of growth across all products excluding commercial mortgage activity. \nService charges on deposit accounts\nService charges on deposit accounts decreased $9 million, or 3.3%, in 2024 compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven by lower overdraft, maintenance, and service fees, offset slightly by higher account analysis fees. \nCards and payments income\nCards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income decreased $9 million, or 2.6%, in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by a decrease in debit interchange fees, partially offset by an increase in card reward costs.\nOther noninterest income\nOther noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, commercial mortgage servicing fees, net securities gains (losses), and other income. Other noninterest income decreased $1.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to approximately $1.8 billion in losses on the sales of securities available for sale as part of portfolio repositioning activity during the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Excluding the impact of the repositioning activity, other noninterest income was relatively flat, increasing $3 million, reflecting an increase in commercial mortgage servicing fees offset by decreases in operating lease income and corporate services income.\nNoninterest expense\nNoninterest expense for 2024 was $4.5 billion, compared to $4.7 billion for 2023. Figure 5 gives a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. \n58\nTable of contents\nThe following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.\nFigure 5. Noninterest Expense\n \n(a)\nOther noninterest expense includes equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, intangible asset amortization and other miscellaneous expense. See the \"Consolidated Statements of Income\" in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nPersonnel\nAs shown in Figure 6, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $54 million, or 2.0%, in 2024 compared to 2023. Overall activity for the year was driven by higher incentive compensation from strong capital markets activity during the year, partially offset by a decrease in severance expense. Salaries and contract labor were down reflecting a decrease in FTE’s, offset slightly by increased contract labor costs. \nFigure 6.

The effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 46.6% for 2024 and 16.9% for 2023. The tax benefit recorded and increased effective tax rate for the year resulted primarily from the $1.8 billion loss on the sales of securities incurred as part of a strategic repositioning of our securities portfolio.\nIn 2024, our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, and tax credits associated with low-income housing investments, and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in Note 14 (“Income Taxes”). \nBusiness Segment Results\nThis section summarizes the financial performance of our two major business segments (operating segments): Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank. Note 25 (“Business Segment Reporting”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments. Dollars in the charts are presented in millions.\n \nConsumer Bank\nSegment imperatives\n•\nExecute a relationship-oriented growth strategy, which will enable us to grow (i) stable, low-cost deposits and (ii) valuable fee income streams, including wealth management and cards and payments\n•\nSimplify our business to improve execution and efficiency while managing risk\n•\nMeet the needs of our clients and communities in markets where we operate\nMarket and business overview\nAs the banking industry moves forward, so do our clients. Anticipating our clients’ needs not only today, but also for tomorrow and into the future, has become one of the biggest challenges for the banking industry. We view these challenges as an opportunity to help our current client base meet their own goals, as well as attract new and diverse clients. Key Consumer Bank’s focus on durable, long-term client relationships centered in core checking has been evident through the execution of our strategic priorities through focus areas such as developing a core Consumer relationship product suite and driving long-term deposits and fee income through new and enhanced products and services. Key continues to adapt to an increasingly digital world with an increased focus on client experience across our online banking channels. The advice our bankers provide, in combination with our products, services and digital platforms, place Key in a strong position to develop long-lasting and meaningful relationships with our current and prospective clients. Our goal is to help our clients move forward on their financial journeys and to be by their sides along the way. \nSummary of operations\n•\nNet income attributable to Key of $283 million in 2024, compared to $202 million in 2023, an increase of 40.1%, largely driven by favorable rates on deposits and lower FDIC special assessment charges\n•\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income increased in 2024 by $67 million, or 3.0%, from the prior year, due to favorable rates on deposits\n•\nAverage loans and leases decreased in 2024 by $3.0 billion, or 7.3%, from the prior year, driven by broad-based declines across all loan categories\n•\nAverage deposits increased in 2024 by $3.1 billion, or 3.7%, from the prior year, driven by growth in retail deposits, particularly in money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit\n60\nTable of contents\n•\nProvision for credit losses increased $15 million in 2024 compared to the prior year, driven by higher net charge-offs, partly offset by a reserve release due to changes in the portfolio and economic conditions\n•\nNoninterest income decreased in 2024 by $12 million, or 1.3%, driven by decreases in cards and payments income and service charges on deposit accounts\n•\nNoninterest expense decreased in 2024 by $67 million, or 2.4%, primarily reflective of lower FDIC special assessment charges \nCommercial Bank\nSegment imperatives\n \n•\nSolve complex client needs through a differentiated product set of banking and capital markets capabilities\n•\nDrive targeted scale through distinct product capabilities delivered to a broad set of clients\n•\nUtilize industry expertise and broad capabilities to build relationships with narrowly targeted client sets\n61\nTable of contents\nMarket and business overview\n \nBuilding relationships and delivering complex solutions for middle market clients requires a distinctive operating model that understands their business and can provide a broad set of product capabilities. As competition for these clients intensifies, we have positioned the business to maintain and grow our competitive advantage by building targeted scale in businesses and client segments. Strong market share in businesses such as real estate loan servicing and equipment finance highlights our ability to successfully meet customer needs through targeted scale in distinct product capabilities. Clients expect us to understand every aspect of their business. Our seven industry verticals are aligned to drive targeted scale in segments where we have a breadth of industry expertise. Our business model is positioned to meet our client needs because our focus is not on being a universal bank, but rather being the right bank for our clients.\nSummary of operations\n•\nNet income attributable to Key of $1.1 billion in 2024, compared to $885 million in 2023, an increase of 23.3%, largely driven by an increase in investment banking and debt placement fees and commercial mortgage servicing income, along with lower FDIC assessment charges\n•\nTaxable equivalent net interest income decreased in 2024 by $61 million, or 3.3%, from the prior year, primarily driven by a reduction in loan balances\n•\nAverage loan and lease balances decreased $7.3 billion in 2024, or 9.6%, driven by a decline in commercial and industrial loans\n•\nAverage deposit balances increased $3.0 billion in 2024, or 5.4%, driven by our focus on growing deposits across our commercial businesses\n•\nProvision for credit losses decreased $152 million in 2024 compared to the prior year, resulting from reserve releases due to changes in the portfolio and economic conditions, partially offset by higher net charge-offs\n•\nNoninterest income increased $198 million in 2024, or 13.8%, from the prior year, driven by growth in investment banking and debt placement fees and commercial mortgage servicing income \n•\nNoninterest expense increased by $28 million in 2024, or 1.6%, from the prior year, primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and other personnel expenses, partially offset by decreases in FDIC special assessment charges and operating lease expenses\n62\nTable of contents\nFinancial Condition\nLoans and loans held for sale\nFigure 7.

This portfolio is approximately \n89%\n variable rate and\n consists of loans primarily to large corporate, middle market, and small business clients.\nCommercial and industrial loans totaled $52.9 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.9 billion, or 5.2%, compared to December 31, 2023\n. The decrease was broad-based and spread across most industry categories, reflecting our planned balance sheet optimization efforts.  \n64\nTable of contents\nCommercial real estate loans\n. \nOur commercial real estate portfolio includes project loans primarily focused in market-rate and affordable multi-family housing loans, owner-occupied commercial and industrial operating company buildings, and community center grocer-anchored retail centers. These three commercial real estate segments make up 75% of our commercial real estate portfolio. Our non-owner-occupied portfolio is focused on operators of commercial real estate who not only utilize our loan products, but also our broader industry-focused products and services and provide consistent pipelines into our agency, CMBS, and other long-term market take out products. This focus ensures our relationship clients foster and build portfolios with stable, recurring cash flows, with adequate, balanced cash reserves to support our balance sheet exposures through the economic cycle. \nAt December 31, 2024, commercial real estate loans totaled $16.2 billion, which includes $13.3 billion of mortgage loans and $2.9 billion of construction loans. Compared to December 31, 2023, this portfolio decreased $2.0 billion or \n11.0%, driven mainly by decreases in nonowner-occupied. \nSince the global financial crisis in 2008, we have limited our construction business and reduced our overall construction loans from 42% to \n18%\n of commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2024. Construction loans provide a stream of funding for properties not fully leased at origination to support debt service payments over the term of the contract or project. As of December 31, 2024, 82% of our construction portfolio are multi-family project loans. Our office exposure only represents 5% of commercial real estate loans at period end. \nAs shown in Figure 10, our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes various property types and geographic locations of the underlying collateral. These loans include commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank.\n65\nTable of contents\nFigure 10.

This is followed by our home equity portfolio comprising approximately 20% of consumer loans outstanding at year end. \n66\nTable of contents\nWe held the first lien position for approximately 65% of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2024, and 64% at December 31, 2023. For loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent FICO scores as well as updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the ALLL.

These are primarily associated with commercial real estate loans administered or serviced. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 22 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”\nWe derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “Consumer mortgage income” and “Commercial mortgage servicing fees”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing loans. Additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in Note 9 (“Mortgage Servicing Assets”).\n68\nTable of contents\nMaturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates\nFigure 14 shows the remaining maturities of our loan portfolio and the sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2024. \nFigure 14.

Our securities \nportfolio totaled $45.1 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $45.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Available-for-sale securities were $37.7 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $37.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Held-to-maturity securities were $7.4 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $8.6 billion at December 31, 2023.\nAs shown in Figure 15, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques,” and Note 7 (“Securities”).\nFigure 15.

In September 2024, we initiated a strategic repositioning of our securities available for sale portfolio by selling approximately $7.0 billion in market value of low-yielding mortgage-backed securities. The investment securities that were sold had a weighted average book yield of approximately 2.3% and an average duration of approximately six years. Reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale was completed in October 2024, with the new securities having an average book yield of approximately 4.95% and an average duration of approximately four years. During the third quarter of 2024, along with our customary sale of short-dated U.S. Treasuries set to mature within the quarter, we also sold approximately $3 billion in U.S. Treasuries yielding 50 basis points that were set to mature in the fourth quarter of 2024. \nIn December 2024, we completed the strategic repositioning of our securities available-for-sale portfolio by selling an additional $3.0 billion of low-yielding investment securities and terminating approximately $3.0 billion of fair value hedges. The investment securities sold had a weighted average book yield of approximately 1.5% and an average duration of approximately eight years. Reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale was completed in December 2024, with the new securities having an average book yield of 5.5% and an average duration of approximately four years.\nFigure 16 shows the composition, TE yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

The securities being hedged are primarily U.S Treasuries, Agency RMBS, and Agency CMBS.\n(c)\nWeighted-average yields are calculated based on amortized cost. Such yields have been adjusted to a TE basis using the statutory federal income tax rate in effect that calendar year.\nHeld-to-maturity securities\nThe majority of our held-to-maturity portfolio consists of federal agency CMOs and mortgage-backed securities.

At December 31, 2024, our deposits totaled $149.8 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase reflects our durable relationship-based business model, in addition to changing client behavior as a result of higher interest rates.\n \nUninsured deposits totaled $64.4 billion and $61.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit or similar state deposit insurance regimes and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes.\nFigure 19 \npresents estimated uninsured deposits for the noted periods which reflect amounts disclosed in KeyBank’s Call Report adjusted for intercompany deposits, which are not customer facing and are eliminated in consolidation, and accrued interest.\n72\nTable of contents\nFigure 19.

The decrease reflects our balance sheet optimization efforts, which reduced our need for wholesale borrowings. For more information regarding our wholesale funds, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations under the heading “Risk Management - Liquidity risk management” of this report. \nCapital\nOur capital management objective is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and of a sufficient amount to operate under a wide range of economic conditions. Our current capital levels position us well to execute against our capital priorities including supporting organic growth and paying dividends. \nThe following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital. For further information, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Note 24 (“Shareholders' Equity”).\n(a)\nCommon Share repurchases were suspended during the second quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed in the first quarter of 2021. \nDividends\nConsistent with our capital plans, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $.205 per Common Share for each of the four quarters of 2024. These quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to $.82 per Common Share for 2024.\nCommon Shares outstanding\nOur Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 27,154 holders of record at December 31, 2024. Our book value per Common Share was $14.21 based on 1.1 billion shares outstanding at \n73\nTable of contents\nDecember 31, 2024, compared to $13.02 based on 936.6 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, our tangible book value per Common Share was $11.70, compared to $10.02 at December 31, 2023.\nFigure 21 shows activities that caused the change in our outstanding Common Shares over the past two years.\nFigure 21.

For more information on share activity, see Note 24 (“Shareholders' Equity”).  \nAt December 31, 2024, we had 149.9 million treasury shares, compared to 320.1 million treasury shares at December 31, 2023. The decrease in treasury shares during the year was primarily attributable to the issuance of 162.9 million shares to Scotiabank in connection with the strategic minority investment. Going forward, we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.\nCapital adequacy\nCapital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at December 31, 2024. Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in the “Supervision and regulation” section of Item 1 of this report. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 9.7% at December 31, 2024, compared to 7.8% at December 31, 2023. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.0% at December 31, 2024, compared to 5.1% at December 31, 2023. The minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules together with the estimated ratios of KeyCorp at December 31, 2024, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading “Basel III” in the “Supervision and Regulation” section in Item 1 of this report. \nFigure 22 represents the details of our regulatory capital positions at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, under the Regulatory Capital Rules.

Additional information regarding the nature of VIEs and our involvement with them is included in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation” and in Note 13 (“Variable Interest Entities”).\n75\nTable of contents\nCommitments to extend credit or funding\nLoan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. These commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. We typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. Since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. Further information about our loan commitments at December 31, 2024, is presented in Note 22 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees”) under the heading “Commitments to Extend Credit or Funding.” \nOther off-balance sheet arrangements\nOther off-balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset-backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. Information about such arrangements is provided in Note 22 under the heading “Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk.”\nGuarantees\nWe are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. As guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). These variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract. Additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in Note 22 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees”) under the heading “Guarantees.” \nRisk Management\nOverview\nLike all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are shown in the following chart, and we manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.\nFederal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and \n76\nTable of contents\nconform to regulatory expectations.

Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.\nMarket risk management\nMarket risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce Key’s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness, and to maximize profitability. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” and Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) in this report. \n78\nTable of contents\nTrading market risk\nKey incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. Key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, including securitization exposures. At December 31, 2024, we did not have any re-securitization positions. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk. The risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the Market Risk hedging policy. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets.\nGovernance structure - Trading market risk\nMarket risk management is an integral part of Key’s risk culture. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of trading market risks. The ERM Committee and the Market Risk Committee regularly review and discuss market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment. The Market Risk Committee approves market risk policies and recommends our significant market risk policy to the ERM Committee, the KeyBank Board, and the Risk Committee of the Board for approval. \nMTRM, as the second line of defense, is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. MTRM is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as VaR, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. MTRM conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. VaR, stressed VaR, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.\nCovered positions. \nWe monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the Market Risk Rule, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. Key’s covered positions may also include mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities that may be identified as securitization positions or re-securitization positions under the Market Risk Rule. MTRM as well as the LOB that trades securitization positions monitor the positions, the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the Market Risk policies and procedures. At December 31, 2024, covered positions did not include any re-securitization positions. Instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. MTRM is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. The Covered Position Working Group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the Market Risk Committee.\nOur significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. We analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. The descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.\n \n•\nFixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. These instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain CMOs. The activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.\n•\nInterest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. The activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.\nVaR and stressed VaR. \nVaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. MTRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR at \n79\nTable of contents\nvarious confidence levels and the results are closely monitored. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.\nWe use a historical simulation VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other non-covered positions. Historical moves in risk factors across various asset classes are incorporated in VaR metrics. Additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancellable provisions. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level.\nThe VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions. However, there are limitations inherent in the VaR model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. Historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. We regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs, and assumptions used. Our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our VaR model by Key’s internal model validation group on an annual basis. The Model Risk Committee oversees the Model Validation Program, and results of validations are discussed with the ERM Committee.\nActual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily VaR for any day during the quarters ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. MTRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. Results of back testing are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when daily held profit and loss exceed VaR. We do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.\nThe aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was $1.4 million at December 31, 2024, and $1.6 million at December 31, 2023. Figure 23 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. \nFigure 23.

The aggregate stressed VaR for all covered positions was $5.2 million at December 31, 2024, and $4.0 million at December 31, 2023. Figure 24 summarizes our stressed VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The increase in stressed VaR is due to a change in the size and composition of our fixed income inventory.\nFigure 24.

The aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the Market Risk Rule was $24 million at December 31, 2024, all of which were mortgage-backed security positions. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Market risk weighted assets, including the specific risk calculations, are run quarterly by MTRM in accordance with the Market Risk Rule, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer.\nNontrading market risk\nMost of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the Board-approved ERM policy.\nInterest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors, including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, yield curve risk, option risk, and basis risk.\n•\n“Reprice risk\n”\n is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.\n•\n“Yield curve risk”\n is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.\n•\n“Option risk”\n is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.\n•\n“Basis risk”\n is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.\nGovernance structure - Nontrading market risk\nThe management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. The ERM Committee, the ALCO, and the Treasury Risk Oversight Committee (“TROC”) review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above. In addition, the ALCO reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk. These committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The A/LM Policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. MTRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.\nNet interest income simulation analysis.\n The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. The modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with management's desired interest rate risk positioning. The simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest \n81\nTable of contents\nincome that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next 12 months (subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero).\nFigure 25 presents the results of the simulation analysis at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was relatively neutral. The exposure to declining rates has changed from (0.01)% as of December 31, 2023 to 0.15% as of December 31, 2024, as a result of the change in balance sheet mix and positioning. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. Current modeled exposure is within Board-approved tolerances. If a tolerance level is breached and determined inconsistent with risk appetite, the development of a remediation plan is required to reduce exposure back to within tolerance.\nFigure 25. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nBasis point change assumption\n-200\n200\n-200\n200\nTolerance level\n(5.50)\n%\n(5.50)\n%\n(5.50)\n%\n(5.50)\n%\nInterest rate risk assessment\n0.15\n \n%\n(0.39)\n%\n(0.01)\n%\n(2.08)\n%\nSimulation analyses produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumption inputs within the model. Assumptions are tailored to the specific interest rate environment and validated on a regular basis. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analyses due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities or repercussions from exogenous events\n.\nRegular stress tests and sensitivity analyses are performed on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. Assessments are performed using different yield curve shapes, including steepenings or flattenings of the curve, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.\nThe results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 25. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. If fixed-rate assets increase by $1 billion, or fixed-rate liabilities decrease by $1 billion, then the potential benefit to declining rates would increase by approximately 23 basis points. A five percentage point increase or decrease in the interest-bearing deposit beta assumption changes the current simulation results by approximately 120 basis points.\nThe current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. Corporate Treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.\nSimulations are also conducted that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a similar manner to those based on a 12-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, changes in the EVE are calculated as discussed in the following section.\nEconomic value of equity modeling.\n EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. EVE policy limits are measured against a +/-200 basis point scenario subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero. This analysis is highly dependent \n82\nTable of contents\nupon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as forward expectations. Remediation plans are similarly developed if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. The position is within these guidelines as of December 31, 2024.\nManagement of interest rate exposure.\n The results of the various interest rate risk analyses are used to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, risk positions are managed by purchasing or selling securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives. Interest rate swaps and options are predominantly used, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities. \nFigure 26 shows all swap positions held for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity, and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently to reflect broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how interest rate swaps are used to manage our risk profile, see Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).\nFigure 26.

Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.\nGovernance structure\nWe manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on a consolidated basis. This approach considers the funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. \nThe management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. Oversight and governance is provided by the Board, the ERM Committee, the ALCO, the TROC, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Asset Liability Management Policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the ALCO. The Corporate Treasury Oversight group within MTRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. Our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the Federal Reserve Board’s Enhanced Prudential Standards.\nThe committees mentioned above regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, internal liquidity stress tests, and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. \n83\nTable of contents\nTo ensure that emerging issues are identified, we monitor an extensive set of systematic and idiosyncratic early warning indicators daily.\nFactors affecting liquidity\nOur liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, global pandemics, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund, or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.\nOur credit ratings at December 31, 2024, are shown in Figure 27. While we believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable KeyCorp or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors, downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. \nFigure 27.

F2 assigned by Fitch Ratings, Inc. is specific to KeyBank’s short-term deposit ratings.\nManaging liquidity risk\nMost of our liquidity risk is derived from our business model, which involves taking in deposits, many of which can be withdrawn at any time, and lending them out in the form of illiquid loan assets. The assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under stressed environments. We manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board-approved policy limits.\nWe regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly internal liquidity stress test at the consolidated KeyCorp level. From time to time, we may conduct internal liquidity stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Internal liquidity stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.\nOur primary source of funding for KeyBank is customer deposits resulting in a consolidated loan-to-deposit ratio of\n \n70% as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. \nWe maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. As part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high-quality liquid assets. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. Figure 28 shows our available contingent liquidity\n at December 31, \n84\nTable of contents\n2024 and \nDecember 31, 2023. In 2024, our secured term borrowings decreased $8.5 billion from a reduction in FHLB borrowings. \nFigure 28.

However, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy.\n We use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. \nOur target loan-to-deposit ratio is around 80% (at December 31, 2024, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 70.3%), which we calculate as the sum of total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits.\nLiquidity programs\nWe have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 20 (“Long-Term Debt”), that are designed to enable KeyCorp and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. These liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the Board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.\nKeyBank had no bank note issuances during 2024. At December 31, 2024, there was $20.0 billion available for issuance under the KeyBank Bank Note Program.\nLiquidity for KeyCorp\nThe primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\nWe use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. The parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity. We generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from KeyBank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. At December 31, 2024, KeyCorp held $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, which we\n projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.\nTypically, KeyCorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank, supplemented with term debt. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. \nDuring 2024, KeyBank paid $750 million in cash dividends to KeyCorp, and during the fourth quarter of 2024, KeyBank paid no cash dividends to KeyCorp. KeyCorp issued debt of $1.0 billion in the first \n85\nTable of contents\nquarter of 2024. At December 31, 2024, KeyBank had no regulatory capacity to pay any dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval.\nOur liquidity position and recent activity\nOver the past 12 months, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased primarily due to an increase in Key's cash position. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.\nOn August 12, 2024, we entered into an Investment Agreement with Scotiabank pursuant to which Scotiabank agreed to make a strategic minority investment in KeyCorp of approximately $2.8 billion, representing approximately 14.9% pro forma common stock ownership of KeyCorp, for a fixed price of $17.17 per share. On August 30, 2024, Scotiabank completed the initial purchase of 47,829,359 of our Common Shares with an investment of approximately $821 million in gross proceeds.\nOn December 13, 2024, we announced that all necessary bank regulatory approvals had been received for completion of Scotiabank’s strategic minority investment in KeyCorp. On December 27, 2024, Scotiabank completed the final purchase of 115,042,316 of our Common Shares, contemplated under the Investment Agreement with an investment of approximately $2.0 billion. Following the Second Closing, Scotiabank owns approximately 14.9% of our common stock.\nIn conjunction with the investment from Scotiabank, we executed a strategic repositioning of our securities available-for-sale portfolio, selling $7.0 billion and $3.0 billion in market value of low-yielding investment securities in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively. The sales resulted in a total pre-tax loss of $1.8 billion. Proceeds from the sales were invested in shorter-duration, higher-yielding investment securities.\nFrom time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or common shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Additional information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this report. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\nCredit risk management\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, distribute credit risk, purchase securities, provide financial and payments products, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.\nCredit policy, approval, and evaluation\nWe manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, the KeyBank Board, and the Risk Committee of the Board for approval. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.\nOur credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business, to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority, are responsible for credit approval. Individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, however, a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.\n86\nTable of contents\nOur credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan scoring processes. \nWe maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower. \nAllowance for loan and lease losses\nWe estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.” Briefly, the ALLL estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on our historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors. The ALLL at December 31, 2024, represents our best estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. For more information, see Note 5 (“Asset Quality”). \nAs shown in Figure 29, our ALLL from continuing operations decreased by $99 million, or 6.6%, from December 31, 2023. The commercial ALLL decreased by $23 million, or 2.2%, from December 31, 2023, driven by strategic balance sheet reductions and changes in the economic outlook, partly offset by portfolio credit migration. The consumer ALLL decreased $76 million, or 17.0%, from December 31, 2023, also largely driven by balance sheet reductions and economic forecasts, including improved home price values.\nFigure 29.

Operational risk intersects with compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. This heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. While operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in KeyCorp’s ERM framework, losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, or harm to our reputation.\nWe seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of \n90\nTable of contents\noperational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board.\nThe Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for Key. The Compliance Risk Management Program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee and the Compliance Risk Committee support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. Both the Operational Risk Committee and the Compliance Risk Committee include attendees from each of the Three Lines of Defense. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. These committees and the Operational Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management functions are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management Programs and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee and updates the Risk Committee, as appropriate, on matters related to the oversight of these controls.\nCybersecurity \nFor information on our cybersecurity risk management and governance practices, please see Item 1C. Cybersecurity of this report.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not\naudited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company,\nthey have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for analyses\nof results as reported under GAAP.\nThe tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. \n91\nTable of contents\nYear ended December 31,\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTangible common equity to tangible assets at period end\nKey shareholders’ equity (GAAP)\n$\n18,176\n \n$\n14,637 \n$\n13,454 \nLess:\nIntangible assets\n (a)\n2,779\n \n2,806 \n2,844 \nPreferred Stock \n(b)\n2,446\n \n2,446 \n2,446 \nTangible common equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n12,951\n \n$\n9,385 \n$\n8,164 \nTotal assets (GAAP)\n$\n187,168\n \n$\n188,281 \n$\n189,813 \nLess:\nIntangible assets \n(a)\n2,779\n \n2,806 \n2,844 \nTangible assets (non-GAAP)\n$\n184,389\n \n$\n185,475 \n$\n186,969 \nTangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (non-GAAP)\n7.02\n \n%\n5.06 \n%\n4.37 \n%\nAverage tangible common equity\nAverage Key shareholders’ equity (GAAP)\n$\n15,408\n \n$\n13,881 \n$\n14,730 \nLess:\nIntangible assets (average) \n(c)\n2,793\n \n2,826 \n2,839 \nPreferred Stock (average)\n2,500\n \n2,500 \n2,114 \nAverage tangible common equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n10,115\n \n$\n8,555 \n$\n9,777 \nReturn on average tangible common equity from continuing operations\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n(306)\n$\n821 \n$\n1,793 \nAverage tangible common equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n10,115\n \n$\n8,555 \n$\n9,777 \nReturn on average tangible common equity from continuing operations (non-GAAP)\n(3.03)\n%\n9.60 \n%\n18.34 \n%\nReturn on average tangible common equity consolidated\nNet income (loss) attributable to Key common shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n(304)\n$\n824 \n$\n1,799 \nAverage tangible common equity (non-GAAP)\n10,115\n \n8,555 \n9,777 \nReturn on average tangible common equity consolidated (non-GAAP)\n(3.01)\n%\n9.63 \n%\n18.40 \n%\n(a)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, intangible assets exclude less than $1 million, $1 million, and  $2 million, respectively, of period-end purchased credit card relationships.\n(b)\nNet of capital surplus.\n(c)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, average intangible assets exclude less than $1 million, $1 million, and $2 million, respectively, of average purchased credit card relationships.\nAdjusted noninterest expense and adjusted noninterest income are non-GAAP measures in that they are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain items.

Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.\nIn our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  The following is a description of our current critical accounting policies. \n92\nTable of contents\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them. We have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality, quantity, and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances. These evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change, and include, among others:\n•\nPD,\n•\nLGD,\n•\nOutstanding balance of the loan,\n•\nMovement through delinquency stages,\n•\nAmounts and timing of expected future cash flows,\n•\nValue of collateral, which may be obtained from third parties,\n•\nEconomic forecasts which are obtained from a third party provider, and\n•\nQualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in modeled results.\nAs described in our accounting policy related to the ALLL in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) of this report under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,\" we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our ALLL, which has three main components: (i) asset specific / individual loan reserves; (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves; and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. \nWe use a non-DCF factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component PD/LGD/EAD models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios. Probability of default models estimate the likelihood a borrower will cease making payments as agreed. These models use observed loan-level information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables. Borrower credit attributes including FICO scores of consumers and internally assigned risk ratings for commercial borrowers are significant inputs to the models. Consumer FICO scores are refreshed quarterly and commercial risk ratings are updated annually with select borrowers updated more frequently. The macroeconomic trends that have a significant impact on the probability of default vary by portfolio segment. Exposure at default models estimate the loan balance at the time of default. We use an amortization based formulaic approach to estimate account level EAD for all term loans. We use portfolio specific methods in each of our revolving product portfolios. LGD models estimate the loss we will suffer once a loan is in default. Account level inputs to LGD models include collateral attributes, such as loan to value.\nIf we observe limitations in the data or models, we use model overlays to make adjustments to model outputs to capture a particular risk or compensate for a known limitation. These variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts.\nThis estimate produced by our models is forward-looking and requires management to use forecasts about future economic conditions to determine the expected credit loss over the remaining life of an instrument. Moody’s Consensus forecast is our source of macroeconomic projections, including the interest rate forecasts used in the credit models. We use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products to forecast economic conditions. As the length of the life of a financial asset increases, these inputs may become impractical to estimate as reasonable and supportable. We believe the two year time horizon appropriately aligns with our business planning, available industry guidance, and reliability of various forecasting services. Following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated, for all modeled loan portfolios, we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables (model inputs) to their long run average. We revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios.\nA four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period. We use a 20 year lookback period for determining long run historical average of the macroeconomic variables. We determined the 20 year lookback period is appropriate as it captures the previous two economic cycles as well as the impact from the pandemic.\nThe ALLL is sensitive to various macroeconomic drivers such as GDP and unemployment as well as portfolio attributes such as remaining term, outstanding balance, risk ratings, FICO, LTV, and delinquency status. Our ALLL models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes. As such, evaluating \n93\nTable of contents\nshifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall ALLL because we consider a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the ALLL. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast, we compare the modeled quantitative allowance results using a downside economic scenario. The maximum difference in the quarterly macroeconomic variables between the base and downside scenarios over the two year reasonable and supportable period includes an approximate 5 percentage point decline in GDP annualized growth and an approximate 4 percentage point increase in the U.S. unemployment rate. The difference between these two scenarios would have driven an increase of approximately 1.6x for commercial and 1.7x for the consumer modeled allowance results.\nSimilarly, deteriorating conditions for portfolio factors were also considered by moderately stressing key portfolio drivers, relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. Stressing risk ratings by two ratings for commercial loans generates a 1.5x increase in the commercial modeled allowance results. Stressing FICO by ten points, and LTV and utilization by 10% for consumer loans generates a 1.2x increase in the consumer modeled allowance results.\nNote that these analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the ALLL to key quantitative assumptions, but exclude potential impacts to non-modeled allowance components and reserves for individually assessed loans. Furthermore, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall ALLL as they do not reflect qualitative factors, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, and other relevant factors that must be considered to ensure the ALLL reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses. \nValuation methodologies\nFair value measurements\nWe measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. While management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to “normal” market activity, management’s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. \nA fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs. Fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on our specific data (Level 3 valuations). Unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.\nThe selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value. Considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value.\nFor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there\n94\nTable of contents\nis an active market. In certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not\nbe readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use\nin estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. The models used to determine fair value adjustments are\nregularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances.\nChanges in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.\nFair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of\naccounting. Fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities (including held-to-maturity securities, commercial loans held for sale, and OREO) for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance.\nImpairment analysis also relates to long-lived assets and core deposit and other intangible assets. An\nimpairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair\nvalue. In determining the fair value, management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions\npreviously discussed.\nSee Note 1 under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” and Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes.\nGoodwill\nThe valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in Note 1 \nunder the heading “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment for all three of our reporting units: Consumer Bank, Commercial Bank and Institutional Bank. We perform our annual impairment test as of October 1st and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing is needed. Testing may be either quantitative or qualitative. Fair value is measured during quantitative tests using a combination of income and market approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit declines below its carrying value, an impairment charge will be recognized for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, to the extent that the loss recognized does not exceed the amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. When utilizing the qualitative testing approach, Key examines numerous qualitative factors such as financial performance, market capitalization and other industry and economic trends to conclude whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2024, we realigned our real estate capital business from our Commercial Bank reporting unit to our Institutional Bank reporting unit. The move was done to align product-based teams to the client-facing businesses they serve with the goal of reducing overhead and complexity and creating a better client experience. Additionally, due to the realignment, a portion of goodwill was reallocated from our Commercial Bank reporting unit to our Institutional Bank reporting unit immediately after the realignment based on the relative fair value of the transferred business. This realignment was identified as a triggering event for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. As a result, interim goodwill impairment tests were performed during the first quarter of 2024 reflecting the reporting units both immediately before and immediately after the realignment, neither of which resulted in impairment. \nThe quantitative test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach (weighted 50%) and two market based approaches: the publicly traded company approach (weighted 25%) and the recent transactions approach (weighted 25%). For the market based approaches, valuations of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples based on either public companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit or actual prices paid from recent transactions. Since the fair values determined under the market approaches are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations incorporated a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit.\nThe inputs and assumptions utilized for the valuation of each reporting unit include projections of future cash flows, discount rates, valuation multiples of comparable public companies, and recent transaction information. Future cash \n95\nTable of contents\nflows are based on multi-year forecasts for each reporting unit and include inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and required capital. A terminal growth rate is estimated for each reporting unit based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry. Discount rates are developed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”) which considers a risk free rate, 5-year adjusted beta based on peer companies, a market equity risk premium, a size premium, and a company specific risk premium. The discount rates used for the Consumer, Commercial, and Institutional reporting units were, 13%, 13.5%, and 13.5%, respectively.\nThe results of the interim quantitative goodwill impairment tests indicated that the fair values of the Consumer, Commercial and Institutional Bank reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values both immediately prior to and immediately after the realignment, therefore, there was no goodwill impairment. The fair values of the Consumer Bank and Commercial Bank reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values by greater than 10% immediately prior to the realignment. However, for the Institutional Bank reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 4% prior to the reporting unit realignment. The fair values of all reporting units were in excess of their carrying values by greater than 10% immediately after the realignment.\nThe combined fair value of all reporting units immediately before and immediately after the realignment was considered reasonable by comparison to Key's market capitalization. The estimated fair values of each reporting unit are sensitive to changes in management’s estimates and assumptions. Changes in the estimates and assumptions could result in instances in which the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We performed sensitivity analyses around certain assumptions to assess their reasonableness and impact on the reporting units’ fair values. The analysis of the Institutional Bank reporting unit immediately before the realignment indicated that if the discount rate utilized in the income approach was increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have decreased or increased approximately 4%, respectively. If the net interest margin utilized in the income approach was increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have increased or decreased by approximately 19%, respectively, with a decrease resulting in impairment of goodwill recorded at the Institutional Bank reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult to estimate over such an extended time frame. In the future, changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could produce a material non-cash goodwill impairment. The results of the impairment test after the realignment, however, indicated the fair value of each of the three reporting units, Consumer, Commercial, and Institutional, exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 10%. The estimated fair value of the Consumer Bank reporting unit was 18% greater than its carrying amount, the estimated fair value of the Commercial Bank reporting unit was 25% greater than its carrying amount, and the estimated fair value of the Institutional Bank reporting unit was 34% greater than its carrying amount.\nWe performed an annual qualitative impairment test for all three of our reporting units as of October 1, 2024. This test involved reviewing updated internal forecasts, evaluating market data, assessing reasonableness of critical assumptions used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test and considering recent transactions and events that could impact the goodwill at each reporting unit. Key concluded it was not more likely than not that goodwill was impaired as of October 1, 2024, our annual testing date.\nAdditionally, we monitored events and circumstances during the period from October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, Key specific performance indicators, and updated management forecasts. Based on these considerations, we concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of the reporting units was below its respective carrying value as of December 31, 2024.  \nAdditional information is provided in Note 12 (“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”).\nDerivatives and hedging\nWe primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. These derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. Accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.\n96\nTable of contents\nThe application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. We believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. Additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in Note 1 under the heading “Derivatives and Hedging,” and Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).\nContingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes\nNote 22 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees”) summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations. We record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee. Contingent aspects of guarantees within the scope of ASC 326 are assessed a reserve under CECL. There is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. See Note 22 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees”) for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at December 31, 2024.\nIt is not always clear how the Internal Revenue Code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. In the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the IRS or state tax authorities. We have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. However, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital.\nAdditionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. The available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes a history of pretax income, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. These assessments are subjective and may change. Based on these criteria, and all available positive and negative evidence, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized. However, if our assessments prove incorrect, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur. For further information on our accounting for income taxes, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) and Note 14 (“Income Taxes”).\n97\nTable of contents\nAccounting and reporting developments \n \nThe following table presents accounting guidance pending adoption.\nStandard\nRequired Adoption \nDescription\nEffect on Financial Statements or \nOther Significant Matters\nASU 2023-06\nDisclosure\nImprovements\nThe date on which the SEC’s removal of related\ndisclosures from\nRegulation S-X or\nRegulation S-K becomes effective.\nEarly adoption is\nprohibited.\nThis guidance clarifies and improves disclosure requirements for a variety of topics to align with the SEC's regulations.\nThe amendments should be applied prospectively.\nThe guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Key’s disclosures.\nASU 2024-03\nIncome Statement—Reporting Comprehensive \nIncome—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Topic 220-40)\nJanuary 1, 2027\nEarly adoption is permitted.\nThe guidance requires public companies disclose additional information about certain types of costs and expenses.\nThe guidance should be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis.\nThe guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Key’s disclosures.\nASU 2024-04\nDebt—Debt with Conversion and\nOther Options (Topic 470-20)\nJanuary 1, 2026\nEarly adoption is permitted.\nThe guidance clarifies criteria to determine whether a settlement of a convertible debt instrument should be accounted for as an induced conversion. \nThe guidance should be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis.\nThe guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Key’s disclosures.",
