Except for the historical financial information, this Report may include statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” under the United States (U.S.) securities laws. Forward-looking statements include information concerning future results of our operations, expenses, earnings, liquidity, cash flow, capital expenditures, and AUM that could differ materially from actual results due to known and unknown risks and other important factors, including, but not limited to, industry or market conditions, geopolitical events including wars, global trade tensions, tariffs, natural disasters, and pandemics or health crises and their respective potential impact on the company, acquisitions and divestitures, debt and our ability to obtain additional financing or make payments, regulatory developments, demand for and pricing of our products, the prospects for certain legal contingencies, and other aspects of our business or general economic conditions. In addition, when used in this Report or such other documents or statements, words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” and future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” and “would” as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. None of this information should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, historical financial statements.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees, and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations. We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge them to carefully consider the risks described in this Report and our most recent Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nYou may obtain these reports from the SEC’s website at \nwww.sec.gov\n. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information in any public disclosure if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate.\nReferences\nIn this Report, unless otherwise specified, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “company,” “firm,” and “Invesco” refer to Invesco Ltd., a company incorporated in Bermuda, and its consolidated entities.\nExecutive Overview\nThe following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management’s discussion and analysis and supplements should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. The company’s financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, as discussed in the “Results of Operations” section as applicable.\nThe company is an independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering a superior investment experience. Our comprehensive range of active, passive and alternative investment capabilities has been constructed over many years to help clients achieve their investment objectives. We draw on this comprehensive range of capabilities to provide solutions designed to deliver key outcomes aligned to client needs. One of Invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our diversification across investment capabilities, distribution channels and geographies. This broad diversification helps to mitigate some of the impact of different market cycles on Invesco and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels.\n17\n \nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes returns based on price appreciation/(depreciation) of several major market indices for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\nEquity Indices - Domestic\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nS&P 500\n7.8%\n5.5%\n13.7%\n20.8%\nS&P 500 Equal-Weight \n4.4%\n9.1%\n8.4%\n13.5%\nS&P 500 Growth \n9.6%\n3.6%\n18.9%\n27.5%\nS&P 500 Value\n5.7%\n8.4%\n8.1%\n13.4%\nNASDAQ 100 \n8.8%\n1.9%\n17.5%\n19.2%\nEquity Indices - Global\nFTSE 100 (local currency)\n6.7%\n0.9%\n14.4%\n6.5%\nMSCI AC Asia Pacific\n8.5%\n8.1%\n21.5%\n15.1%\nMSCI China (local currency)\n19.0%\n21.3%\n38.9%\n25.5%\nMSCI Emerging Markets\n10.1%\n7.8%\n25.2%\n14.4%\nMSCI Europe (local currency)\n3.2%\n2.0%\n9.9%\n9.0%\nMSCI Japan (local currency)\n9.6%\n(6.7)%\n11.3%\n12.0%\nFixed Income Indices\nBloomberg US Aggregate Bond\n2.0%\n5.2%\n6.1%\n4.5%\nBloomberg Global Aggregated Bond (local currency)\n1.0%\n4.0%\n3.7%\n3.5%\nBloomberg China Aggregated Bond \n(0.2)%\n4.7%\n2.6%\n6.2%\n    \nFinancial markets ended the third quarter with strong momentum as key indices reached new highs. This favorable environment broadened investor demand across product lines, culminating in $2.1 trillion in AUM in the third quarter of 2025 with net long-term inflows of $28.9 billion - an annualized organic growth rate of 7.9%. \nWe remain prudent and diligent in our approach to capital management. Our priorities are balanced with a focus on supporting future growth and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet, while returning excess cash to shareholders. In addition to paying a $0.21 dividend per common share during the third quarter of 2025, the company repurchased 1.2 million common shares for $25 million in the open market. Additionally, in the third quarter, we repaid $260 million of the $500 million three-year bank term loan due on May 16, 2028 and repaid the remaining balance of $240 million in October 2025. We ended the quarter with a zero balance on our Revolving credit agreement.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we entered into an agreement to sell intelliflo, our cloud-based practice management software business. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, on October 31, 2025, we completed the sale of 60% of our interest in our wholly owned subsidiary, Invesco Asset Management (India) Private Limited, to IndusInd International Holdings Limited.\n18\n \nTable of Contents\nPresentation of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of Consolidated Investment Products\nThe company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, investment products sponsored by the company in the normal course of business. The company's investment adviser subsidiaries serve as investment managers to these products, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this Report as CIP. The company’s economic risk with respect to each investment in CIP is limited to its equity ownership, unfunded equity commitments and any uncollected management and performance fees. See also Note 11, \"Consolidated Investment Products,\" for additional information regarding the impact of the consolidation of managed funds.\nThe majority of the company’s CIP balances are related to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs beyond the company’s direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider these assets to be company assets. Likewise, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.\nDue to the significant impact that CIP has on the presentation of the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-GAAP disclosures (among other adjustments). See \"Schedule of Non-GAAP Information\" for additional information regarding these adjustments. The following discussion therefore combines the results presented under U.S. GAAP with the company’s non-GAAP presentation.\n19\n \nTable of Contents\nSummary Operating Information\nWherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense and other income and expense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented.\nSummary operating information for three and nine months ended\n September 30, 2025\n and 2024 is presented in the table below:\n(in millions, other than per common share amounts, operating margins and AUM)\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\nU.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOperating revenues\n$\n1,640.4 \n$\n1,515.4 \n$\n4,685.1 \n$\n4,474.0 \nOperating income\n$\n270.9 \n$\n100.5 \n$\n762.4 \n$\n520.4 \nOperating margin\n16.5 \n%\n6.6 \n%\n16.3 \n%\n11.6 \n%\nNet income attributable to Invesco Ltd.\n$\n301.3 \n$\n55.0 \n$\n459.9 \n$\n328.7 \nDiluted EPS\n$\n0.66 \n$\n0.12 \n$\n1.01 \n$\n0.72 \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Summary\n(1)\nNet revenues \n$\n1,186.3 \n$\n1,104.3 \n$\n3,399.6 \n$\n3,243.3 \nAdjusted operating income \n$\n406.1 \n$\n348.8 \n$\n1,100.0 \n$\n980.6 \nAdjusted operating margin \n34.2 \n%\n31.6 \n%\n32.4 \n%\n30.2 \n%\nAdjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.\n$\n275.4 \n$\n199.8 \n$\n641.1 \n$\n544.4 \nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n0.61 \n$\n0.44 \n$\n1.41 \n$\n1.19 \nAssets Under Management \nEnding AUM (billions)\n$\n2,124.8 \n$\n1,795.6 \n$\n2,124.8 \n$\n1,795.6 \nAverage AUM (billions)\n$\n2,060.4 \n$\n1,742.0 \n$\n1,946.2 \n$\n1,674.8 \n_________\n(1)\nNet revenues, Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin), and Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.

Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision.\nAUM measured in the one, three and five year quartile rankings represents 35%, 35% and 35% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one, three and five year basis represents 45%, 45%, and 44% of total Invesco AUM as of 9/30/2025. Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third-party ranking agency in each fund’s market (Morningstar, IA, Lipper, eVestment, Mercer, Galaxy, SITCA, Value Research) and asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and prior month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings are calculated against all funds in each peer group. Rankings for the primary share class of the most representative fund in each composite are applied to all products within each composite. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor’s experience.\n21\n \nTable of Contents\nAssets Under Management\nThe following presentation and discussion of AUM includes Passive and Active AUM. Passive AUM includes index-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), UITs, non-management fee earning AUM and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM. Non-management fee earning AUM includes non-management fee earning ETFs, UITs and product leverage. \nMovements in global capital market levels, net inflows (or outflows), and changes in the mix of investment products between and within asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period.\nThe AUM tables and the discussion below refer to certain AUM as long-term. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds. Long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital upon maturity. We present net flows into money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and the flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements.\nChanges in Active and Passive AUM were as follows:\nThree months ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n (in billions)\nTotal AUM\nActive\nPassive\nTotal AUM\nActive\nPassive\nBeginning Assets (July 1)\n$\n2,001.4 \n$\n1,087.5 \n$\n913.9 \n$\n1,715.8 \n$\n1,003.3 \n$\n712.5 \nLong-term inflows \n138.4 \n76.4 \n62.0 \n107.2 \n49.3 \n57.9 \nLong-term outflows\n(109.5)\n(69.5)\n(40.0)\n(90.7)\n(49.9)\n(40.8)\nNet long-term flows\n28.9 \n6.9 \n22.0 \n16.5 \n(0.6)\n17.1 \nNet flows in non-management fee earning AUM\n2.6 \n— \n2.6 \n3.5 \n— \n3.5 \nNet flows in money market funds\n(5.4)\n(5.4)\n— \n(7.3)\n(7.3)\n— \nTotal net flows\n26.1 \n1.5 \n24.6 \n12.7 \n(7.9)\n20.6 \nReinvested distributions\n1.0 \n1.0 \n— \n1.0 \n1.0 \n— \nMarket gains and losses\n99.0 \n29.4 \n69.6 \n49.8 \n21.6 \n28.2 \nForeign currency translation\n(2.7)\n(2.8)\n0.1 \n16.3 \n14.3 \n2.0 \nEnding Assets (September 30)\n$\n2,124.8 \n$\n1,116.6 \n$\n1,008.2 \n$\n1,795.6 \n$\n1,032.3 \n$\n763.3 \nAverage AUM\nAverage long-term AUM\n$\n1,462.0 \n$\n878.6 \n$\n583.4 \n$\n1,257.2 \n$\n820.4 \n$\n436.8 \nAverage AUM\n$\n2,060.4 \n$\n1,102.5 \n$\n957.9 \n$\n1,742.0 \n$\n1,007.4 \n$\n734.6 \nAverage QQQ AUM\n$\n365.1 \nN/A\n$\n365.1 \n$\n288.1 \nN/A\n$\n288.1 \n22\n \nTable of Contents\nNine months ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n (in billions)\nTotal AUM\nActive\nPassive\nTotal AUM\nActive\nPassive\nBeginning Assets (January 1)\n$\n1,846.0 \n$\n1,026.5 \n$\n819.5 \n$\n1,585.3 \n$\n985.3 \n$\n600.0 \nLong-term inflows \n379.1 \n196.6 \n182.5 \n285.3 \n141.4 \n143.9 \nLong-term outflows\n(317.0)\n(184.4)\n(132.6)\n(245.8)\n(146.8)\n(99.0)\nNet long-term flows\n62.1 \n12.2 \n49.9 \n39.5 \n(5.4)\n44.9 \nNet flows in non-management fee earning AUM\n10.4 \n— \n10.4 \n19.6 \n— \n19.6 \nNet flows in money market funds\n1.4 \n1.4 \n— \n(1.7)\n(1.7)\n— \nTotal net flows\n73.9 \n13.6 \n60.3 \n57.4 \n(7.1)\n64.5 \nReinvested distributions\n3.0 \n3.0 \n— \n3.5 \n3.5 \n— \nMarket gains and losses\n183.2 \n58.7 \n124.5 \n145.2 \n47.0 \n98.2 \nForeign currency translation\n18.7 \n14.8 \n3.9 \n4.2 \n3.6 \n0.6 \nEnding Assets (September 30)\n$\n2,124.8 \n$\n1,116.6 \n$\n1,008.2 \n$\n1,795.6 \n$\n1,032.3 \n$\n763.3 \nAverage AUM\nAverage long-term AUM\n$\n1,377.5 \n$\n842.1 \n$\n535.4 \n$\n1,207.3 \n$\n802.4 \n$\n404.9 \nAverage AUM\n$\n1,946.2 \n$\n1,066.5 \n$\n879.7 \n$\n1,674.8 \n$\n994.3 \n$\n680.5 \nAverage QQQ AUM\n$\n334.8 \nN/A\n$\n334.8 \n$\n266.0 \nN/A\n$\n266.0 \nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRevenue yield (bps) \n(1)\nU.S. GAAP Gross revenue yield\n33.7\n36.7\n33.9\n37.6\nNet revenue yield ex performance fees ex QQQ \n(2)\n27.7\n30.3\n27.9\n30.4\nActive net revenue yield ex performance fees\n35.3\n37.0\n35.1\n36.8\nPassive net revenue yield ex QQQ \n(2)\n13.7\n15.0\n13.9\n15.1\n \n________\n(1)    \nU.S. GAAP Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to U.S. GAAP annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (Invesco Great Wall or IGW) AUM. The average AUM for IGW in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $113.7 billion and $103.3 billion (three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: $90.0 billion and $87.0 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of IGW as the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our Operating revenues. The U.S. GAAP Gross revenue yield is not a good measure because the numerator excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Net revenue yield metrics include the Net revenues and Average AUM of IGW and CIP. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of Operating revenues to Net revenues.\n(2)    Performance fees are earned when certain performance metrics are achieved; Invesco QQQ Trust does not earn net revenues. Therefore, net revenue yield is calculated excluding performance fees and Invesco QQQ Trust AUM. Passive net revenue yield is calculated excluding Invesco QQQ Trust AUM.\n23\n \nTable of Contents\nFlows\nThere are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investments, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients, and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors’ decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows.\nMarket Returns\nMarket gains and losses include the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period. The table in the “Executive Overview” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis summarizes returns based on price appreciation/(depreciation) of several major market indices for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nForeign Exchange Rates\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we experienced a decrease in AUM of $2.7 billion and an increase in AUM of $18.7 billion, respectively, due to changes in foreign exchange rates (three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, AUM  increased by $16.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively).\n24\n

Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net inflows (or outflows), and changes in the mix of investment products between and within asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. See the company’s disclosures regarding the changes in AUM during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 in the “Assets Under Management” section above for additional information. In addition, as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to the mix of AUM between geographies and exchange rates have an impact on revenues and net revenue yields.\nAverage AUM was $1,946.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $1,674.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As secular shifts in client demand continue, our broad set of investment capabilities have allowed us to capture evolving client product preferences, including products that have lower net revenue yields. As a result, net revenue yield excluding performance fees and Invesco QQQ Trust declined to 27.9 basis points (bps) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from 30.4 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n \n \n33\n \nTable of Contents\nInvestment Management Fees\nInvestment management fees were $1,184.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $1,100.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by $13.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. After allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees increased by $71.2 million as a result of higher average AUM partially offset by the impacts of secular shifts in client demand which have altered our asset mix. See discussion above on how AUM changes impact our Investment management fees. \nInvestment management fees were $3,385.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $3,215.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by $19.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. After allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees increased by $151.1 million as a result of higher average AUM partially offset by the impacts of secular shifts in client demand which have altered our asset mix. See discussion above on how AUM changes impact our Investment management fees. \nService and Distribution Fees\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, Service and distribution fees were $400.7 million as compared to $360.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher distribution fees of $39.8 million resulting from higher AUM.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Service and distribution fees were $1,135.4 million as compared to $1,098.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by higher distribution fees of $59.5 million resulting from higher average AUM, partially offset by lower administrative fees of $24.5 million resulting from lower fund-related service fees.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees were $6.5 million and $12.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and were primarily generated from private markets products. \nPerformance fees were $2.8 million and $12.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and were primarily generated from private markets products.\nOther Revenues\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, Other revenues were $48.5 million as compared to $51.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Other revenues were $151.2 million as compared to $147.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \nInvesco Great Wall\nThe company’s most significant joint venture is our investment in IGW. The company reflects 100% of IGW's results in its Net revenues and Adjusted operating expenses because it is important to evaluate the contribution that IGW is making to the business. The company’s non-GAAP operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying AUM and flows. Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of Net revenues.\n34\n \nTable of Contents\nNet revenues from IGW were $94.3 million and average AUM was $113.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025 (Net revenues were $76.9 million and average AUM was $90.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024).  The increase in IGW revenues was primarily due to higher average AUM.\nNet revenues from IGW were $251.7 million and average AUM was $103.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 (Net revenues were $237.7 million and average AUM was $87.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024). The increase in IGW revenue was primarily due to higher average AUM.\nCIP\nManagement believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust Operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating Net revenues. As Management and Performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these Operating revenues back in the calculation of Net revenues. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of Net revenues. \nManagement and Performance fees earned from CIP were $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 (three months ended September 30, 2024: $11.6 million).\nManagement and Performance fees earned from CIP were $30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $30.6 million).\n35\n \nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nThe main categories of Operating expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory\n$\n558.3 \n$\n499.6 \n$\n58.7 \n11.7 \n%\n$\n1,568.0 \n$\n1,499.0 \n$\n69.0 \n4.6 \n%\nEmployee compensation\n521.6 \n625.4 \n(103.8)\n(16.6)\n%\n1,496.6 \n1,550.4 \n(53.8)\n(3.5)\n%\nMarketing\n20.1 \n18.9 \n1.2 \n6.3 \n%\n60.2 \n57.6 \n2.6 \n4.5 \n%\nProperty, office and technology\n109.2 \n119.0 \n(9.8)\n(8.2)\n%\n341.3 \n353.0 \n(11.7)\n(3.3)\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n151.3 \n140.8 \n10.5 \n7.5 \n%\n427.8 \n459.7 \n(31.9)\n(6.9)\n%\nAmortization of intangibles \n9.0 \n11.2 \n(2.2)\n(19.6)\n%\n28.8 \n33.9 \n(5.1)\n(15.0)\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n1,369.5 \n$\n1,414.9 \n$\n(45.4)\n(3.2)\n%\n$\n3,922.7 \n$\n3,953.6 \n$\n(30.9)\n(0.8)\n%\nThe table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total Operating expenses and Operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense.\n(in millions)\nThree months ended September 30, 2025\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Total Operating Revenues\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Total Operating Revenues\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory\n$\n558.3 \n40.8 \n%\n34.0 \n%\n$\n499.6 \n35.3 \n%\n33.0 \n%\nEmployee compensation\n521.6\n38.1 \n%\n31.8 \n%\n625.4 \n44.2 \n%\n41.3 \n%\nMarketing\n20.1\n1.4 \n%\n1.2 \n%\n18.9 \n1.3 \n%\n1.2 \n%\nProperty, office and technology\n109.2\n8.0 \n%\n6.7 \n%\n119.0 \n8.4 \n%\n7.9 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n151.3\n11.0 \n%\n9.2 \n%\n140.8 \n10.0 \n%\n9.3 \n%\nAmortization of intangibles \n9.0\n0.7 \n%\n0.6 \n%\n11.2 \n0.8 \n%\n0.7 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n1,369.5 \n100.0 \n%\n83.5 \n%\n$\n1,414.9 \n100.0 \n%\n93.4 \n%\n(in millions)\nNine months ended September 30, 2025\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Total Operating Revenues\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Total Operating Revenues\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory\n$\n1,568.0 \n40.0 \n%\n33.5 \n%\n$\n1,499.0 \n37.9 \n%\n33.5 \n%\nEmployee compensation\n1,496.6 \n38.2 \n%\n31.9 \n%\n1,550.4 \n39.2 \n%\n34.7 \n%\nMarketing\n60.2\n1.5 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n57.6 \n1.5 \n%\n1.3 \n%\nProperty, office and technology\n341.3\n8.7 \n%\n7.3 \n%\n353.0 \n8.9 \n%\n7.9 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n427.8\n10.9 \n%\n9.1 \n%\n459.7 \n11.6 \n%\n10.3 \n%\nAmortization of intangibles \n28.8\n0.7 \n%\n0.6 \n%\n33.9 \n0.9 \n%\n0.8 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n3,922.7 \n100.0 \n%\n83.7 \n%\n$\n3,953.6 \n100.0 \n%\n88.4 \n%\n During the three months ended September 30, 2025, Operating expenses decreased $45.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The increase was due to an increase in Investment management fees and pass-through Service and distribution costs resulting from higher average AUM. \nThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses were $1,568.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $1,499.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to an increase in Investment management fees and pass-through Service and distribution costs resulting from higher average AUM. \nEmployee Compensation\nEmployee compensation was $521.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $625.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a one-time acceleration of $147.6 million in expense during the third quarter of 2024 resulting from changes to the retirement criteria for vesting of outstanding common share-based awards and other long-term awards (collectively, Long-term awards), partially offset by higher benefits and other compensation costs of $13.9 million and higher variable compensation costs of $29.2 million primarily driven by improved operating results. \nEmployee compensation was $1,496.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $1,550.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased Employee compensation by $8.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, there was a decrease in Employee compensation of $61.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to the above noted acceleration of expense for outstanding Long-term awards of $147.6 million during 2024, partially offset by $16.9 million of severance expense related to the reorganization of the fundamental equities investment teams, an increase of $12.5 million in benefits and other compensation costs, and an increase of $55.4 million in variable compensation costs primarily driven by improved operating results.\nHeadcount at September 30, 2025 was 8,368 (September 30, 2024: 8,524).\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses were $20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. \nMarketing expenses were $60.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $57.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \nProperty, Office and Technology\nProperty, office and technology expenses were $109.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $119.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due to lower property and office costs of $5.2 million as well as lower technology costs of $4.6 million. \nProperty, office and technology expenses were $341.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $353.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower property and office costs. \nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $151.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $140.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher costs of $14.6 million related to newly launched CIP, partially offset by lower professional fees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $427.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $459.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the expense related to the accrual of a $50 million liability related to the settlement of certain regulatory matters in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by higher costs of $27.9 million related to newly launched CIP. The decrease was also driven by lower professional fees.\n37\n \nTable of Contents\nOther Income and Expenses\nThe main categories of Other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n$\n34.8 \n$\n2.1 \n$\n32.7 \n1,557.1 \n%\n$\n79.4 \n$\n22.9 \n$\n56.5 \n246.7 \n%\nInterest and dividend income\n10.5 \n10.9 \n(0.4)\n(3.7)\n%\n32.3 \n34.3 \n(2.0)\n(5.8)\n%\nInterest expense\n(25.7)\n(13.4)\n(12.3)\n91.8 \n%\n(59.5)\n(45.6)\n(13.9)\n30.5 \n%\nOther gains and losses, net\n(0.8)\n28.3 \n(29.1)\n(102.8)\n%\n34.6 \n67.8 \n(33.2)\n(49.0)\n%\nOther income/(expense) of CIP, net\n57.0 \n16.7 \n40.3 \n241.3 \n%\n116.8 \n88.1 \n28.7 \n32.6 \n%\nTotal other income and expenses\n$\n75.8 \n$\n44.6 \n$\n31.2 \n70.0 \n%\n$\n203.6 \n$\n167.5 \n$\n36.1 \n21.6 \n%\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates \nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to $34.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings from our private markets investments and our joint venture investment in IGW.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to $79.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings from our private markets investments and our joint venture investment in IGW.\nInterest and dividend income\nInterest and dividend income was $10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nInterest and dividend income was $32.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $25.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.  The three months ended September 30, 2025 includes interest expense related to the new bank term loans entered into on May 16, 2025.\nInterest expense was $59.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $45.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes interest expense related to the new bank term loans entered into on May 16, 2025.\nOther gains and losses, net\nOther gain and losses, net was a loss of $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to a net gain of $28.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by a $35.9 million non-cash impairment charge due to the reclassification of our intelliflo business to held for sale related to the previously announced agreement to sell the business which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by net market gains of $32.6 million on deferred compensation related investments, hedging instruments, and seed capital investments. \nOther gain and losses, net was a gain of $34.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to a net gain of $67.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included net market gains of $57.0 million on deferred compensation related investments and hedging instruments and $11.5 million on other investments, partially offset by the above noted non-cash impairment charge of $35.9 million related to the planned sale of the intelliflo business. \n38\n \nTable of Contents\nOther income/(expense) of CIP, net\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, Other income/(expense) of CIP, net was a net gain of $57.0 million (three months ended September 30, 2024: net income of $16.7 million). Interest and dividend income of CIP decreased $10.3 million to $134.6 million (three months ended September 30, 2024: $144.9 million). Interest expense of CIP decreased $23.5 million to $94.5 million (three months ended September 30, 2024: $118.0 million). Unrealized gains/(losses) of CIP were a net gain of $16.9 million (three months ended September 30, 2024: net losses of $10.2 million).\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Other income/(expense) of CIP, net was net income of $116.8 million (nine months ended September 30, 2024: net income of $88.1 million). Interest and dividend income of CIP decreased $7.0 million to $388.2 million (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $395.2 million). Interest expense of CIP increased $14.2 million to $299.1 million (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $284.9 million). Unrealized gains/(losses) of CIP were a net gain of $27.7 million (nine months ended September 30, 2024: net losses of $22.2 million).\nNet impact of CIP and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities\nThe adjustment to Net income for the Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities removes the income/(expense) of CIP which is attributable to third-party investors. Therefore, the consolidation of investment products did not have an impact on Net income attributable to Invesco for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Also, the net income or loss of CIP is taxed at the investor level, not at the product level; therefore, a tax provision is not reflected in the net impact of CIP.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe company’s subsidiaries operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory tax rate. As a result, the blended statutory tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses from each jurisdiction.\nOur effective tax rate decreased to (2.8)% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 (three months ended September 30, 2024: 28.6%). The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, including the impact of a decrease in the deferred income tax rate and the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions.\nOur effective tax rate decreased to 15.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 (nine months ended September 30, 2024: 25.3%). The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, including the impact of a decrease in the deferred income tax rate and the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions. \nSchedule of Non-GAAP Information\nWe utilize the following non-GAAP performance measures: Net revenues (and by calculation, Net revenue yield on AUM), Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco and Adjusted diluted EPS. The company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company’s ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors. These measures also assist the company’s management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are Operating revenues (and by calculation, Gross revenue yield on AUM), Operating income, Operating margin, Net income attributable to Invesco and diluted EPS. Each of these measures is discussed more fully below.\nThe following are reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to the non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. The tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. Notes to the reconciliations follow the tables.\n39\n \nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Operating revenues to Net revenues:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOperating revenues, U.S. GAAP basis\n$\n1,640.4 \n$\n1,515.4 \n$\n4,685.1 \n$\n4,474.0 \nRevenue adjustments \n(1)\nInvestment management fees\n(236.8)\n(207.0)\n(657.6)\n(603.1)\nService and distribution fees\n(286.0)\n(252.0)\n(798.3)\n(777.3)\nOther\n(35.5)\n(40.6)\n(112.1)\n(118.6)\nTotal revenue adjustments\n(558.3)\n(499.6)\n(1,568.0)\n(1,499.0)\nInvesco Great Wall \n(2)\n94.3 \n76.9 \n251.7 \n237.7 \nCIP \n(3)\n9.9 \n11.6 \n30.8 \n30.6 \nNet revenues\n$\n1,186.3 \n$\n1,104.3 \n$\n3,399.6 \n$\n3,243.3 \nReconciliation of Operating income to Adjusted operating income:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOperating income, U.S. GAAP basis\n$\n270.9 \n$\n100.5 \n$\n762.4 \n$\n520.4 \nInvesco Great Wall \n(2)\n68.0 \n37.6 \n158.2 \n120.2 \nCIP \n(3)\n28.6 \n15.3 \n66.0 \n43.2 \nAmortization of intangible assets \n(4)\n9.0 \n11.2 \n28.8 \n33.9 \nCompensation expense related to market valuation changes of deferred compensation liabilities \n(5)\n29.6 \n36.6 \n59.7 \n65.3 \nOne-time acceleration of compensation expense for outstanding Long-term awards \n(6) \n— \n147.6 \n— \n147.6 \nSeverance \n(7) \n— \n— \n16.9 \n— \nSoftware impairment \n(8)\n— \n— \n8.0 \n— \nGeneral and administrative \n(9)\n— \n— \n— \n50.0 \nAdjusted operating income\n$\n406.1 \n$\n348.8 \n$\n1,100.0 \n$\n980.6 \nOperating margin \n(10)\n16.5 \n%\n6.6 \n%\n16.3 \n%\n11.6 \n%\nAdjusted operating margin \n(11)\n34.2 \n%\n31.6 \n%\n32.4 \n%\n30.2 \n%\n40\n \nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Net income attributable to Invesco to Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(in millions, except per common share data)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income attributable to Invesco Ltd., U.S. GAAP basis\n$\n301.3 \n$\n55.0 \n$\n459.9 \n$\n328.7 \nAdjustments (excluding tax):\nAmortization of intangible assets \n(4)\n$\n9.0 \n$\n11.2 \n$\n28.8 \n$\n33.9 \nDeferred compensation net market valuation changes \n(5)\n0.1 \n10.2 \n1.2 \n4.0 \nOne-time acceleration of compensation expense for outstanding Long-term awards \n(6)\n— \n147.6 \n— \n147.6 \nSeverance \n(7)\n— \n— \n16.9 \n— \nSoftware impairment \n(8)\n— \n— \n8.0 \n— \nGeneral and administrative \n(9)\n— \n— \n— \n50.0 \nTotal adjustments excluding tax\n$\n9.1 \n$\n169.0 \n$\n54.9 \n$\n235.5 \nImpact of deferred income tax rate change \n(12)\n$\n(39.0)\n$\n— \n$\n(39.0)\n$\n— \nTax adjustment for amortization of intangible assets and goodwill \n(13)\n4.0 \n4.5 \n12.1 \n13.3 \nOther tax effects of adjustments above\n— \n(28.7)\n(6.1)\n(33.1)\nRepurchase of preferred stock \n(14)\n— \n— \n159.3 \n— \nAdjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. \n$\n275.4 \n$\n199.8 \n$\n641.1 \n$\n544.4 \nAverage common shares outstanding - diluted\n454.6 \n455.6 \n454.9 \n457.9 \nDiluted EPS\n$\n0.66 \n$\n0.12 \n$\n1.01 \n$\n0.72 \nAdjusted diluted EPS \n(15)\n$\n0.61 \n$\n0.44 \n$\n1.41 \n$\n1.19 \n____________\n(1)    Revenue adjustments: The company calculates Net revenues by reducing Operating revenues to exclude fees that are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company’s managed funds. The Net revenue presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the company, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco’s own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates Net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to Net revenues divided by Average AUM during the reporting period, as an indicator of the Net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage.\nInvestment management fees are adjusted by renewal commissions and certain administrative fees. Service and distribution fees are primarily adjusted by distribution fees passed through to broker dealers for certain share classes and pass through fund-related costs. Other revenues are primarily adjusted by transaction fees passed through to third parties.\n(2)    Invesco Great Wall: The company reflects 100% of IGW in its Net revenues and Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin). The company’s non-GAAP operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying AUM and flows. Adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. \n(3)    CIP: See note 11, “Consolidated Investment Products,” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of CIP. The company believes that CIP may impact a reader’s analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust Operating revenues and Operating income for the impact of CIP in calculating the respective Net revenues and Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin).\n(4)    Amortization of intangible assets: The company removes amortization expense related to acquired assets in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition-related charges.\n(5)    Market valuation changes related to deferred compensation plan liabilities: Certain deferred compensation plan awards provide a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments. The company economically hedges the exposure to market movements on these deferred compensation liabilities. Since these liabilities are economically hedged, the company believes it is useful to remove the market movements related to the deferred compensation plan liabilities from the calculation of Adjusted operating income (and by calculation, Adjusted operating margin) and to remove the net impact of the economic hedge from the calculation of Adjusted net income (and by calculation, Adjusted diluted EPS) to produce results that will be more comparable period to period.\n41\n \nTable of Contents\n(6)    One-time acceleration of compensation expense for outstanding Long-term awards: In the third quarter of 2024, the company recorded a one-time acceleration of Compensation expense of $147.6 million resulting from changes to the retirement criteria for vesting of outstanding Long-term awards. Due to the non-recurring nature of this item, the company removed this expense in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS as this will aid comparability of our results period to period. \n(7)    Severance: In the second quarter of 2025, the company removed the severance expense related to the reorganization of its fundamental equities investment teams. The company removed this expense in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar reorganization related charges. \n(8)    Software impairment: In the second quarter of 2025, the company removed the non-cash software impairment related to a strategic change in our fixed income investment platform. The company removed the expense in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS as this will aid comparability of our results period to period.\n(9)    General and administrative: In 2024, the company removed the expense related to the settlement of regulatory matters. Due to the non-recurring nature of this item, the company removed this expense in arriving at Adjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin and Adjusted diluted EPS as this will aid comparability of our results period to period.\n(10)    Operating margin is equal to Operating income divided by Operating revenues.\n(11)    Adjusted operating margin is equal to Adjusted operating income divided by Net revenues.\n(12)    Impact of deferred income tax rate change: In the third quarter of 2025, the company removed a non-cash income tax benefit of $39.0 million related to the revaluation of the deferred tax liabilities for indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of a decrease in the tax rate. The company removed this discrete tax benefit in arriving at Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted EPS as it does not have a cash flow impact and will aid comparability of our results period to period. \n(13)    Tax adjustment for amortization of intangible assets and goodwill: The company reflects the tax benefit realized on the tax amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in Adjusted net income. The company believes it is useful to include this tax benefit in arriving at the Adjusted diluted EPS measure.\n(14)    Repurchase of preferred stock: In the second quarter of 2025, the company repurchased $1.0 billion of the company’s outstanding Series A Preferred Stock held by MassMutual. The company removed the costs associated with the repurchase from the calculation of Adjusted net income (and by calculation, Adjusted diluted EPS) as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar repurchase related charges.\n(15)    Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted common shares outstanding.\n42\n \nTable of Contents\nBalance Sheet Discussion \n(1)\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of the balance sheet information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis to the balance sheet information excluding the impact of CIP for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the table: \nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nBalance sheet information\n(in millions)\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nAs Adjusted\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nAs Adjusted\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n973.1 \n$\n— \n$\n973.1 \n$\n986.5 \n$\n— \n$\n986.5 \nInvestments\n1,164.2 \n444.9 \n1,609.1 \n1,240.0 \n401.4 \n1,641.4 \nGoodwill and intangible assets, net\n14,191.0 \n— \n14,191.0 \n14,067.4 \n— \n14,067.4 \nOther assets \n(2)\n2,554.4 \n10.6 \n2,565.0 \n2,340.5 \n11.1 \n2,351.6 \nInvestments and other assets of CIP  \n(3)\n9,556.2 \n(9,556.2)\n— \n8,374.5 \n(8,374.5)\n— \nTotal assets\n$\n28,438.9 \n$\n(9,100.7)\n$\n19,338.2 \n$\n27,008.9 \n$\n(7,962.0)\n$\n19,046.9 \nLIABILITIES\nDebt\n$\n1,624.6 \n$\n— \n$\n1,624.6 \n$\n890.6 \n$\n— \n$\n890.6 \nOther liabilities \n(4)\n3,708.0 \n— \n3,708.0 \n3,596.4 \n— \n3,596.4 \nDebt and other liabilities of CIP \n8,314.0 \n(8,314.0)\n— \n6,853.1 \n(6,853.1)\n— \nTotal liabilities\n$\n13,646.6 \n$\n(8,314.0)\n$\n5,332.6 \n$\n11,340.1 \n$\n(6,853.1)\n$\n4,487.0 \nEQUITY\nTotal equity attributable to Invesco Ltd.\n$\n14,005.6 \n$\n— \n$\n14,005.6 \n$\n14,559.9 \n$\n— \n$\n14,559.9 \nNoncontrolling interests \n(5)\n786.7 \n(786.7)\n— \n1,108.9 \n(1,108.9)\n— \nTotal equity\n14,792.3 \n(786.7)\n14,005.6 \n15,668.8 \n(1,108.9)\n14,559.9 \nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n28,438.9 \n$\n(9,100.7)\n$\n19,338.2 \n$\n27,008.9 \n$\n(7,962.0)\n$\n19,046.9 \n____________\n(1)    This table includes non-GAAP presentations. Assets of CIP are not available for use by Invesco. Additionally, there is no recourse to Invesco for CIP debt.\n(2)    Amounts include Accounts receivable, Property, equipment and software, and Other assets.\n(3)    Amounts also include Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable of CIP.\n(4)    Amounts include Accrued compensation and benefits, Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and Deferred tax liabilities.\n(5)    Amounts include Redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and Equity attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $13.4 million from $986.5 million at December 31, 2024 to $973.1 million at September 30, 2025. See “Cash Flows Discussion” below within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the period.\nInvestments\nInvestments are comprised primarily of the equity method investment in IGW, seed capital and co-investments in affiliated funds, and investments related to the company’s deferred compensation plans. \nAs of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the company had $1,135.6 million and $1,125.6 million in seed capital and co-investments, respectively, including direct investments in CIP.

The increase includes foreign exchange impacts of $227.3 million, partially offset by the transfers of $74.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets to held for sale and amortization of $28.8 million. Unfavorable changes in market conditions could result in an impairment of our goodwill and/or intangible assets. A goodwill impairment may be triggered by a significant decline in our revenue and operating income or a sustained decrease in our stock price. The majority of indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to acquired management contracts of U.S. retail mutual funds. An impairment of this intangible asset may occur if there continues to be outflows and a decline in the revenue generated from these contracts. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nOur capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our Revolving credit agreement and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating expenses, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements.\nSources of Liquidity by Type\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n973.1 \n$\n986.5 \nAvailable Revolving credit agreement\n2,500.0 \n2,000.0 \nTotal sources of liquidity by type\n$\n3,473.1 \n$\n2,986.5 \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, the company repaid $260.0 million of the outstanding balance on the three-year bank term loan due on May 16, 2028. As of September 30, 2025, the balance on the Revolving credit agreement was zero.\nCapital Management\nOur capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include, in no particular order of priority: reinvestment in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of share repurchases and modestly increasing dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the company repurchased 4.4 million common shares for $75 million in the open market. \nOur capital management process is executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain strong, investment grade credit ratings. As of the date of our filing, Invesco held credit ratings of BBB+/Stable, A3/Stable and A/Stable from Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Ratings Service, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch Ratings, respectively. \nOther Items\nCertain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital, liquidity, and working capital. Such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance, and review from regulators. These and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of \n44\n \nTable of Contents\nintercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. Our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us.\nWe are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. As of September 30, 2025, the company’s minimum regulatory capital requirement was $322.3 million (December 31, 2024: $324.9 million).\nWe meet the regulatory liquidity and working capital requirements by holding cash and cash equivalents in the European sub-group. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group in the countries where it is located. Due to the liquidity and working capital requirements, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences.\nThe consolidation of $9,556.2 million of assets and $6,734.7 million of debt of CIP as of September 30, 2025, respectively, did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 11, “Consolidated Investment Products,” for additional details.\n45\n \nTable of Contents\nCash Flows Discussion\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of the cash flow information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis to the cash flows information excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIP for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the table:\nCash flows information \n(1)\nNine months ended September 30, 2025\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\n(in millions)\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nExcluding CIP\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nExcluding CIP\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of the period \n$\n1,496.0 \n$\n(509.5)\n$\n986.5 \n$\n1,931.6 \n$\n(462.4)\n$\n1,469.2 \nCash flows from operating activities\n1,069.5 \n(117.5)\n952.0 \n873.1 \n(109.0)\n764.1 \nCash flows from investing activities\n(622.2)\n565.1 \n(57.1)\n85.3 \n(180.9)\n(95.6)\nCash flows from financing activities\n(505.6)\n(452.4)\n(958.0)\n(1,269.1)\n159.5 \n(1,109.6)\nIncrease/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n(58.3)\n(4.8)\n(63.1)\n(310.7)\n(130.4)\n(441.1)\nForeign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents\n86.1 \n(36.4)\n49.7 \n18.5 \n(1.7)\n16.8 \nCash and cash equivalents, end of the period\n$\n1,523.8 \n$\n(550.7)\n$\n973.1 \n$\n1,639.4 \n$\n(594.5)\n$\n1,044.9 \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n973.1 \n$\n— \n$\n973.1 \n$\n1,044.9 \n$\n— \n$\n1,044.9 \nCash and cash equivalents of CIP\n550.7 \n(550.7)\n— \n594.5 \n(594.5)\n— \nTotal cash and cash equivalents per condensed consolidated statement of cash flows\n$\n1,523.8 \n$\n(550.7)\n$\n973.1 \n$\n1,639.4 \n$\n(594.5)\n$\n1,044.9 \n____________\n(1)   These tables include non-GAAP presentations. Cash held by CIP is not available for use by Invesco. Additionally, there is no recourse to Invesco for CIP debt. The cash flows of CIP do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions.\nOperating Activities\nOperating cash flows include the receipt of Investment management and other fees generated from AUM, offset by Operating expenses and Changes in operating assets and liabilities. After allowing for the change in cash held by CIP, investment activities, non-cash activity, and seasonal payments such as bonus payments in the first quarter, our operating cash flows generally move in the same direction as our Operating income.\nCash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, excluding the impact of the consolidation of CIP, was partially offset by net outflows from changes in payables and receivables due to timing of payments and receipts.   \nInvesting Activities\nInvesting cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, excluding the impact of the consolidation of CIP, included Purchase of investments of $137.0 million (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $149.5 million purchases) and capital expenditures of $60.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $76.1 million). Our capital expenditures related principally to investments in technology projects. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $140.5 million from Capital distributions from equity method investees (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $129.8 million). \n46\n \nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, excluding the impact of the consolidation of CIP, included net cash inflows of $992.7 million related to the new bank term loans and cash outflows of $1.0 billion to repurchase the company’s Series A Preferred Stock. Financing cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 also included the $150.0 million premium paid on the repurchase of Series A Preferred Stock, $282.7 million of common dividend payments for the dividends declared in January and April and July (nine months ended September 30, 2024: common dividends paid of $278.7 million), $160.2 million of preferred dividend payments for dividends declared in January and April and July (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $177.6 million), the payment of $22.8 million to meet employees’ withholding tax obligations on common share vestings (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $28.3 million) and purchases of common shares through the open market of $75.0 million (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $25.0 million). The nine months ended September 30, 2025 also included a $260.0 million repayment on the three-year bank term loan due on May 16, 2028 (nine months ended September 30, 2024: $600.0 million redemption of our senior notes). \nDividends\nWhen declared, Invesco pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. Holders of our preferred shares are eligible to receive dividends at an annual rate of 5.9%\n \nof the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, or $59 per share per annum. The preferred stock dividend is payable quarterly on a non-cumulative basis when, if and as declared by our Board. However, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for a particular dividend period, we may not declare or pay dividends on, redeem, purchase or acquire, our common stock or other junior securities in the next succeeding dividend period. In addition, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for six quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors of the company will be increased by two and the holders of the preferred shares shall have the right to elect such two additional members of the Board.\nOn October 27, 2025, the company declared a third quarter 2025 cash dividend of $0.21 per common share to the holders of common shares. The dividend is payable on December 2, 2025, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on November 14, 2025, with an ex-dividend date of November 14, 2025.\nOn October 27, 2025, the company declared a preferred dividend of $14.75 per preferred share, representing the period from September 1, 2025 through November 30, 2025. The preferred dividend is payable on December 1, 2025. \nThe declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The company has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels and historical dividend payouts.\nCommon Share Repurchase Plan\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, the company repurchased 1.2 million common shares for $25 million in the open market; during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the company repurchased 4.4 million common shares for $75 million in the open market (three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: 1.5 million common shares for $25 million;). At September 30, 2025, approximately $257.2 million remains available under the share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board on July 22, 2016.\nPreferred Stock Repurchase\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the company repurchased $1.0 billion of the $4.0 billion outstanding Series A Preferred Stock held by MassMutual for $1.15 billion.\nDebt\nThe carrying value of our debt at September 30, 2025 was $1,624.6 million (December 31, 2024: $890.6 million). See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 4, \"Debt,\" for additional disclosures.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the company’s weighted average cost of debt was 4.82% (nine months ended September 30, 2024: 4.70%).\n47\n \nTable of Contents\nFinancial covenants under the Revolving credit agreement and Term loan agreement (collectively, Credit agreements) include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of an Adjusted debt/Earnings before income tax, depreciation, amortization, interest expense, common share-based compensation expense, unrealized (gains)/losses from investments, net, and unusual or otherwise non-recurring gains and losses (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit agreements, of not greater than 3.25:1.00, (ii) an interest coverage ratio (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA/interest expense for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At September 30, 2025, our leverage ratio was 0.63:1.00 (December 31, 2024: 0.25:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 22.70:1.00 (December 31, 2024: 26.84:1.00).\nThe September 30, 2025 coverage ratio calculations are as follows:\n(in millions)\nTotal\nQ3 2025\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Invesco Ltd.\n$\n669.2 \n$\n301.3 \n$\n(12.5)\n$\n171.1 \n$\n209.3 \nDividends on preferred shares\n219.4 \n44.4 \n56.6 \n59.2 \n59.2 \nInterest expense\n71.9 \n25.7 \n20.7 \n13.1 \n12.4 \nTax expense/(benefit)\n223.6 \n(9.7)\n77.0 \n77.6 \n78.7 \nAmortization/depreciation \n(1)\n193.4 \n43.9 \n53.8 \n47.1 \n48.6 \nCommon share-based compensation expense\n71.9 \n20.9 \n21.7 \n15.2 \n14.1 \nSeverance\n (2)\n16.9 \n— \n16.9 \n— \n— \nRegulatory matters \n(2)\n2.5 \n— \n— \n— \n2.5 \nCost of preferred stock repurchase \n(2)\n159.3 \n— \n159.3 \n— \n— \nUnrealized (gains)/losses from investments, net \n(3)\n4.4 \n(1.1)\n(33.5)\n23.1 \n15.9 \nCovenant Adjusted EBITDA \n(4)\n$\n1,632.5 \n$\n425.4 \n$\n360.0 \n$\n406.4 \n$\n440.7 \nAdjusted debt \n(4)\n$\n1,028.2 \nLeverage ratio as of September 30, 2025 (Adjusted debt/Covenant Adjusted EBITDA - maximum 3.25:1.00)\n0.63 \nInterest coverage ratio as of September 30, 2025 (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA/Interest expense - minimum 4.00:1.00)\n22.70 \n(1)    Includes amortization and impairment of cloud technology implementation costs.\n(2)    Unusual or otherwise non-recurring gains and losses, as defined in our Credit agreements, are adjusted for in the determination of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. Severance expense related to the reorganization of the company’s fundamental equities investment teams and costs associated with the repurchase of the company’s outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in the second quarter of 2025 were non-recurring expenses and have been removed from Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. Adjustments to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA in 2024 included the settlement of regulatory matters. \n(3)    Adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our Credit agreements, may also include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures.\n(4)    Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted debt are non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management in connection with certain debt covenant calculations under our Credit agreements. The calculation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA above (a reconciliation from Net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.) is defined by our Credit agreements, and therefore Net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. The calculation of Adjusted debt is defined in our amended Credit agreements and equals debt of $1,624.6 million plus $3.6 million in letters of credit less $600.0 million of excess unrestricted cash (cash and cash equivalents less the minimum regulatory capital requirement, not to exceed $600 million).\nCredit and Liquidity Risk\nThe company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk). \n48\n \nTable of Contents\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. As of \nSeptember 30, 2025, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent bal\nances is $973.1 million, of which $504.2 million is invested in affiliated money market funds. \nSee Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 2, \"Fair Value of Assets \nand Liabilities,\" for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they become due. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,624.6 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed Revolving credit agreement, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our net income could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. A decline in the values of AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the value of AUM.\nOff Balance Sheet Commitments\nSee Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Contingencies,\" for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThere have been no changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Critical accounting policies are those that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and would therefore be deemed the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 1, \"Accounting Policies - Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted.”\n49\n \nTable of Contents"
