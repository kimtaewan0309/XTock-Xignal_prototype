Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Solventum for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. For full understanding of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, the below discussion should be read alongside the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and particularly in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nAll amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Amounts reported within this interim report are rounded to the nearest million and the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references to “Solventum” and the “Company” refer to (i) 3M’s Health Care Business prior to the Spin-Off as a carve-out business of 3M and (ii) Solventum Corporation and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off.\nTransition to Standalone Company\nSolventum utilized allocations and carve-out methodologies through the date of the Spin-Off to prepare combined financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements herein for periods prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of the Company’s future performance, do not necessarily include the actual expenses that would have been incurred, and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, standalone company during the historical periods presented.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Solventum’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. Solventum’s MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n•\nOverview\n•\nResults of Operations\n•\nPerformance by Business Segment\n•\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nOverview\nSolventum is a leading global healthcare company developing, manufacturing, and commercializing a broad portfolio of solutions that leverages deep material science, data science, and digital capabilities to address critical customer and patient needs. We constantly seek to enable the improvement of standards of care and move healthcare forward with innovation powered by insights, clinical intelligence, technology, and manufacturing expertise. Our 70+ year history of discovering and innovating advanced solutions has helped us solve our customers’ toughest challenges and become a trusted partner.\n26\nTable of Contents\n \nOperating Segments and Sales Change Information\nSolventum manages its operations in three business segments: MedSurg, Dental Solutions, and Health Information Systems. On February 25, 2025, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement to sell its Purification and Filtration business to Buyer. On June 25, 2025, the Company and Buyer entered into an additional Agreement to exclude the Company’s Water Business from the scope of the Business to be acquired by Buyer. On September 1, 2025, Solventum completed the sale of the Business to the Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The cash consideration paid to Solventum at closing was approximately $4 billion. Refer to Note 3, “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information. \nReferences are made to organic sales change, which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Constant currency, as reflected in the tables below, is defined as the change in net sales absent the impact on sales from foreign currency translation. Other, as comprised in the tables below, includes acquisition and divestiture-related activities. Acquisitions include non-health care related supply agreements that conveyed from 3M to the Company at Spin-Off and sales from new supply agreements with 3M that commenced at Spin-Off. Divestiture impacts include lost sales from both the Company’s Purification and Filtration business that was sold in September 2025 and the dental anesthetics business that was sold in August 2023, as well as lost sales from certain health care businesses retained by 3M India in connection with the Spin-Off. Solventum believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\nSales and operating income by business segment:\nThe following tables contain sales and operating results by business segment for all periods presented. The Company’s use of the term “NM” reflects results considered not material due to either not having material activity in comparable prior years or is not meaningful. Refer to the section entitled \n“\n—Performance by Business Segment\n”\n below for discussion of sales change and operating performance.

Organic growth was led by Dental Solutions.\nFirst nine months 2025 results:\n•\nIn the United States geographic area, both total sales and organic sales increased. Organic growth occurred across all segments, led by MedSurg and Health Information Systems. \n•\nIn the International geographic area, both total sales and organic sales increased. Organic growth was led by MedSurg, partially offset by a decline in Purification and Filtration.\nManaging currency risks\nPrior to April 1, 2024, Solventum indirectly participated in 3M’s centrally managed hedging program. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, Solventum established its own hedging program. Refer to Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nForeign currency had a positive worldwide impact on sales for the third quarter 2025 compared to the same period last year. The worldwide impact on sales for the nine months ended 2025 was positive compared to the same period last year. Solventum estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by \n29\nTable of Contents\n \napproximately $4 million and increased pre-tax income by approximately $6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. \nFinancial condition\nRefer to the section entitled \n“\n—Financial Condition and Liquidity\n”\n below for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nRefer to the preceding \n“\n—Overview\n”\n section and the \n“\n—Performance by Business Segment\n”\n section later in MD&A for discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(Percent of corresponding net sales)\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nCost of product\n53.1 \n%\n49.3 \n%\n3.8 \n%\n52.4 \n%\n49.1 \n%\n3.3 \n%\nCost of software and rentals\n22.7 \n26.2 \n(3.5)\n24.3 \n25.8 \n(1.5)\nCost of Product\nCost of product includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.\nCost of product, measured as a percent of sales of product, increased in the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the third quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by increased costs due to the impact of higher sourcing costs from tariffs and inventory sourced under the master supply and transition manufacturing agreements with 3M, partially offset by benefits from cost savings programs.\nCost of product, measured as a percent of sales of product, increased in the first nine months of 2025 when compared to the first nine months of  2024. The increase was driven by increased costs due to the impact of higher sourcing costs from tariffs and inventory sourced under the master supply and transition manufacturing agreements with 3M partially offset by benefits from cost savings programs.\nCost of Software and Rentals\nCost of software and rentals includes compensation-related costs associated with installation, training and maintenance for our software products, and depreciation, maintenance and refurbishment cost and freight costs related to our hardware rental units.\nCost of software and rentals, measured as a percent of sales of software and rentals, decreased during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the same period last year due to the impact, primarily driven by benefits from lower external license fees and product mix benefit from higher sales of our revenue cycle management solutions.  \nCost of software and rentals, measured as a percent of sales of software and rentals, decreased during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the same period last year due to the impact of lower external license fees, price and sales mix, primarily driven by higher sales of our revenue cycle management solution.  \nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(Percent of total net sales)\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A)\n37.2 \n%\n33.7 \n%\n3.5 \n%\n36.7 \n%\n32.3 \n%\n4.4 \n%\nResearch and development (R&D)\n8.7 \n9.1 \n(0.4)\n8.9 \n9.3 \n(0.4)\nGain on sale of business\n(72.4)\n— \n(72.4)\n(24.0)\n— \n(24.0)\nOperating income\n80.6 \n13.2 \n67.4 \n32.5 \n14.6 \n17.9 \n30\nTable of Contents\n \nSelling, General and Administrative\nSG&A, measured as a percent of total net sales, increased in the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher costs associated with activities to separate operations from 3M, costs incurred to separate the Purification and Filtration business, and higher compensation expense, including equity-based awards, partially offset by benefits from the Solventum Way restructuring program.\nSG&A, measured as a percent of total net sales, increased in the first nine months of 2025 when compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by costs incurred to separate the Purification and Filtration business, higher compensation, including equity-based awards, and higher costs associated with both initial stand-up and ongoing operations to support a standalone company.\nResearch and Development\nR&D, measured as a percent of total net sales, decreased in the third quarter of 2025 when compared to the same period last year due to lower cost from the sale of the Purification and Filtration business in relation to higher net sales. \nR&D, measured as a percent of total net sales, decreased in the first nine months of 2025 when compared to the same period last year due to lower cost from the sale of the Purification and Filtration business in relation to higher net sales. \nGain on Sale of Business\nThe Company completed the sale of the Purification and Filtration business in the third quarter of 2025. This resulted in a net gain of $1.5 billion for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025. \nInterest Expense, Net, Loss on Debt Extinguishment, Net, and Other Expense (Income), Net\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(Millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nInterest expense, net\n$\n89 \n$\n107 \n$\n296 \n$\n260 \nLoss on debt extinguishment, net\n82 \n— \n82 \n— \nOther expense (income), net \n5 \n1 \n$\n24 \n$\n48 \nInterest expense, net includes interest accrued on debt obligations, offset by interest income from cash and marketable securities. Interest expense, net decreased in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year due to lower interest expense as a result of lower debt outstanding. Interest expense, net increased in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the same period last year due to a full quarter of interest incurred in the first quarter of 2025 related to the February 2024 issuance of senior notes and March 2024 draw on the senior term loan credit facilities. Refer to Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.\nLoss on debt extinguishment, net includes charges incurred in the third quarter of 2025 from the differential between carrying value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered Senior Notes and related expenses. Refer to Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. These charges were partially offset by the gain from interest rate swaps entered into and subsequently settled in connection with the sale of the Purification and Filtration business. Refer to Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOther expense (income), net includes the non-service component of periodic pension cost, investment gains and losses, and foreign currency transaction gain (loss). Other expense (income), net increased for the third quarter of 2025 primarily due to higher non-service periodic pension costs. Other expense (income), net decreased for the nine months of 2025 as compared to the same period last year primarily due to charges associated with the substantial liquidation of foreign operations completed as part of our separation from 3M.  \nProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(Percent of pre-tax income/loss)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nEffective tax rate \n16.4 \n%\n26.9 \n%\n9.8 \n%\n24.3 \n%\nRefer to Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.\n31\nTable of Contents\n \nPerformance by Business Segment\nNote 17 to the condensed consolidated financial statements provides an overview of Solventum’s business segments in addition to disclosures relating to Solventum’s segments. Upon closing the sale of our Purification and Filtration business, we primarily manage our operations in three business segments. Our reportable segments are MedSurg, Dental Solutions, and Health Information Systems. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates segment operating performance using net sales and business segment operating income. \nAll Other\nAll Other primarily consists of the Water Business that was retained after the sale of the Purification and Filtration Business. All Other also includes sales and cost of sales related to our agreements to supply 3M and other supply agreements assumed by the Company at Spin-Off related to legacy 3M businesses, which were historically included within Corporate and Unallocated.\nCorporate and Unallocated\nCertain items are maintained at the corporate level and not allocated to the segments (\n“\nCorporate and Unallocated\n”\n). Corporate and Unallocated includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring and related charges, and benefits or costs related to capitalized manufacturing variances. In addition, Corporate and Unallocated includes Spin-Off and separation related costs. Spin-Off and separation related costs include any costs incurred as part of our separation from 3M and costs to setup operations as a standalone company, including system implementations, manufacturing relocations, legal entity separations, certain equity awards granted as part of the Spin-Off, profit mark-ups on transition service arrangements with 3M and other one-time costs.\nBecause Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\nBusiness Segment Information\nInformation related to the Company’s segments is presented in the tables that follow with additional context in the corresponding narrative below the tables. \nMedSurg (\n57.5%\n and 56.6% of consolidated sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025)\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(Millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet sales \n$\n1,206 \n$\n1,182\n$\n3,581 \n$\n3,463\nIncrease/(decrease)\nOrganic growth\n1.1 \n %\n1.0 \n %\n3.6 \n %\n1.1 \n %\nOther\n—\n(0.7)\n(0.3)\n(0.5)\nConstant currency\n1.1\n0.2\n3.3\n0.6\nCurrency impact\n1.0\n(0.1)\n0.1\n(0.6)\nReported growth\n2.1 \n %\n0.1 \n %\n3.4 \n %\n— \n %\nBusiness segment operating income\n$\n203 \n$\n243\n$\n619 \n$\n678\nPercent change\n(16.5)\n%\n(20.8)\n %\n(8.7)\n%\n(18.2)\n %\nPercent of sales\n16.8 \n%\n20.6 \n %\n17.3 \n%\n19.6 \n %\nThird quarter 2025 results:\nSales in MedSurg were up 2.1%: \n•\nOrganic growth was driven by volumes in Advanced Wound Care, due to negative pressure wound therapy.

Historically, Solventum generated positive operating cash flows and a majority of such cash flows were transferred to 3M as part of 3M’s cash pooling arrangements, the effect of which is presented as Net transfers to 3M in our consolidated financial statements. \nDebt and Credit Facilities\nRefer to Note 9 of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on the Company's long-term debt and short-term borrowings.\nThe Company had approximately $84 million and $40 million in bank guarantees, surety bonds, and other similar instruments issued and outstanding at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\nCommercial Paper\nOn March 4, 2024, the Company entered into a commercial paper program that allows it to issue up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of short-term notes to finance short-term liabilities. Any such issuance will mature within 364 days from date of issue. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2025.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \nAs of September 30, 2025, Solventum had $1,642 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1,438 million was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $204 million was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. As of December 31, 2024, Solventum had $762 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $611 million was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and $151 million was held in the United States. There were immaterial amounts of marketable securities at both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The increase from December 31, 2024 was driven by proceeds from the sale of the Purification and Filtration business, partially offset by repurchases of a portion of our senior notes via tender offers and a prepayment on our outstanding term loan.\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows exclude the effect of exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.\n35\nTable of Contents\n \nNine months ended September 30,\n(Millions)\n2025\n2024\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n274 \n$\n966 \nInvesting activities\n3,542 \n(253)\nFinancing activities\n(2,942)\n(136)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n6 \n1 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n880 \n$\n578 \nOperating Activities\nIn the first nine months of 2025, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased compared to the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to lower net income, excluding the gain on sale of the Purification and Filtration business, transaction costs on sale of the business, higher inventories, and accrued compensation activity.  \nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in investing activities is related to proceeds from sale of the Purification and Filtration business in September 2025.\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment increased in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024. The increase is primarily driven by additional separation related capital spending as the Company relocates manufacturing and source of supply from 3M. In addition, the Company is focused on investments to support growth, renewal and maintenance programs, and environmental health services.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the first nine months of 2025, cash flows used by financing activities increased as compared to the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to the Company's repayment of $1.9 billion of senior notes via tender offers upon completion of the sale of the Purification and Filtration business and $770 million repayment of outstanding principal issued under the senior term loan credit facility.   \nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations:\nSolventum’s material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to the following, for which information on both a short-term and long-term basis is provided in the indicated notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements:\n•\nTax obligations—Refer to Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n•\nDebt—Refer to Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n•\nCommitments and contingencies—Refer to Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. \nSolventum purchases the majority of its materials and services as needed, with no unconditional commitments. In limited circumstances, in the normal course of business, the Company enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors that may take the form of, for example, take or pay contracts in which the Company guarantees payment to ensure availability of certain materials or services or to ensure ongoing efforts on capital projects. The Company expects to receive underlying materials or services for these purchase obligations. To the extent these purchase obligations fluctuate, it largely trends with normal-course changes in regular operating activities. Additionally, contractual capital commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending.\n36\nTable of Contents\n \nCautionary Note Concerning Forward Looking Statements \nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including \n“\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n”\n in Part I, Item 2, and other materials Solventum has filed or will file with the SEC (and oral communications that Solventum may make) contain or incorporate by reference statements that relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties.
