Risk Factors.\n \n\n\nThe Companies’ forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. The Companies caution the reader not to place undue reliance on their forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. The Companies undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\n \n\n\nACCOUNTING MATTERS\n \n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \n\n\nDominion Energy has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion Energy has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\n \n\n\nAccounting for Regulated Operations\n \n\n\nThe accounting for Dominion Energy’s regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that Dominion Energy is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds or other benefits through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. In addition, a loss is recognized if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made.\n \n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Companies recorded a net $103 million ($77 million after-tax) charge for Virginia Power’s share of costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project as a result of a revised total project cost estimate of approximately $10.7 billion, excluding financing costs, that reflects a revised estimate of network upgrade costs assigned by PJM to the CVOW Commercial Project and cost sharing mechanism included in the Virginia Commission’s December 2022 order. The expected total project cost reflects increases driven primarily by projections for onshore electrical interconnection costs and network upgrade costs assigned to the project by PJM, specifically incorporating consideration of PJM’s December 2024 publication of potential transmission network upgrades required for certain generation projects and related cost allocations, including those\n \n\n\n \n55\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nattributable to the CVOW Commercial Project. Relative to Virginia Power’s November 2024 Rider OSW filing, the updated estimated total project cost reflects an approximately $0.6 billion increase for such onshore and network upgrade costs and an approximately $0.3 billion increase for increased contingency for remaining construction activities, completion of the removal of unexploded ordnance, undersea cable protection system design enhancements, commodity prices for transportation fuel, updates for sea fastener fabrication and installation and other construction and equipment supplier costs.\n \n\n\nThe estimated total project cost reflects the Companies’ best estimate of the remaining construction costs, including contingency of approximately 5% on such remaining amounts. Such estimate could potentially change for items, certain of which are beyond the Companies’ control, including but not limited to actual network upgrade costs allocated by PJM, fuel for transportation and installation, the impact of applicable tariffs, if any, costs to maintain necessary permits, approvals and authorizations, ability of key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under existing contracts, marine wildlife and/or any severe weather events.  Any additional increase in such costs in excess of the contingency included in the estimated total project cost would be subject to the cost sharing mechanisms described above and could have a material impact on the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable as well as whether a regulatory liability due to customers is probable and makes various assumptions in its analyses. These analyses are generally based on:\n\n\n•\nOrders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation and judicial actions;\n\n\n•\nPast experience;\n\n\n•\nDiscussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel;\n\n\n•\nEstimated construction costs;\n\n\n•\nForecasted earnings; and \n\n\n•\nConsiderations around the likelihood of impacts from events such as unusual weather conditions, extreme weather events and other natural disasters and unplanned outages of facilities. \n\n\nIf recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. A regulatory liability, if considered probable, will be recorded in the period such assessment is made or reversed into earnings if no longer probable. In connection with the future 2025 Biennial Review, the Companies concluded that it was not probable that Virginia Power would have earnings in excess of an expected authorized ROE of 9.70% for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024. As a result, no regulatory liability for Virginia Power ratepayer credits to customers has been recorded at December 31, 2024. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\n\nDominion Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine fair value and are generally capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, Dominion Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation or credit-adjusted risk free rates in the future, may be significant. When Dominion Energy revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased or are expected to cease operations, Dominion Energy adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes either recognized in income or as a regulatory asset.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy’s AROs include a significant balance related to the future decommissioning of its nonregulated and utility nuclear facilities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Dominion Energy’s nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The following discusses critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs associated with Dominion Energy’s nuclear decommissioning obligations.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy obtains from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. These cash flows include estimates on timing of decommissioning, which for regulated nuclear units factors in the probability of NRC approval for license extensions. In addition, Dominion Energy’s cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. Dominion Energy determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions. At December 31, 2024, a 0.25% increase in cost escalation rates would have resulted in an approximate $440 million increase in Dominion Energy’s nuclear decommissioning AROs.\n\n\n \n56\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy’s AROs also include $828 million for future CCR remediation at retired generating stations and other inactive or previously closed surface impoundments, landfills or other areas in connection with the EPA’s May 2024 rule as described in Note 14. Dominion Energy developed cost estimates related to this CCR remediation, which were based on the estimated quantity of CCRs that would be discovered, if any, at locations which are subject to the regulation. The determination of how much CCR, if any, that exists at an individual location is a critical assumption in the development of the Companies’ AROs. The results of the searches of internally and externally available information regarding the existence and quantity of CCR at specific locations, as well as physical searches for CCR, may cause actual results to vary significantly from expectations.\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws and associated regulations involves uncertainty since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.\n\n\nGiven the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Dominion Energy had $78 million and $110 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.\n\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion Energy evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. In addition, changes in tax laws or tax rates may require reconsideration of the realizability of existing deferred tax assets. Dominion Energy establishes a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Dominion Energy had established $113 million and $130 million, respectively, of valuation allowances.\n\n\nAccounting for Derivative Contracts and Financial Instruments at Fair Value\n \n\n\nDominion Energy uses derivative contracts such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity, interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate risks of its business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The majority of investments held in Dominion Energy’s nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trusts and pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 6 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.\n \n\n\nFair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion Energy considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion Energy believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion Energy must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for quantitative information on unobservable inputs utilized in Dominion Energy’s fair value measurements of certain derivative contracts.\n\n\nUse of Estimates in Goodwill Impairment Testing\n \n\n\nIn April of each year, Dominion Energy tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2024, 2023 and 2022 annual test did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\n \n\n\n \n57\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn general, Dominion Energy estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion Energy’s estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion Energy’s estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion Energy has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent test had been 10% lower or if the discount rate had been 0.25% higher, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\n\n\nIn addition to the annual goodwill impairment testing described above, Dominion Energy’s calculations during the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024 of the expected gain or loss on the Questar Gas and East Ohio Transactions resulted in an impairment of the related goodwill totaling $238 million and $78 million, respectively, reflected in discontinued operations in Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n\nSee Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n \n\n\nUse of Estimates in Long-Lived Asset Impairment Testing\n \n\n\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite lives, is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When a long-lived asset’s carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets in the case of long-lived assets and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of a market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about the operations of the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether a long-lived asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset or underlying assets of equity method investees, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. In 2022, Dominion Energy determined that its nonregulated solar generation assets within Contracted Energy were impaired. The estimates of future cash flows and selection of a discount rate are considered to be critical assumptions. A 10% decrease in projected future pre-tax cash flows would have resulted in a $52 million increase to the impairment charge recorded. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a $9 million increase to the impairment charge recorded. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the impairment related to certain of Dominion Energy’s nonregulated solar generation assets. There were no tests performed in 2024 or 2023 of long-lived assets which could have resulted in material impairments.\n\n\nHeld for Sale Classification\n\n\nDominion Energy recognizes the assets and liabilities of a disposal group as held for sale in the period (i) it has approved and committed to a plan to sell the disposal group, (ii) the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to sell the disposal group have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the disposal group is probable, (v) the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and (vi) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Dominion Energy initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until closing. Upon designation as held for sale, Dominion Energy stops recording depreciation expense and assesses the fair value of the disposal group less any costs to sell at each reporting period and until it is no longer classified as held for sale.\n\n\nThe determination as to whether the sale of the disposal group is probable may include significant judgments from management related to the expectation of obtaining approvals from applicable regulatory agencies such as state utility regulatory commissions,\n \n\n\n \n58\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFERC or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. This analysis is generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, past experience and discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel.\n\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans\n \n\n\nDominion Energy sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion Energy’s assumptions and actual experience, is immediately recognized in earnings annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as well as whenever a triggering event occurs that is determined to require remeasurement. Actuarial losses attributable to Dominion Energy’s rate regulated operations are deferred to regulatory assets when it is probable that regulators will permit them to be recovered from customers in future rates. Likewise, actuarial gains attributable to Dominion Energy’s rate regulated operations are deferred to regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds or other benefits through future rates.\n\n\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Dominion Energy determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:\n \n\n\n•\nExpected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; \n\n\n•\nHistorical return analysis to determine long-term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes; \n\n\n•\nExpected future risk premiums, asset classes’ volatilities and correlations; \n\n\n•\nForward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major capital market assumptions; and \n\n\n•\nInvestment allocation of plan assets. In December 2024, Dominion Energy revised its long-term strategic target asset allocation for its pension funds to 30% public equity (inclusive of both U.S. equity and non-U.S. equity), 27% fixed income and 43% other alternative investments, such as private equity, private debt and hedge fund investments. Through December 2024, Dominion Energy’s long-term strategic target asset allocation was 26% U.S. equity, 19% non-U.S. equity, 32% fixed income, 3% real assets and 20% other alternative investments.\n\n\nStrategic investment policies are established for Dominion Energy’s prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans’ strategic allocation are a function of Dominion Energy’s assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans’ actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the targets. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy develops its critical assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor or an independent actuary, as applicable, to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion Energy calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption that ranged from 7.00% to 8.35% for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022. For 2025, the expected long-term rate of return for the pension cost assumption is 7.35% for Dominion Energy’s plans held as of December 31, 2024. Dominion Energy calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.35% for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022. For 2025, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 7.35%.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost ranged from 5.37% to 5.75% for pension plans and 5.40% to 5.74% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2024, ranged from 5.65% to 5.75% for pension plans and 5.69% to 5.70% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2023 and ranged from 3.06% to 3.19% for pension plans and 3.04% to 5.03% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2022.

Energy’s results of operations follows:\n \n\n\n2024 VS. 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating revenue\n remained substantially consistent, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA $747 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders;\n\n\n•\nA $173 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days during the cooling season ($107 million) and an increase in heating degree days during the heating season ($66 million);\n\n\n•\nA $155 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth;\n\n\n•\nA $124 million increase from fewer outages at Millstone, including the relative effect of fewer planned outages ($100 million) and unplanned outages ($24 million);\n\n\n•\nA $90 million net increase from electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates, including settlements of economic hedges at Virginia Power prior to March 2024;\n\n\n•\nA $60 million increase in non-fuel base rates associated with the settlement of the electric base rate case in South Carolina; and\n\n\n•\nA $43 million net increase in transition service agreements primarily associated with the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions.\n\n\nThese increases were substantially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $687 million net decrease associated with market prices affecting Millstone, including economic hedging impacts of net realized and unrealized losses on freestanding derivatives ($696 million);\n\n\n \n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nA $336 million net decrease in fuel-related revenue as a result of a decrease in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization and electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates and related settlements of economic hedges at Virginia Power effective March 2024;\n\n\n•\nA $184 million decrease from the combination of certain riders into base rates at Virginia Power as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;\n\n\n•\nA $139 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors; \n\n\n•\nA $24 million decrease in fuel-related revenue as a result of a decrease in commodity costs associated with sales to gas utility customers; and\n\n\n•\nA $22 million decrease due to one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review and the electric base rate case in South Carolina.\n\n\n \n\n\nElectric fuel and other energy-related purchases\n decreased 8%, primarily due to lower commodity costs for electric utilities ($408 million), partially offset by an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits at Virginia Power ($47 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operations and maintenance\n increased 14%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA $111 million increase in certain Virginia Power expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income;\n\n\n•\nA $78 million increase in outside services;\n\n\n•\nA $71 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits;\n\n\n•\nA $63 million increase in costs associated with the business review completed in March 2024;\n\n\n•\nA $43 million increase from the combination of certain riders into base rates as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;\n\n\n•\nA $29 million increase in materials and supplies expense; and\n\n\n•\nA $25 million increase associated with an accrual for remediation costs at a manufactured gas plant site at Virginia Power.\n\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $48 million net decrease in outage costs due to lower outage costs at Millstone ($74 million) partially offset by higher outage costs at Virginia Power ($26 million); and\n\n\n•\nA $21 million decrease in bad debt expense.\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n decreased 9%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nThe absence of $244 million in amortization of a regulatory asset established in the settlement of the 2021 Triennial Review; \n\n\n•\nA $67 million decrease in amortization associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders, which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income;\n\n\n•\nA $35 million decrease due to revised estimated useful lives at Millstone; and\n\n\n•\nA $17 million decrease due to revised depreciation rates for Bath County.\n\n\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n \n\n\n•\nA $55 million increase in RGGI-related amortization, which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and\n\n\n•\nA $53 million increase due to various projects being placed into service.\n\n\n \n\n\nImpairment of assets and other charges\n increased 95%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on 100% of the CVOW Commercial Project ($206 million);\n\n\n•\nCharges for the impairment of certain nonregulated renewable natural gas facilities ($60 million);\n\n\n•\nA $55 million charge in connection with the electric base rate case in South Carolina primarily to write down certain materials and supplies inventory;\n\n\n \n62\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nA net increase in dismantling costs and other activities associated with certain retired electric generation facilities at Virginia Power ($55 million);\n\n\n•\nA charge in connection with a settlement of an agreement ($47 million); \n\n\n•\nAn increase in charges related to the revision of AROs for Millstone Unit 1 ($39 million); and\n\n\n•\nA charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs at Virginia Power ($30 million).\n\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n \n\n\n•\nA decrease in impairments of corporate office buildings ($73 million);\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge for an easement related to the CVOW Commercial Project for which Virginia Power will not seek recovery ($65 million);\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge for the write-off of certain previously deferred amounts related to the cessation of certain riders effective July 2023 ($36 million); and\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge associated with the abandonment of certain regulated solar generation and other facilities at Virginia Power ($25 million). \n\n\n \n\n\nGains on sales of assets\n decreased 96%, primarily due to the absence of a gain on the transfer of certain utility property in South Carolina.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther income\n decreased 16%, primarily due to lower market related impacts on pension and other postretirement plans ($351 million) and an increase in charitable commitments ($58 million), partially offset by an increase in net investment gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($164 million), an increase in earnings from other investments ($42 million), the absence of Dominion Energy’s share of an impairment of certain property, plant and equipment at Align RNG ($35 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($35 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest and related charges\n increased 13%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nNet issuances of long-term debt ($230 million);\n\n\n•\nLower unrealized gains in 2024 compared to 2023 associated with freestanding derivatives ($135 million);\n\n\n•\nCharges incurred due to early debt repayments associated with the business review completed in March 2024 ($20 million);\n\n\n•\nIncreased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($13 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and\n\n\n•\nHigher interest rates on commercial paper and long-term debt ($11 million).\n\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA decrease in borrowings under the 364-day term loan facilities ($105 million);\n\n\n•\nVariable rate debt repaid from business review proceeds ($69 million);\n\n\n•\nA decrease in commercial paper ($30 million); and \n\n\n•\nIncreased premiums received in 2024 compared to 2023 on interest rate derivatives ($17 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome tax expense\n decreased 46%, primarily due to lower pre-tax income ($128 million) and an increase in a nuclear production tax credit ($89 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nNet income from discontinued operations including noncontrolling interests\n increased $322 million, primarily due to the absence of charges reflecting the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of stock associated with East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas and Wexpro meeting the classification as held for sale ($835 million), a decrease in impairments associated with the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions ($197 million), the absence of depreciation expense associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions upon meeting the classification as held for sale ($211 million), the absence of interest expense on variable rate debt secured by Dominion Energy’s interest in Cove Point ($72 million), a gain upon the closing of the Questar Gas Transaction ($42 million), the absence of an impairment charge associated with the impairment of Birdseye ($34 million), the absence of charges associated with the impairment of the Madison solar project ($19 million) and the absence of an impairment charge of certain nonregulated solar assets ($11 million), partially offset by the absence of a gain on the sale of Dominion Energy’s remaining\n \n\n\n \n63\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nnoncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($348 million), the absence of earnings from operations following the closing of the East Ohio Transaction ($299 million) and Questar Gas Transaction ($138 million), the absence of equity method earnings from the sale of Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($163 million), a loss on the closing of the East Ohio Transaction ($109 million), charges for employee benefit items related to the East Ohio Transaction ($33 million), a loss on the closing of the PSNC Transaction ($31 million) and higher tax expense associated with the PSNC Transaction ($16 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nNoncontrolling interests\n decreased $53 million, due to the 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project sold to Stonepeak in October 2024, consisting of Stonepeak’s share of a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project ($103 million) partially offset by its share of the remaining earnings associated with the CVOW Commercial Project subsequent to closing.\n\n\n2023 VS. 2022\n\n\nOperating revenue \nincreased 3%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA $794 million net increase associated with market prices affecting Millstone, including economic hedging impacts of net realized and unrealized gains on freestanding derivatives ($1.1 billion);\n\n\n•\nA $298 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with Virginia Power non-fuel riders;\n\n\n•\nA $125 million net increase in fuel-related revenue as a result of an increase in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers ($223 million) and a decrease in commodity costs associated with sales to gas utility customers ($98 million);\n\n\n•\nA $102 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors;\n\n\n•\nA $66 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth; and\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a $20 million decrease associated with storm damage primarily from winter storms in Virginia.\n\n\n \n\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $212 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in heating degree days during the heating season ($148 million) and a decrease in cooling degree days during the cooling season ($64 million);\n\n\n•\nA $206 million decrease from the combination of certain riders into base rates at Virginia Power as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;\n\n\n•\nA $170 million decrease from planned outages ($94 million) and unplanned outages ($76 million) at Millstone;\n\n\n•\nA $135 million net decrease from electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates, including settlements of economic hedges at Virginia Power;\n\n\n•\nA $109 million decrease from the sale of Hope; and\n\n\n•\nA $27 million decrease in PJM off-system sales at Virginia Power.\n\n\nElectric fuel and other energy-related purchases\n increased 6%, primarily due to higher commodity costs for electric utilities ($223 million) and an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits at Virginia Power ($55 million), partially offset by a decrease in PJM off-system sales at Virginia Power ($27 million); all of which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.\n\n\nPurchased gas\n decreased 33%, primarily due to a decrease in commodity costs for gas utility operations ($98 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income, and a decrease from the sale of Hope ($43 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operations and maintenance \ndecreased 6%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA $187 million decrease in certain Virginia Power expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income;\n\n\n•\nA $100 million decrease in storm damage and restoration costs in Virginia Power’s service territory;\n\n\n•\nA $25 million decrease from the sale of Hope; and\n\n\n \n64\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nA $22 million decrease from materials and supplies expense.\n\n\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $76 million increase in outage costs at Millstone ($66 million) and Virginia Power ($10 million); \n\n\n•\nA $32 million increase from the combination of certain riders into base rates at Virginia Power as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation; and\n\n\n•\nA $30 million increase in outside services.\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and amortization \nincreased 6%, primarily due to various projects being placed into service ($159 million), partially offset by decrease due to the impairment of certain nonregulated solar generation facilities in 2022 ($19 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nImpairment of assets and other charges \ndecreased 78%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge associated with the impairment of certain nonregulated solar generation facilities ($829 million);\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge in connection with a comprehensive settlement agreement for Virginia fuel expenses ($191 million);\n\n\n•\nA net decrease in dismantling costs and other activities associated with certain retired electric generation facilities at Virginia Power ($182 million);\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge for RGGI compliance costs deemed recovered through base rates at Virginia Power ($180 million); and\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge for the write-off of inventory ($40 million).\n\n\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nThe impairment of a corporate office building ($93 million); \n\n\n•\nA charge related to the revision of AROs for Millstone Unit 1 ($83 million);\n\n\n•\nA charge for an easement related to the CVOW Commercial Project for which Virginia Power will not seek recovery ($65 million);\n\n\n•\nA charge for the write-off of certain previously deferred amounts related to the cessation of certain riders effective July 2023 ($36 million); and\n\n\n•\nA charge associated with the abandonment of certain regulated solar generation and other facilities at Virginia Power ($25 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nGains on sales of assets \nincreased $439 million, primarily due to the absence of a loss associated with the sale of Kewaunee ($649 million), partially offset by the absence of a gain on the contribution of certain privatization operations to Dominion Privatization ($155 million).\n\n\nOther income \nincreased $1.1 billion, primarily due to net investment gains in 2023 compared to net investment losses in 2022 on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($968 million) and higher market related impacts on pension and other postretirement plans ($218 million), partially offset by Dominion Energy’s share of an impairment of certain property, plant and equipment at Align RNG ($35 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest and related charges\n increased 67%, primarily due to increased commercial paper and long-term debt borrowings ($198 million), higher interest rates on commercial paper and long-term debt ($178 million), lower unrealized gains in 2023 compared to 2022 associated with freestanding derivatives ($173 million), higher interest rates on variable rate debt and cash flow interest rate swaps ($124 million), lower premiums received on interest rate derivatives ($60 million), and the absence of benefits associated with the early redemption of certain securities in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 ($35 million), partially offset by increased interest costs subject to recovery through riders ($38 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome tax expense\n increased $509 million, primarily due to higher pre-tax income ($573 million) and an increase in consolidated state deferred income taxes associated with the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and the sale of Dominion Energy’s 50% noncontrolling interest in Cove Point\n \n($29 million), partially offset by the absence of tax expense on the sale of Hope’s stock ($90 million) and decreased consolidated state deferred income taxes on pre-tax gains from nuclear decommissioning trusts and economic hedges ($12 million).\n\n\n \n\n\n \n65\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNet income from discontinued operations including noncontrolling interests\n decreased $1.0 billion, primarily due to charges reflecting the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of stock associated with East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas and Wexpro meeting the classification as held for sale that will reverse when the sale is completed ($835 million), an impairment associated with the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions ($275 million), lower unrealized gains in 2023 compared to 2022 on interest rate derivatives for economic hedging of debt secured by Dominion Energy’s interest in Cove Point ($169 million), a decrease in equity method earnings from the sale of Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($44 million), a charge associated with the impairment of Birdseye ($34 million), an increase in interest expense primarily associated with debt issuances in 2022 ($31 million), the absence of a gain associated with the Q-Pipe Group for the finalization of the working capital adjustment in the first quarter of 2022 ($20 million) and an impairment charge of certain nonregulated solar assets ($11 million), partially offset by the gain on the sale of Dominion Energy’s remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($348 million), a net decrease in charges associated with the impairment of the Madison solar project ($57 million) and an increase following the approved base rate case for Questar Gas ($42 million).\n\n\nVirginia Power\n \n\n\nPresented below is a summary of Virginia Power’s consolidated

analysis of Virginia Power’s results of operations follows:\n \n\n\n2024 VS. 2023\n\n\nOperating revenue\n increased 7%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA $747 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with non-fuel riders;\n\n\n•\nA $130 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth;\n\n\n•\nA $124 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers, primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days during the cooling season ($78 million) and an increase in heating degree days during the heating season ($46 million);\n\n\n•\nAn $85 million increase from electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates, including settlements of economic hedges prior to March 2024; and\n\n\n•\nAn $18 million increase in sales to customers from non-jurisdictional solar generation facilities.\n\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $184 million decrease from the combination of certain riders into base rates as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;\n\n\n•\nA $154 million net decrease in fuel-related revenue as a result of a decrease in commodity costs associated with sales to electric utility retail customers, including revenue for the deferred fuel securitization and electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates and related settlements of economic hedges effective March 2024;\n\n\n•\nA $122 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors; and\n\n\n•\nA $15 million decrease due to one-time credits to customers associated with the 2023 Biennial Review.\n\n\nElectric fuel and other energy-related purchases \ndecreased 6%, primarily due to lower commodity costs for electric utilities ($226 million), partially offset by an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits ($47 million), which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income.\n\n\nPurchased electric capacity\n increased 48%, primarily due to new capacity contracts and changes in existing capacity contracts.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operations and maintenance\n increased 21%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA $111 million increase in certain expenditures which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income;\n\n\n•\nA $67 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits and administrative costs;\n\n\n•\nA $48 million increase in outside services;\n\n\n•\nA $43 million increase from the combination of certain riders into base rates as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;\n\n\n•\nA $27 million increase in materials and supplies expense;\n\n\n•\nA $26 million increase in outage costs; \n\n\n•\nA $25 million increase associated with an accrual for remediation costs at a manufactured gas plant site; and \n\n\n•\nA $15 million increase in tree trimming and vegetation management.\n\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $19 million decrease in bad debt expense.\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n decreased 12%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nThe absence of $244 million in amortization of a regulatory asset established in the settlement of the 2021 Triennial Review; \n\n\n•\nA $67 million decrease in amortization associated with non-fuel riders, which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and\n\n\n•\nA $17 million decrease due to revised depreciation rates for Bath County.\n\n\n \n67\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $55 million increase in RGGI-related amortization, which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income; and\n\n\n•\nA $42 million increase due to various projects being placed into service.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther taxes\n increased 12%, primarily due to higher \nproperty taxes\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nImpairment of assets and other charges\n increased $177 million, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on 100% of the CVOW Commercial Project ($206 million);\n\n\n•\nA net increase in dismantling costs and other activities associated with certain retired electric generation facilities ($55 million); and\n\n\n•\nA charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs ($30 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge for an easement related to the CVOW Commercial Project for which Virginia Power will not seek recovery ($65 million);\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge for the write-off of certain previously deferred amounts related to the cessation of certain riders effective July 2023 ($36 million); and\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge associated with the abandonment of certain regulated solar generation and other facilities ($25 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nOther income \nincreased 49%, primarily due to an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($33 million) and an increase in net investment gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($29 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest and related charges\n increased 11%, primarily due to an increase in long-term debt borrowings ($178 million) and increased interest expense associated with rider deferrals ($13 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income, partially offset by a decrease in principal on commercial paper and intercompany borrowings with Dominion Energy ($89 million) and lower interest rates on commercial paper, long-term debt and intercompany borrowings with Dominion Energy ($23 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome tax expense \nincreased 5%, primarily due to higher pre-tax income ($106 million), partially offset by a nuclear production tax credit ($89 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nNoncontrolling interests\n decreased $53 million, due to the 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project sold to Stonepeak in October 2024, consisting of Stonepeak’s share of a charge for costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project ($103 million) partially offset by its share of the remaining earnings associated with the CVOW Commercial Project subsequent to closing.\n\n\n2023 VS. 2022\n\n\nOperating revenue\n decreased 1%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA $206 million decrease from the combination of certain riders into base rates as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation;\n\n\n•\nA $167 million decrease in sales to electric utility retail customers from a decrease in heating degree days during the heating season ($118 million) and a decrease in cooling degree days during the cooling season ($49 million);\n\n\n•\nAn $86 million net decrease from electric utility customers who elect to pay market based or other negotiated rates, including settlements of economic hedges;\n\n\n•\nA $27 million decrease in PJM off-system sales; and\n\n\n•\nA $19 million decrease from the absence of privatization operations.\n\n\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $298 million increase to recover the costs and an authorized return, as applicable, associated with non-fuel riders;\n\n\n•\nA $126 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with economic and other usage factors; and\n\n\n \n68\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nA $37 million increase in sales to electric utility retail customers associated with growth.\n\n\nElectric fuel and other energy-related purchases \nincreased $5 million, primarily due to an increase in the use of purchased renewable energy credits ($55 million), partially offset by a decrease in PJM off-system sales ($27 million); both of which are offset in operating revenue and do not impact net income and a decrease in purchased power costs ($13 million).\n\n\nOther operations and maintenance\n decreased 10%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nA $187 million decrease in certain expenses which are primarily recovered through state- and FERC-regulated rates and do not impact net income; and \n\n\n•\nA $100 million decrease in storm damage and restoration costs.  \n\n\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\n\n•\nA $56 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits and administrative costs;\n\n\n•\nA $32 million increase from the combination of certain riders into base rates as a result of 2023 Virginia legislation; \n\n\n•\nA $27 million increase in outside services; and \n\n\n•\nA $15 million increase in bad debt expense. \n\n\n \n\n\nImpairment of assets and other charges (benefits) \ndecreased 79%, primarily reflecting:\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge in connection with a comprehensive settlement agreement for Virginia fuel expenses ($191 million);\n\n\n•\nA net decrease in dismantling costs and other activities associated with certain retired electric generation facilities ($182 million);\n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge for RGGI compliance costs deemed recovered through base rates ($180 million); and\n\n\n•\nA net decrease in charges for

recovery ($65 million);\n\n\n•\nA charge for the write-off of certain previously deferred amounts related to the cessation of certain riders effective July 2023 ($36 million); and\n\n\n•\nA charge associated with the abandonment of certain regulated solar generation and other facilities ($25 million).\n\n\nOther income\n increased $131 million, primarily due to net investment gains in 2023 compared to net investment losses in 2022 on nuclear decommissioning trust funds.\n\n\nInterest and related charges \nincreased 19%, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of commercial paper and intercompany borrowings with Dominion Energy, and increased long-term debt ($124 million) and higher interest rates on commercial paper, long-term debt and intercompany borrowings with Dominion Energy ($39 million), partially offset by increased interest costs subject to recovery through riders ($38 million).\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n increased 32%, primarily due to higher pre-tax income ($117 million) and lower investment tax credits ($17 million), partially offset by the absence of the recognition of a deferred intercompany gain related to the transfer and subsequent

In 2024, this primarily included a $278 million after-tax loss associated with lower market related impacts on pension and other postretirement plans, $197 million net income from discontinued operations, primarily associated with operations included in the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions, including the loss on sale associated with the East Ohio and PSNC Transactions, as well as an impairment charge associated with the Questar Gas Transaction, $69 million in after-tax costs associated with the business review completed in March 2024 and a $27 million after-tax benefit for derivative mark-to-market changes. In 2023, this primarily included an $835 million charge to reflect the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of stock associated with East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas and Wexpro meeting the classification as held for sale that reversed when the sales were completed, $710 million net income from discontinued operations, primarily associated with operations included in the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point, including the gain on sale, as well as an impairment charge associated with the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions, a $127 million after-tax benefit for derivative mark-to-market changes, a $69 million after-tax charge associated with the impairment of a corporate office building and a $27 million after-tax benefit for higher market related impacts on pension and other postretirement plans. In 2022, this primarily included $922 million net income from discontinued operations, primarily associated with operations included in the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and Dominion Energy’s noncontrolling interest in Cove Point, a $254 million after-tax benefit for derivative mark-to-market changes, a $251 million after-tax loss for lower market related impacts on pension and other postretirement plans and a $67 million loss associated with the sale of Hope.\n\n\n \n\n\nOUTLOOK\n\n\nDominion Energy’s 2025 net income is expected to increase on a per share basis as compared to 2024 primarily from the following:\n \n\n\n•\nThe absence of a charge for Virginia Power’s share of costs not expected to be recovered from customers on the CVOW Commercial Project;\n\n\n•\nConstruction and operation of growth projects primarily in electric utility operations;\n\n\n•\nAn entire year of impacts from electric base rate cases settled in North Carolina and South Carolina;\n\n\n•\nCustomer growth;\n\n\n•\nRenewable natural gas projects placed into service; and\n\n\n•\nReturn to normal weather.\n\n\nThese increases are expected to be partially offset by the following:\n\n\n•\nThe absence of earnings from operations following the closing of the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions;\n\n\n \n73\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nAn entire year of 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project attributable to Stonepeak;\n\n\n•\nAn increase in depreciation and amortization expense;\n\n\n•\nAn increase in interest expense;\n\n\n•\nIncreased electric capacity expense;\n\n\n•\nA decrease in benefit associated with nuclear production tax credits; and\n\n\n•\nShare dilution.\n\n\n \n\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\nDominion Energy depends on both cash generated from operations and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term financings.

Net cash provided by continuing operations decreased $1.1 billion primarily due higher net prepayments and deposits ($606 million), lower deferred fuel and purchased gas cost recoveries ($464 million), settlements of interest rate swaps ($232 million), higher income tax payments ($73 million) and $169 million primarily due to lower operating cash flows from electric utility operations, partially offset by an increase from changes in working capital ($437 million).\n \n\n\nInvesting Cash Flows\n\n\nNet cash used in Dominion Energy’s investing activities decreased $4.0 billion, primarily due to net proceeds from the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions ($9.2 billion) and an increase in distributions from equity method affiliates ($125 million), partially offset by the absence of the net proceeds from the sale of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point ($3.3 billion), an increase in plant construction and other property additions ($2.0 billion) and higher acquisitions of solar development projects ($205 million).\n\n\nFinancing Cash Flows\n\n\nNet cash from Dominion Energy’s financing activities decreased $2.4 billion, primarily due to a $9.5 billion decrease due to net repayments on 364-day term loan facilities in 2024 versus net issuances in 2023, net repayments of short-term debt ($2.0 billion), the repurchase and redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock ($801 million) and net repayment of supplemental credit facility borrowings ($450 million), partially offset by a $6.8 billion increase due to net issuances of long-term debt in 2024 versus net repayments in 2023, an increase from the sale of a noncontrolling interest in, as well as capital contributions from Stonepeak to, OSWP ($2.9 billion) and an increase in the issuance of common stock ($638 million).\n\n\n \n74\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCredit Facilities and Short-Term Debt\n\n\nDominion Energy generally uses proceeds from short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, to satisfy short-term cash requirements not met through cash from operations. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending on the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. A description of Dominion Energy’s primary available sources of short-term liquidity follows.\n \n\n\nJoint Revolving Credit Facility\n\n\nDominion Energy maintains a $6.0 billion joint revolving credit facility which provides for a discount in the pricing of certain annual fees and amounts borrowed by Dominion Energy under the facility if Dominion Energy achieves certain annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion objectives.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy’s commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under its credit facility were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFacility Limit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOutstanding Commercial Paper\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOutstanding Letters of Credit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFacility Capacity Available\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint revolving credit facility\n(2)(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,061\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,929\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominion Energy’s credit facility was 4.74% at December 31, 2024.\n\n\n(2)\nThis credit facility matures in June 2026, with the potential to be extended by the borrowers to June 2028, and can be used by the borrowers under the credit facility to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to a combined $2.0 billion of letters of credit.\n\n\n(3)\nIn May 2024, the joint revolving credit facility was amended to remove Questar Gas as a co-borrower.\n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy Reliability Investment\nSM\n Program\n\n\nDominion Energy has an effective registration statement with the SEC for the sale of up to $3.0 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability Investment\nSM\n. The registration statement limits the principal amount that may be outstanding at any one time to $1.0 billion. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Dominion Energy Reliability Investment Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Dominion Energy or at the investor’s option at any time. At December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include $439 million presented within short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.50%. The proceeds are used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Facilities\n\n\nIn addition to the primary sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, from time to time Dominion Energy enters into separate supplementary credit facilities or term loans as discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \n\n\nIn March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full $2.5 billion outstanding under its $2.5 billion 364-day term loan facility entered into in January 2023 as amended in January 2024, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. The debt was scheduled to mature in July 2024.\n\n\nIn March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid $1.8 billion of its $2.25 billion 364-day term loan facility entered into in October 2023, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. Subsequently in March 2024, Dominion Energy requested and received a $500 million increase to the amount of the facility and concurrently borrowed $500 million with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In May 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full $976 million outstanding under the facility, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the Questar Gas Transaction. The debt was scheduled to mature in October 2024.\n \n\n\nLong-Term Debt\n\n\nSustainability Revolving Credit Agreement\n\n\nDominion Energy maintains a $900 million Sustainability Revolving Credit Agreement which, following an amendment in June 2024, matures in June 2025, bears interest at a variable rate and is described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The facility offers a reduced interest rate margin with respect to borrowed amounts allocated to certain environmental sustainability or social investment initiatives. In May 2024, Dominion Energy used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Series A\n \n\n\n \n75\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJSNs and the 2024 Series B JSNs to repay the outstanding balance of $450 million under the Sustainability Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\n\nIssuances and Borrowings of Long-Term Debt\n\n\nDuring 2024, Dominion Energy issued or borrowed the following long-term debt. Unless otherwise noted, the proceeds were used for the repayment of existing long-term indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information including use of proceeds and repayment provisions on the securitization bonds issued in February 2024 and the use of proceeds on the 2024 Series A JSNs and 2024 Series B JSNs issued in May 2024.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\n\n\n \n\n\nType\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic / Private\n\n\n \n\n\nEntity\n\n\n \n\n\nPrincipal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStated Maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.000\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2034\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.350\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2054\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior secured deferred fuel cost bonds\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nVPFS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n439\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.088\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior secured deferred fuel cost bonds\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nVPFS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n843\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.877\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2033\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\n \n\n\nJunior subordinated notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.875\n\n\n%\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n2055\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\n \n\n\nJunior subordinated notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.000\n\n\n%\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n2054\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPrivate\n\n\n \n\n\nPSNC\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n150\n\n\n \n\n\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n5.650\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2034\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPrivate\n\n\n \n\n\nPSNC\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n150\n\n\n \n\n\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n6.040\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2054\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n600\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.050\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2034\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nVirginia Power\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n600\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.550\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2054\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember\n\n\n \n\n\nJunior subordinated notes\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic\n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.625\n\n\n%\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n2055\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal issuances and borrowings\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nRates subject to periodic reset as described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n(2)\nThe senior notes issued by PSNC were assumed by Enbridge upon closing of the PSNC Transaction in September 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn January 2025, DESC issued $450 million of 5.30% first mortgage bonds that mature in 2035. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and/or to repay short-term debt.\n\n\nDominion Energy currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion Energy to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.\n\n\nDominion Energy anticipates, excluding potential opportunistic financings, issuing between approximately $5.5 billion and $8.0 billion of long-term debt during 2025, inclusive of the issuance of bonds at DESC discussed above. Dominion Energy expects to issue long-term debt to satisfy cash needs for capital expenditures, net of reimbursements from Stonepeak for the CVOW Commercial Project, and maturing long-term debt to the extent such amounts are not satisfied from cash available from operations following the payment of dividends and any borrowings made from unused capacity of Dominion Energy’s credit facilities discussed above. The raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.\n\n\nRepayments, Repurchases and Redemptions of Long-Term Debt\n\n\nDominion Energy may from time to time reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity or repurchases of debt securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.\n \n\n\nThe following long-term debt was repaid, repurchased or redeemed in 2024:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\n\n\n \n\n\nType\n\n\n \n\n\nEntity\n\n\n \n\n\nPrincipal\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\n\n\nRate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStated Maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt scheduled to mature in 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,429\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nvarious\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly repurchases & redemptions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\n \n\n\nSenior secured notes\n\n\n \n\n\nEagle Solar\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n279\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.820\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2042\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\n \n\n\nTax-exempt bonds\n\n\n \n\n\nDETC\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.800\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2033\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\n \n\n\nJunior subordinated notes\n\n\n \n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n685\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.750\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n2054\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal repayments, repurchases and redemptions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,420\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n76\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nTotal amount redeemed prior to maturity includes remaining outstanding principal plus accrued interest.\n\n\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding scheduled maturities and other cancellations of Dominion Energy’s long-term debt, including related average interest rates.\n\n\nRemarketing of Long-Term Debt\n\n\nIn May 2024, Virginia Power remarketed three series of tax-exempt bonds, with an aggregate outstanding principal of $243 million to new investors. All three series of bonds will bear interest at a coupon of 3.80% until May 2027, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn 2025, Dominion Energy expects to remarket approximately $225 million of its tax-exempt bonds.\n\n\nCredit Ratings\n\n\nDominion Energy’s credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities. The credit ratings for Dominion Energy are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.\n\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks as of February 20, 2025 are as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMoody’s\n\n\n \n\n\nStandard & Poor’s\n\n\n \n\n\nFitch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate/Issuer\n\n\n \n\n\nBaa2\n\n\n \n\n\nBBB+\n\n\n \n\n\nBBB+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior unsecured debt securities\n\n\n \n\n\nBaa2\n\n\n \n\n\nBBB\n\n\n \n\n\nBBB+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJunior subordinated notes\n\n\n \n\n\nBaa3\n\n\n \n\n\nBBB-\n\n\n \n\n\nBBB-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferred stock\n\n\n \n\n\nBa1\n\n\n \n\n\nBBB-\n\n\n \n\n\nBBB-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial paper\n\n\n \n\n\nP-2\n\n\n \n\n\nA-2\n\n\n \n\n\nF2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutlook\n\n\n \n\n\nStable\n\n\n \n\n\nStable\n\n\n \n\n\nStable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating organization.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFinancial Covenants\n\n\nAs part of borrowing funds and issuing both short-term and long-term debt or preferred securities, Dominion Energy must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain customary covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion Energy.\n\n\nDominion Energy is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain its joint revolving credit facility. In addition, the credit agreement contains various terms and conditions that could affect Dominion Energy’s ability to borrow under the facility. They include a maximum debt to total capital ratio, which is also included in Dominion Energy’s Sustainability Revolving Credit Agreement entered into in 2021 and amended in June 2024, and cross-default provisions.\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\n \n\n\nMaximum Allowed Ratio\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActual Ratio\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominion Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n54.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nIndebtedness as defined by the agreements excludes certain junior subordinated notes and securitization bonds reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n77\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIf Dominion Energy or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominion Energy’s joint revolving credit facility, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facility. In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominion Energy’s obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facility could also be accelerated and the lenders’ commitments to Dominion Energy could terminate.\n \n\n\nDominion Energy monitors compliance with these covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2024, there have been no events of default under Dominion Energy’s covenants.\n\n\nCommon Stock, Preferred Stock and Other Equity Securities\n\n\nIssuances of Equity Securities\n\n\nDominion Energy maintains Dominion Energy Direct\n®\n and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions may be invested in Dominion Energy’s common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. In August 2023, Dominion Energy began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these direct stock purchase plans, and in March 2024, began issuing new shares of common stock. During 2024, Dominion Energy issued 2.7 million of such shares and received proceeds of $138 million.\n\n\nDominion Energy also maintains sales agency agreements to effect sales under an at-the-market program. Under the sales agency agreements, Dominion Energy is able, from time to time, to offer and sell shares of its common stock through the sales agents or enter into one or more forward sale agreements with respect to shares of its common stock. In May 2024, Dominion Energy entered into sales agency agreements to effect sales under a new at-the-market program, and through August 2024 entered forward sale agreements for approximately 11.4 million shares of its common stock at a weighted-average initial forward price of $53.23 per share. In December 2024, Dominion Energy provided notice to elect physical settlement of the forward sale agreements and in December 2024 settled the agreements at a weighted-average final forward price of $52.20 and received total proceeds of $594 million. Additionally, from September through December 2024, Dominion Energy entered forward sale agreements for approximately 9.7 million shares of its common stock expected to be settled in the fourth quarter of 2025 at a weighted-average initial forward price of $57.78 per share.\n\n\nDominion Energy expects to issue equity through programs such as Dominion Energy Direct\n®\n and employee savings plans of approximately $200 million in 2025. In addition, Dominion Energy expects to issue equity, excluding potential opportunistic offerings, through an at-the-market program, including any related forward-sale agreements, of approximately $800 million to $1.0 billion in 2025, inclusive of the shares expected to settle in the fourth quarter of 2025 discussed above. The raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.\n\n\nRepurchases and Redemptions of Equity Securities\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2024, Dominion Energy completed a tender offer repurchasing 0.4 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and in December 2024 redeemed the remaining 0.4 million shares outstanding.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn November 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Dominion Energy’s common stock. This repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price or volume targets and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at the discretion of management subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors. At December 31, 2024, Dominion Energy had $920 million of available capacity under this authorization.\n\n\nDominion Energy does not plan to repurchase shares of common stock in 2025, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which does not impact the available capacity under its stock repurchase authorization.\n\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\n\nSee Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Dominion Energy’s historical capital expenditures by segment. In February 2025, Dominion Energy announced an updated $50.1 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025 through 2029, which includes the impact of Stonepeak’s 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project, representing significant investments in reliable,\n \n\n\n \n78\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naffordable and increasingly clean energy to advance an “all-of-the-above” strategy to address projected demand growth.

See Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and Contracted Energy in Item 1. Business for additional discussion of various significant capital projects currently under development. The above estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion Energy’s Board of Directors in early 2025 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment. Actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. Dominion Energy may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDividends\n\n\nDominion Energy believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In December 2024, Dominion Energy’s Board of Directors established an annual dividend rate for 2025 of $2.67 per share of common stock, consistent with the 2024 rate. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In January 2025, Dominion Energy’s Board of Directors declared dividends payable in March 2025 of 66.75 cents per share of common stock.\n\n\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Dominion Energy’s outstanding preferred stock and associated dividend rates.\n\n\nSubsidiary Dividend Restrictions\n\n\nCertain of Dominion Energy’s subsidiaries may, from time to time, be subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulators or financing arrangements on their ability to pay dividends, or to advance or repay funds, to Dominion Energy. At December 31, 2024, these restrictions did not have a significant impact on Dominion Energy’s ability to pay dividends on its common or preferred stock or meet its other cash obligations.\n \n\n\nSee Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of such restrictions and any other restrictions on Dominion Energy’s ability to pay dividends.\n\n\nCollateral and Credit Risk\n\n\nCollateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion Energy’s credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties. In connection with commodity hedging activities, Dominion Energy is required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, Dominion Energy may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, Dominion Energy may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which Dominion Energy can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.\n\n\nDominion Energy’s exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion Energy’s credit exposure as of December 31, 2024 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n79\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGross Credit\nExposure\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCredit\nCollateral\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNet Credit\nExposure\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment grade\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n83\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n83\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Investment grade\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo external ratings:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternally rated—investment grade\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternally rated—non-investment grade\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n(5)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n174\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n172\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nDesignations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.

In addition to the items already discussed, the following represent material expected cash requirements recorded on Dominion Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024.\n \nSuch obligations include:\n \n\n\n•\nOperating and financing lease obligations – See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; \n\n\n•\nRegulatory liabilities – See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; \n\n\n•\nAROs – See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and \n\n\n•\nEmployee benefit plan obligations – See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, Dominion Energy is party to contracts and arrangements which may require it to make material cash payments in future years that are not recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Such obligations include:\n\n\n•\nOff-balance sheet leasing arrangements – See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and\n\n\n•\nGuarantees – See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nFUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS\n\n\nSee Item 1. Business and Notes 13 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\n \n\n\n \n80\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFuture Environmental Regulations\n\n\nClimate Change\n \n\n\nThe federal government and states in which Dominion Energy operates have announced various commitments to achieving carbon reduction goals. In February 2021, the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement, which establishes a universal framework for addressing GHG emissions. In January 2025, the U.S. announced its intention to withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. States may enact legislation relating to climate change matters such as the reduction of GHG emissions and renewable energy portfolio standards, similar to the VCEA. To the extent legislation is enacted at the federal or state level that is more restrictive than the VCEA and/or Dominion Energy’s commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, compliance with such legislation could have a material impact to Dominion Energy’s financial condition and/or cash flows.\n\n\n \n\n\nInflation Reduction Act\n\n\nThe IRA includes provisions which impose an annual fee for waste methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry beginning with emissions reported in calendar year 2024 to the extent that an entity’s emissions exceed a stated threshold, with implementation to be addressed by future rulemaking by the EPA. Pending the completion of such rulemaking, Dominion Energy currently does not expect these provisions to materially affect its future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\n\n\n \n\n\nRecently Issued EPA Rules\n\n\nIn May 2024, the EPA released a final rule to tighten aspects of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Risk and Technology Review, including the reduction of emissions limits for filterable particulate matter, and requiring the use of continuous emissions monitoring systems to demonstrate compliance. In May 2024, the EPA finalized a package of rules designed to reduce CO\n2\n emissions from certain fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The final rule sets standards of performance and emission guidelines for CO\n2\n emissions from new and reconstructed gas-fired combustion turbines and modified coal-fired steam generating units. The rulemaking package also includes emission guidelines, including emission limits, for existing coal, oil and gas-fired steam generating units. In addition, in March 2024, the EPA published a final rule strengthening the national air quality annual standard for fine particulate matter. Further, Dominion Energy anticipates that the EPA will release additional rulemakings as part of an overall strategy to identify and mitigate PFAS exposure, beyond the national drinking water standards for PFAS issued in April 2024. Until specific state implementation plans are developed for final rules and/or Dominion Energy has sufficient time to develop implementation strategies for these final rules, Dominion Energy is unable to predict whether or to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls or other actions. The expenditures required to implement additional controls or other actions could have a material impact on Dominion Energy’s financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nDodd-Frank Act\n\n\nThe CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk may elect the end-user exception to the CEA’s clearing requirements. Dominion Energy utilizes the end-user exception with respect to its swaps. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, Dominion Energy can no longer utilize the end-user exception or otherwise becomes subject to mandatory clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominion Energy’s swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to the rulemaking process. Due to the evolving rulemaking process, Dominion Energy is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act’s derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n\n \n\n\nNorth Anna\n\n\nVirginia Power is considering the construction of a third nuclear unit at a site located at North Anna. If Virginia Power decides to build a new unit, it would require a Combined Construction Permit and Operating License from the NRC, approval of the Virginia Commission and certain environmental permits and other approvals. In June 2017, the NRC issued the Combined Construction Permit and Operating License. Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit at North Anna.\n\n\n \n\n\nFederal Income Tax Laws\n\n\nInflation Reduction Act\n\n\nThe IRA imposes a 15% alternative minimum tax on GAAP net income, as adjusted for certain items, of corporations in excess of $1 billion, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. Entities that are subject to the alternative minimum tax may use tax credits to\n \n\n\n \n81\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreduce the liability by up to 75% and will receive a tax credit carryforward with an indefinite life that can be claimed against the regular tax in future years. Pending final guidance, the alternative minimum tax is not expected to have an effect on the assessment of the realizability of Dominion Energy’s deferred tax assets or a material impact on Dominion Energy’s future results of operations or cash flows.\n\n\nTax Repairs Guidance\n\n\nIn April 2023, the IRS issued safe harbor guidance to taxpayers on the treatment of amounts paid to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas distribution property, including whether expenditures should be deducted as repairs or capitalized and depreciated on tax returns. The guidance includes safe harbor tax accounting methods which a taxpayer may choose to elect and provides special transition rules and incentives that vary depending on which tax year is the year of change. Dominion Energy is evaluating this guidance and while it cannot currently estimate the potential financial statement impacts, it does not expect a material impact to its results of operations.\n\n\n \n82",
