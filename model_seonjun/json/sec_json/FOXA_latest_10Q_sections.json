This section should be read together with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, (“fiscal”) 2025 as filed with the SEC on August 6, 2025 (the “2025 Form 10-K”). The Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements are referred to as the “Financial Statements” herein.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. This discussion is organized as follows:\n•\nOverview of the Company’s Business\n—This section provides a general description of the Company’s businesses, as well as developments that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 that the Company believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or to disclose known trends.\n•\nResults of Operations\n—This section provides an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated and a segment basis. In addition, a brief description is provided of significant transactions and events that impact the comparability of the results being analyzed.\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resource\ns\n—This section provides an analysis of the Company’s cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, as well as a discussion of the Company’s outstanding debt and commitments, both firm and contingent, that existed as of September 30, 2025. Included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund the Company’s future commitments and obligations, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.\n•\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n—This section provides a description of the use of forward-looking information appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Such information is based on management’s current expectations about future events which are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties. Refer to Part I., Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in the 2025 Form 10-K for a discussion of the risk factors applicable to the Company.\nOVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS\nThe Company is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in four operating segments: Cable Network Programming, Television, Credible and the FOX Studio Lot with the following two reportable segments:\n•\nCable Network Programming\n, which produces and licenses news and sports content distributed through traditional cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies (“traditional MVPDs”), virtual multi-channel video programming distributors (“virtual MVPDs”) and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S.\n•\nTelevision\n, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes programming through the FOX broadcast network, advertising-supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”) service Tubi, 29 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. Eighteen of the broadcast television stations are affiliated with the FOX Network and 11 are affiliated with MyNetworkTV. The segment also includes various production companies that produce content for the Company and third parties.\nThe Credible and the FOX Studio Lot operating segments do not meet the criteria under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to be separately reported as a reportable segment or aggregated with other operating segments, and as such are presented as part of Corporate and Other, which is not a reportable segment. Corporate and Other principally consists of FOX One, the Company’s direct-to-consumer subscription \n19\nstreaming service launched in August 2025, Credible, the FOX Studio Lot and corporate overhead costs. The FOX Studio Lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility.\nWe use the term \"MVPDs\" to refer collectively to traditional MVPDs and virtual MVPDs.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations—For the three months ended September 30, 2025 versus the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s operating results for the three\n \nmonths ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n \nFor the three months ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\nDistribution\n(a)\n$\n1,915 \n$\n1,868 \n$\n47 \n3 \n%\nAdvertising\n1,412 \n1,329 \n83 \n6 \n%\nContent and other\n411 \n367 \n44 \n12 \n%\nTotal revenues\n3,738 \n3,564 \n174 \n5 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(2,084)\n(2,018)\n(66)\n(3)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(589)\n(502)\n(87)\n(17)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n(98)\n(91)\n(7)\n(8)\n%\nRestructuring, impairment and other corporate matters\n8 \n(26)\n34 \n**\nEquity (losses) earnings of affiliates\n(1)\n3 \n(4)\n**\nInterest expense, net\n(50)\n(50)\n— \n— \n%\nNon-operating other, net\n(125)\n233 \n(358)\n**\nIncome before income tax expense\n799 \n1,113 \n(314)\n(28)\n%\nIncome tax expense\n(190)\n(281)\n91 \n32 \n%\nNet income\n609 \n832 \n(223)\n(27)\n%\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(10)\n(5)\n(5)\n(100)\n%\nNet income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders\n$\n599 \n$\n827 \n$\n(228)\n(28)\n%\n(a)\nThe Company generates distribution revenue from agreements with MVPDs for cable network programming and retransmission fees for the broadcast of the Company’s owned and operated television stations and from subscription fees for the Company’s direct-to-consumer streaming services. In addition, the Company generates distribution revenue from agreements with independently owned television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network.\n**\nnot meaningful\nOverview\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nThe Company’s revenues increased $174 million or 5% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, due to higher distribution, advertising and content and other revenues. The increase of $47 million or 3% in distribution revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network of approximately $155 million, partially offset by the approximately $110 million impact of a lower average number of subscribers. The increase of $83 million or 6% in advertising revenue was primarily due to the approximately $185 million impact principally due to continued digital growth led by the Tubi AVOD service, \n20\nhigher news pricing and higher sports pricing and ratings, partially offset by the approximately $100 million impact of lower political advertising revenue due to the absence of the 2024 presidential and congressional elections. The increase of $44 million or 12% in content and other revenues was primarily due to higher entertainment content revenue and higher sports sublicensing revenue.\nOperating expenses increased $66 million or 3% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, primarily due to the approximately $80 million impact of higher entertainment programming rights amortization and digital content costs. This increase was offset by approximately $15 million primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and lower newsgathering costs led by the absence of the 2024 presidential election.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $87 million or 17% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, primarily due to costs associated with the marketing of the launch of FOX One and higher employee costs.\nRestructuring, impairment and other corporate matters\n—See Note 11—Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Restructuring, Impairment and Other Corporate Matters.”\nNon-operating other, net\n—See Note 11—Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Non-Operating Other, net.”\nIncome tax expense\n—The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 24% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes partially offset by other permanent items.\nThe Company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes.\nNet income\n—Net income decreased $223 million or 27% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, primarily due to a change in fair value of the Company’s investments in equity securities, partially offset by lower provision for income tax.\nSegment Analysis\nThe Company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is Segment EBITDA (defined below). Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. Intersegment transactions principally relate to the sublicensing of sports content, direct-to-consumer streaming services and rental of studio and administrative space, which are recorded consistently with the recognition of transactions with third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.\nSegment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Equity earnings (losses) of affiliates, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense. Effective July 1, 2025, the Company no longer removes the impact of amortization of cable distribution investments when calculating Segment EBITDA. Prior periods were not restated as the impact of the change is immaterial to the calculation. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s operating segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, to monitor actual versus budget and prior fiscal year financial results, forecast future periods and perform competitive analyses to evaluate performance and allocate resources.\n21\nThe following tables set forth the Company’s Revenues and Segment EBITDA for the three\n \nmonths ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n \nFor the three months ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\nCable Network Programming\n$\n1,662 \n$\n1,597 \n$\n65 \n4 \n%\nTelevision\n2,050 \n1,953 \n97 \n5 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n89 \n65 \n24 \n37 \n%\nEliminations\n(63)\n(51)\n(12)\n(24)\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,738 \n$\n3,564 \n$\n174 \n5 \n%\n \nFor the three months ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nSegment EBITDA\nCable Network Programming\n$\n800 \n$\n748 \n$\n52 \n7 \n%\nTelevision\n399 \n372 \n27 \n7 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n(134)\n(72)\n(62)\n(86)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(a)\n$\n1,065 \n$\n1,048 \n$\n17 \n2 \n%\n(a)\nFor a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nCable Network Programming\n (44% and 45% of the Company’s revenues for the first three months of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively)\n \nFor the three months ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\n \n \nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\nDistribution\n$\n1,090 \n$\n1,062 \n$\n28 \n3 \n%\nAdvertising\n345 \n321 \n24 \n7 \n%\nContent and other\n227 \n214 \n13 \n6 \n%\nTotal revenues\n1,662 \n1,597 \n65 \n4 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(703)\n(702)\n(1)\n— \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(159)\n(151)\n(8)\n(5)\n%\nAmortization of cable distribution investments\n— \n4 \n(4)\n(100)\n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n800 \n$\n748 \n$\n52 \n7 \n%\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\n \nRevenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased $65 million or 4% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, due to\n \nhigher distribution, advertising and content and other revenues. Distribution revenue increased $28 million or 3% as higher average rates per subscriber were partially offset by a decrease in the average number of subscribers. The increase of $24 million or 7% in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher news pricing partially offset by \n22\nthe absence of the broadcast of CONMEBOL \nCopa América \nin the current year. The increase of $13 million or 6% in content and other revenues was primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenue.\nCable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased $52 million or 7% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased $1 million primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs led by international soccer rights acquired in the current year. This increase was largely offset by lower newsgathering costs led by the absence of the 2024 presidential election. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8 million or 5% primarily due to higher employee costs.\nTelevision\n (55%\n \nof the Company’s revenues for the first three months of fiscal 2026 and 2025)\n \nFor the three months ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\nAdvertising\n$\n1,067 \n$\n1,008 \n$\n59 \n6 \n%\nDistribution\n821 \n806 \n15 \n2 \n%\nContent and other\n162 \n139 \n23 \n17 \n%\nTotal revenues\n2,050 \n1,953 \n97 \n5 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(1,385)\n(1,333)\n(52)\n(4)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(266)\n(248)\n(18)\n(7)\n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n399 \n$\n372 \n$\n27 \n7 \n%\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nRevenues at the Television segment increased $97 million or 5% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, due to higher advertising, distribution and content and other revenues. The increase of $59 million or 6% in advertising revenue was primarily due to continued digital growth led by the Tubi AVOD service and higher sports pricing and ratings led by the National Football League, partially offset by lower political advertising revenue principally due to the absence of the 2024 presidential and congressional elections. The increase of $15 million or 2% in distribution revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers at the Company’s owned and operated television stations and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network. The increase of $23 million or 17% in content and other revenues was primarily due to higher entertainment content revenue led by the timing of deliveries.\nTelevision Segment EBITDA increased $27 million or 7% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased $52 million or 4% primarily due to higher entertainment programming rights amortization and higher digital content costs. This increase was partially offset by lower sports programming rights amortization primarily due to the absence of WWE and the broadcast of the Union of European Football Associations \nEuropean Championship\n. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $18 million or 7% primarily due to higher employee costs.\n23\nCorporate and Other\n \nFor the three months ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\n \n \nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\n$\n89 \n$\n65 \n$\n24 \n37 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(45)\n(20)\n(25)\n**\nSelling, general and administrative\n(178)\n(117)\n(61)\n(52)\n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n(134)\n$\n(72)\n$\n(62)\n(86)\n%\n**\nnot meaningful\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nRevenues within Corporate and Other for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 include revenues generated by Credible, the operation of the FOX Studio Lot and distribution revenue at FOX One. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 include advertising and promotional expenses at Credible and costs associated with the launch of FOX One. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 primarily relate to employee costs, professional fees, FOX One marketing costs and the costs of operating the FOX Studio Lot. Corporate and Other EBITDA decreased $62 million or 86% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2025, primarily due to costs associated with the launch of FOX One, led by marketing costs, which more than offset related distribution revenue.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Equity earnings (losses) of affiliates, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense. Effective July 1, 2025, the Company no longer removes the impact of amortization of cable distribution investments when calculating Adjusted EBITDA. Prior periods were not restated as the impact of the change is immaterial to the calculation.\nManagement believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company’s Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company’s business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).\nAdjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n24\nThe following table reconciles Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n \nFor the three months ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \n(in millions) \nNet income\n$\n609 \n$\n832 \nAdd\nAmortization of cable distribution investments\n— \n4 \nDepreciation and amortization\n98 \n91 \nRestructuring, impairment and other corporate matters\n(8)\n26 \nEquity losses (earnings) of affiliates\n1 \n(3)\nInterest expense, net\n50 \n50 \nNon-operating other, net\n125 \n(233)\nIncome tax expense\n190 \n281 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,065 \n$\n1,048 \nThe following table sets forth the computation of Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n \nFor the three months ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \n(in millions) \nRevenues\n$\n3,738 \n$\n3,564 \nOperating expenses\n(2,084)\n(2,018)\nSelling, general and administrative\n(589)\n(502)\nAmortization of cable distribution investments\n— \n4 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,065 \n$\n1,048 \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Financial\n \nCondition\nThe Company has approximately $4.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2025 and an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (See Note 5—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements).
