  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n \nOverview\nC.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson,” “the company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is one of the largest global logistics providers in the world, with consolidated total revenues of $17.7 billion in 2024. We deliver logistics like no one else. Companies around the world look to us to reimagine supply chains, advance freight technology and solve logistics challenges\n—\nfrom the simple to the complex. We are grounded in our\n \npromise to deliver exceptional customer success, using our expertise, scale and tailored solutions to help customers navigate increasingly complex global supply chains.\nOperating throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, South America, and the Middle East, we help ensure the seamless delivery of goods across industries and continents. Our global suite of multimodal logistics services brings together the expertise of our people with custom technology differentiated by one of the largest datasets on shipments, routings, and carriers in the world. \nThe Robinson Operating Model is the foundation of our strategy, execution, and accountability throughout the organization. Rooted in Lean principles, it has elevated our team and leaders to focus on accelerated opportunity identification and operational effectiveness in delivering value to our customers. Leveraging our rich datasets supported by the framework of the Robinson Operating Model, our culture has embraced a disciplined approach to continuous improvement and speed of decision making.\nAs one of the world’s largest logistics platforms, our proprietary technology connects \n83,000 \ncustomers and \n450,000 \ncarriers. We work closely with a global network of transportation companies, including contracted motor carriers, railroads, and ocean and air carriers. We utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost-effectively arrange the transport of our customers’ freight. In 2024, our customers trusted us to manage approximately \n37 million\n shipments and \n$23 billion\n in freight. As an integral part of our transportation services, we also provide a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as freight consolidation, drop trailer, cross-border logistics, customs brokerage and trade compliance, supply chain consulting and design, and fully managed third-party logistics (“3PL”) and fourth-party logistics (“4PL”) solutions.\nO\nur global team of supply chain experts, differentiated technology, and integrated product portfolio across ocean, air, rail, and truck shipping bring unique value to the marketplace. Our global perspective across all links in the supply chain are critical in supporting shippers through market volatility and global supply chain disruptions. We are also a key driver of digital transformation in our industry. Our innovations with artificial intelligence (“\nAI\n”), machine learning, and data science benefit our customers and help power our growth strategy. We are expanding the use of generative AI in our industry, creating proprietary technology to perform work that defied automation for decades. Our customers get better service, faster speed-to-market and more cost savings, while our people are freed from repetitive, mundane tasks so they can focus on more strategic work. Our enhancements to our dynamic costing and pricing models are key contributors to expanding our operating margins and growing volume and market share.\nIn addition to transportation and logistics services, we also provide sourcing services under the trade name Robinson Fresh\n®\n (“Robinson Fresh”). Our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added perishable items. The foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to this original business, founded in 1905, which gives us significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities. We supply fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers. Our customers include grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers. In many cases, we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services, such as replenishment, category management, and managed procurement services. We have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and value-added produce under recognized consumer brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements. We have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers.\nSegment information. \nWe have two reportable segments, North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”) and Global Forwarding, with our remaining operating segments reported as All Other and Corporate. The All Other and Corporate segment includes Robinson Fresh, Managed Solutions, Other Surface Transportation outside of North America, and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. See additional disclosure in Note 8, \nSegment Reporting\n, to our consolidated financial statements. \nNAST provides transportation and logistics services across North America through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The primary services provided by NAST include truckload and less than truckload (“LTL”) transportation brokerage services.\n3\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Forwarding provides transportation and logistics services through an international network of offices in North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, South America, and the Middle East and also contracts with independent agents worldwide. The primary services provided by Global Forwarding include ocean freight services, air freight services, and customs brokerage. \nRobinson Fresh provides sourcing services that primarily include the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added perishable items. Robinson Fresh sources products from around the world. \nIn November 2024, we launched C.H. Robinson Managed Solutions™ to address a growing gap in the marketplace for shippers wanting seamless access to 4PL services, 3PL, managed transportation and Transportation Management Services (“TMS”) technology from one provider. Consulting services, logistics optimization, and day-to-day logistics management services formerly offered through our TMC division are now offered through Managed Solutions.\nOther Surface Transportation revenues are primarily earned by our Europe Surface Transportation operating segment. Europe Surface Transportation provides transportation and logistics services, including truckload and LTL transportation services, across Europe. The sale of our Europe Surface Transportation business was announced in July 2024 and closed in February 2025.\nSales\nTransportation and Logistics Services\nC.H. Robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services. Our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships. We execute these services by investing in and retaining talented employees, developing innovative proprietary systems and processes, and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers, including, but not limited to, contracted motor carriers, railroads, and ocean and air carriers. We make a profit that is driven by the value we provide our customers and the resulting difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to transport the freight. \nWe provide the following transportation and logistics services:\n•\nTruckload: Through our contracts with motor carriers, we have access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, flatbeds, and bulk capacity. Through the use of our proprietary Navisphere platform\n®\n, we connect our customers with contracted motor carriers that specialize in their transportation lanes and product types, and we help contracted motor carriers optimize the usage of their equipment. \n•\nLTL: LTL transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight. We primarily focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger, although we handle any size shipment. Through our contracts with motor carriers and the use of Navisphere, we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight. In many instances, we consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads.\n•\nOcean: As a licensed Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”) and freight forwarder, we consolidate shipments, determine routing, select ocean carriers, contract for ocean shipments, and/or provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments.\n•\nAir: As a certified Indirect Air Carrier (“IAC”) and freight forwarder, we organize air shipments and provide door-to-door service.\n•\nCustoms: Our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other authoritative governmental agencies to assist importers and exporters in meeting regulatory and operational requirements governing imports and exports. \n•\nOther Logistics Services: We provide intermodal transportation service, which is the shipment of freight in containers or trailers by a combination of truck and rail. In addition, we provide fee-based Managed Solutions, warehousing services, and other services.\nCustomers communicate their freight needs, typically on an order-by-order basis, to the C.H. Robinson team responsible for their account, either directly or through highly automated connections established between Navisphere and the customers’ transportation management system. The C.H. Robinson team then ensures all necessary information regarding each shipment is available in Navisphere. We utilize the information from Navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based on factors such as their service score, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. \n4\nTable of Contents\nOnce the contracted carrier is selected, we receive the contracted carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation. During the time when a shipment is executed, we connect frequently, either electronically or manually, with the contracted carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers. \nFor most of our transportation and logistics services, we are a service provider. By accepting the customer’s order, we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. The carrier’s contract is with us, not the customer, and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges. In cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit, we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims. In our Managed Solutions business, we are often acting as the shipper’s agent. In those cases, the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer, and we collect a fee for our services.\nAs a result of our logistics capabilities, our technology, our global suite of services, and integrated modes of transportation, some of our customers have us handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight transportation needs. Our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer. Our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market, or transactional basis, or prearranged contractual rates. Most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation. As is typical in the transportation industry, most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments. When we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers, we usually have fuel surcharge agreements that allow for fuel to primarily act as a pass-through cost, in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate.\nWe purchase most of our truckload services from our contracted truckload carriers on a spot market, or transactional basis, even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis. In some cases, we may get advance commitments from one or more contracted motor carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract or to provide transportation services within dense transportation lanes. In those cases, where we have prearranged rates with contracted motor carriers, there is typically a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreed-upon formula.\nWhile providing day-to-day transportation services, our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains. We offer a wide range of logistics services on a global basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies. We analyze customers’ transportation rate structures, modes of shipping, and carrier selection. We identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings. We suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims. We help customers minimize storage through transloading, crossdocking, drop trailer and other flow-through operations. Many of these services are provided in connection with providing the freight transportation, based on the nature of the customer relationship. Our breadth of value-added services also includes supply chain consulting and design, emissions analytics, customs brokerage and compliance, project logistics, warehousing, and cargo insurance—for which we are usually paid separately. \nWe have broadened our relationship with many of our customers by emphasizing integrated logistics solutions, resulting in our management of a greater portion of their supply chains. We often serve our customers through specially created teams and through multiple locations. Our transportation and logistics services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network. \nTransportation services accounted for approximately 95 percent of adjusted gross profits in 2024 and 2023 and 97 percent of adjusted gross profits in 2022. Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as total revenues less the total of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale. For additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n. \nThe table below shows our adjusted gross profits by transportation mode, for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nTruckload\n$\n1,072,691 \n$\n1,039,079 \n$\n1,561,310 \n$\n1,280,629 \n$\n1,071,873 \nLTL\n572,169 \n550,373 \n632,116 \n523,365 \n457,290 \nOcean\n519,970 \n420,883 \n729,839 \n711,223 \n350,094 \nAir\n135,901 \n123,470 \n198,166 \n225,286 \n151,443 \nCustoms\n107,480 \n97,096 \n107,691 \n100,539 \n87,095 \nOther Logistics Services\n225,599 \n255,735 \n251,547 \n210,958 \n195,159 \nTotal\n$\n2,633,810 \n$\n2,486,636 \n$\n3,480,669 \n$\n3,052,000 \n$\n2,312,954 \n5\nTable of Contents\nSourcing\nSince we were founded in 1905, we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities. Because of its perishable nature, produce must be rapidly packaged, carefully transported within tight timetables, usually in temperature controlled equipment, and quickly distributed to replenish high-turnover inventories maintained by our customers. In many instances, we consolidate an individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads, often to multiple destinations. Our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers.\nOur sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment, brand management, and category development services. We have various national and regional branded produce programs, including both proprietary brands and nationally licensed brands. These programs contain a wide variety of high quality, fresh bulk, and value-added fruits and vegetables. These brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers. We have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs. Sourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our adjusted gross profits in 2024 and 2023 and three percent of our adjusted gross profits in 2022.\n \nCustomer Relationships\nWe work to establish long-term relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services and people on whom they can rely. During 2024, we served 83,000 customers worldwide, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries. During 2024, our largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues. \nWe seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace, our unique information advantage, and the range of logistics services we can provide. We believe our account management disciplines, expertise, tailored solutions, and technology enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep, data-driven, understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and specific industries. \nMarkets and Resources\nCompetition\n \nThe transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete against traditional and non-traditional logistics companies, including transportation providers that own equipment, third-party freight brokers, technology matching services, internet freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, on-demand transportation service providers, NVOCCs, IACs, and freight forwarders. We also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us.\nIn our sourcing business, we compete with produce brokers, produce growers, produce marketing companies, produce wholesalers, and foodservice buying groups. We also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe often compete with respect to price, scope of services, or a combination thereof, but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are:\n•\nPeople and relationships: Our knowledgeable, dedicated, and empowered people act as an extension of our customers’ teams to innovate and execute their supply chain strategies. Our large number of unique, strong relationships provide global connections and valuable market knowledge;\n•\nGlobal suite of services: A wide and integrated selection of services and products provide our customers with consistent capacity and service levels; \n•\nScale: Our customers leverage our significant capacity, broad procurement options, global data insights, and substantial shipment volumes for better efficiency, service, and marketplace advantages; \n•\nData, products, and technology: The combination of our expertise, scale and tailored solutions gives our technology an edge. We have one of the largest datasets of shipments, routings, and carriers in the world. Generative AI is especially powerful in our hands, helping us unlock the value in our vast amount of unstructured data and create new proprietary technology that leads the industry forward. We use our data and data analysts to drive smarter solutions and products for our customers. Our proprietary Navisphere platform provides agility, flexibility, global visibility, easy integration, broad connectivity, and advanced security;\n•\nNetwork: Our combination of global capability, regional and local expertise, and scale gives our customers a strategic advantage in supply chain execution; \n•\nProcess: Proven processes and tailored solutions combine strategy with practical experience for customized action plans that succeed in the real world; and\n•\nStability: Our customers and our contract carriers rely on us to support critical elements of their business. Our financial strength, discipline, and consistent track record of success are a key foundation of our ability to sustainably meet their needs.\nProprietary Information Technology and Intellectual Property \nOur technology brings the value of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and analytics to our customers in order to help solve their most complex logistics challenges and drive the industry forward. With a\npproximately 900 data scientists, engineers, and developers, we continue to make smart, talent-focused investments globally in this critical area and continue to build the next generation of tools and processes that change how supply chains function.\nOur operations primarily use Navisphere, our global, multimodal transportation management system. It is essential for serving our customers and contract carriers and for managing our business. Most of our global network operates on Navisphere, using it to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate, and to access centralized support resources to complete all facets of a transaction. In 2024, we managed approximately 37 million shipments for 83,000 customers utilizing the more than 450,000 contract carriers on our platform. \nNavisphere and our other technology help our employees service customer orders, select the optimal mode of transportation, build and consolidate shipments, identify appropriate carriers, and manage exceptions, all based on customer-specific service parameters. Our data estate and scale provide our organization with the business intelligence to support decision-making in all areas of our business.\nNavisphere gives customers one place to purchase, manage, and track their freight transportation around the world. It allows them to communicate worldwide with parties in their supply chain across languages, currencies, and continents. Navisphere also offers sophisticated business analytics, artificial intelligence, and data-driven tools to improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands, including the following:\n•\nOur advanced visibility tools allow our customers to see their freight across all modes and services globally in a single view. Details of shipment contents, shipment status, disruptions to shipments, and resulting adjustments to estimated time of arrival using artifi\ncial intelligence are provided for the customer to manage their supply chain exceptions. Collaboration, intelligent notifications, and performance scorecards allow customers to manage their supply chain and identify inefficiencies.\n•\nNavisphere Insight™ uses data science to turn customers’ raw freight data into valuable insights, surfacing trends in transportation performance and spend that can be used for decision-making in real time or over time. Analysis is provided down to the shipment and order level.\n7\nTable of Contents\n•\nNavisphere Optimizer™ helps customers minimize the travel time, distance, and total miles of their freight, while maximizing their trailer utilization and savings. It is used during the transportation planning process and dynamically selects the right route with the right mode and right carrier on the right day.\nNavisphere is also integrated into 38 third-party transportation management systems and/or enterprise resource planning systems, allowing our dynamic pricing engine to directly deliver real-time quotes to customers when they have freight to be picked up or delivered. This eliminates the need for our customers to shop around and provides them an automated solution.\nEnhancements to our dynamic costing and pricing models allow us to react to market signals more quickly and accurately. Through a combination of more inputs, an upgraded algorithm, and greater configurability, these proprietary data science models serve to optimize our purchasing of shipping capacity and the price we offer our customers.\nWe continue to drive digital transformation in our industry. Using generative AI and large language models, we have created proprietary technology that automates steps across the lifecycle of a shipment: from giving customers a price quote, to accepting a load, to setting appointments for pickup and delivery, to checking on the load in transit. Transactions are performed in seconds, giving customers greater efficiency, speed-to-market, and cost savings while improving employee productivity, as measured by shipments per person per day.\nSome of the other industry-first tools we’ve launched include:\n•\nProcure IQ\n®\n, which uses algorithms built by our data scientists and the largest freight shipment dataset in the industry to show shippers the optimal way to purchase transportation in each of their shipping lanes;\n•\nEmissions IQ\n®\n, which gives shippers instant visibility into their carbon emissions and surfaces opportunities for reduction; and\n•\nMarket Rate IQ™, which reveals the patterns in a shipper’s spot freight that they could change to increase savings. \nNavisphere Carrier™ (\n“\nNavisphere Carrier”) provides contracted motor carriers access to the functionality necessary to efficiently manage their relationships with C.H. Robinson. Contracted motor carriers can search and book available freight, provide online status updates, keep track of receivables, and upload scanned documentation. Many of our contracted motor carriers’ favorite features of Navisphere Carrier are also available through our Navisphere Carrier mobile application for Android\n®\n and iOS\n®\n mobile operating systems. \nFreightquote\n®\n by C.H. Robinson (“Freightquote”) is a web-based, mobile-responsive offering designed to streamline the shipping process for small business customers, allowing the booking of freight without any shipping knowledge or expertise. Freightquote’s small business customers can go online with their smart phone, tablet, or computer to book their LTL or truckload freight, track shipments, get proactive notifications, and pay for transportation services with a credit card.\nWe rely on a combination of cybersecurity, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. Additionally, we have numerous registered trademarks, trade names, and logos in the United States and internationally. Our reliance on our intellectual property and proprietary technology subjects us to certain risks that, if realized, would negatively impact our operating results. For a description of such risks and their potential effect on our business, see Item 1A. of Part I, \nRisk Factors.\nRelationships with Transportation Providers\nWe continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that meet both ours and our customers’ service requirements to provide dependable services, favorable pricing, and available capacity during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply. We own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight, so these relationships are critical to our success.\nIn 2024, more than 450,000 transportation providers were on our platform, the vast majority of which are contracted motor carriers. To strengthen and maintain our relationships with contracted motor carriers, our employees regularly communicate with them and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization, reducing their empty miles, and repositioning their equipment. To make it easier for contracted motor carriers to work with us, we have a policy of making contracted motor carrier invoice payments upon receipt of proof of delivery in accordance with our standard payment terms. For those contracted motor carriers that would like a faster payment, we also offer expedited payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount, along with offering in-trip cash advances. \n8\nTable of Contents\nContracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, flatbeds, and bulk capacity. These contracted motor carriers are of all sizes, including owner-operators of a single truck, small and mid-size fleets, private fleets, and the largest national trucking companies. Consequently, we are not dependent on any one contracted motor carrier. In 2024, our largest truck transportation provider was less than one percent of our total cost of transportation, and contracted motor carriers that had fewer than 100 trucks transported approximately 73 percent of our truckload shipments. Every U.S. and Canadian motor carrier we do business with is required to execute a contract that establishes the motor carrier is acting as an independent contractor. At the time the contract is executed, and thereafter, through subscriptions with a third-party service, we confirm that each U.S. contracted motor carrier is properly licensed and insured, has the necessary federally issued authority to provide transportation services, and can provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis. Our motor carrier contracts require the contracted motor carrier issue invoices only to, and accept payment solely from, us for the shipments they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages. Our standard contracts do not include volume commitments, and typically, the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a contracted motor carrier.\nIn our NVOCC ocean transportation business, we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers, which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers. We negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers. The rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes. These contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions.\nWe operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional IAC in the United States and internationally. We select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments. We execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers, charter services, block space agreements, capacity space agreements, and transactional spot market negotiations. Through charter services, we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements. Our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period. The contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year. The transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results have been subject to seasonal trends as a result of, or as influenced by, numerous factors, including national holidays, weather patterns, consumer demand, economic conditions, and other similar and subtle forces. Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations, we expect this trend to continue, and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future. \nGovernment Regulation\nOur operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local transportation agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate. \nWe are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. C.H. Robinson is also licensed under, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) as an ocean transportation intermediary in the capacity as both a freight forwarder and NVOCC; we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. We operate as a U.S. Department of Homeland Security certified IAC, providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”).       C.H. Robinson performs customs brokerage services pursuant to its customs brokerage license issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”). As a licensed customs broker, C.H. Robinson has experience working with other government agencies that maintain jurisdiction over certain customs entries. We also hold customs trade partnership against terrorism      (“CTPAT”) certification with CBP as both a customs broker and NVOCC. \nAlthough Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight, some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing, registration, or permit requirements. We contractually require and rely on the motor carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements. We, along with the contracted motor carriers on which we rely to arrange transportation services for our customers, are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations. Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past, there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future. Violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines, as well as increased claims liability.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) as required by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (“PACA”). Other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations. \nAs a publicly traded company and issuer of stock, we are subject to and maintain compliance with various anti-corruption and anti-bribery statutes such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the UK Bribery Act 2010, and certain other foreign countries’ equivalent statutes or programs in the countries in which we operate. \nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries concerning the handling of personal information, including laws that require us to notify governmental authorities and/or affected individuals of data breaches involving certain personal information. These laws and regulations include, for example, the European General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Regulatory actions or litigation seeking to impose significant penalties could be brought against us in the event of a data breach or alleged non-compliance with such laws and regulations.\nHuman Capital\nAt C.H. Robinson, our employees connect the world and are the foundation of our success, creating value for our customers and contract carriers. They are supply chain experts and problem solvers who are committed to winning, and act as an extension of our customers’ teams. Our customers and contract carriers consistently cite our people as the number one reason for choosing C.H.

This framework emphasizes delivering exceptional service and high value through our expertise, scale and tailored solutions. We believe The Robinson Way offers a clear understanding for employees on how their roles contribute to the company’s success and provides a sense of purpose and direction. It emphasizes forging lasting relationships with integrity, honesty, and respect; committing to getting the job done right; owning successes and failures and learning from both; challenging the status quo; and working together to raise the bar. This framework not only aligns employees with the company’s strategic goals but also creates a high-performance culture of engagement, recognition, and continuous improvement, ultimately enhancing career growth and job satisfaction.\nWe attract, retain, and reward exceptional talent through our performance culture, which is grounded in our purpose, and a commitment to their career development and growth. As a service company, we know that to succeed and win in the market we need to provide a workplace environment where our people believe they are empowered to succeed, can grow and learn, and are proud to work.\nWe are a global company with a large and varied customer and contract carrier base. We work with 83,000 customers across a wide variety of industries, with 450,000 contract carriers on our platform. As of December 31, 2024, we had a total of 13,781 employees in 38 countries. Our employees speak 70 languages and encompass four generations in the workplace.

This leads to better solutions for our customers, contract carriers, and growers; drives our competitive advantage in recruiting and retaining top talent; and enhances our high-performance culture.\nOversight and Governance\nOur Board of Directors and Talent and Compensation Committee oversee our human capital management efforts. They receive regular updates from our Chief Human Resources and Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Officer on key strategic initiatives, success measurements, and other relevant matters including hiring, retention, culture, employee engagement, succession planning, leadership, compensation, and benefits.\nOur People\nWe lead the industry with a strong performance-driven team.

Robinson,” “the company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is one of the largest global logistics providers in the world, with consolidated total revenues of $17.7 billion in 2024. We deliver logistics like no one else. Companies around the world look to us to reimagine supply chains, advance freight technology, and solve logistics \nchallenges\n—\nfrom the simple to the complex. We are grounded in our\n \npromise to deliver exceptional customer success, using our expertise, scale, and tailored solutions to help customers navigate increasingly complex global supply chains.\nOur adjusted gross profits and adjusted gross profit margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted gross profits is calculated as gross profits excluding amortization of internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. Adjusted gross profit margin is calculated as adjusted gross profits divided by total revenues. We believe adjusted gross profits and adjusted gross profit margin are useful measures of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider adjusted gross profits to be a primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations often focuses on the changes in our adjusted gross profits and adjusted gross profit margin.

These conditions are typically referred to as a soft market and resulted in transportation rates at, or near, the estimated cost to operate a truck for much of 2024. Although carrier capacity has begun exiting the market, it has been at rates much slower than is typically seen at this stage of the market cycle. One of the key metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our Managed Solutions business. Routing guide depth represents the average number of carriers contacted prior to acceptance when procuring a transportation provider. Average routing guide depth has remained low throughout 2024 and finished the year at 1.3, representing that on average, the first carrier in a shipper’s routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases. Average routing guide depth at the end of 2023 was 1.2 and held at that level before increasing slightly at the end of 2024. \nThe global forwarding market experienced significant volatility in 2024, impacted by re-routing, extended transit times, and improving demand. Most carriers avoided the Suez Canal for the majority of 2024 due to the Red Sea conflict, which increased transit times, straining global carrier capacity. Consequently, ocean freight rates have remained elevated compared to the prior year. Uncertainty remains on how the Red Sea conflict, along with geopolitical factors and new capacity entering the market, will impact the global forwarding market in 2025. The global air freight market has largely stabilized, although air freight costs remain elevated compared to the prior year. The elevated ecommerce export demand from Asia during much of 2024 resulted in the repositioning of air freight capacity to that trade lane, causing freighter capacity shortages in other trade lanes and driving up pricing in the market in certain trade lanes. \nBUSINESS TRENDS\nOur 2024 surface transportation results were largely consistent with the trends discussed in the market trends section and similar to trends experienced in the prior year. The weak freight demand and excess carrier capacity in the market resulted in most shipments moving under committed pricing agreements and suppressed freight rates on the limited number of shipments reaching the spot market for most of 2024. Despite these challenging market conditions, we were able to improve our adjusted gross profit per transaction in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts leading to better adjusted gross profits per transaction within our transactional portfolio. Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 5.5 percent during 2024. Our average truckload linehaul rate charged to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 5.0 percent during 2024.\nOur 2024 Global Forwarding results were largely consistent with the trends discussed above in the market trends section. We experienced elevated purchased transportation costs in 2024 compared to the prior year, resulting in increased total revenues and cost of purchased transportation in ocean services. In 2024, the global forwarding market faced disruptions that led to a significant rise in freight rates. This contrasts with 2023, which saw weak demand and elevated levels of capacity. These market dynamics resulted in a notable increase in both total revenues and cost of purchased transportation compared to the previous year. Our total ocean freight volumes increased 5.5 percent while our air freight tonnage increased 17.0 percent in 2024 compared to the prior year. \nSELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS\nThe following summarizes select 2024 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2023:\n•\nTotal revenues increased 0.7 percent to $17.7 billion, primarily driven by higher pricing and volume in our ocean services, partially offset by lower pricing and volume in our truckload services.\n•\nGross profits increased 5.8 percent to $2.7 billion. Adjusted gross profits increased 6.2 percent to $2.8 billion, primarily driven by higher adjusted gross profit per transaction in our truckload and ocean services.\n•\nPersonnel expenses decreased 0.6 percent to $1.5 billion, primarily due to cost optimization efforts and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher variable compensation and higher restructuring charges related to workforce reductions. Average employee headcount decreased 10.3 percent.\n•\nOther selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 2.5 percent to $639.6 million, primarily due to a $44.5 million loss on the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. The prior year included \n27\nTable of Contents\n$19.6 million of charges, primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in Argentina. In addition, other SG&A expenses decreased across several expense categories in the current year.\n•\nIncome from operations totaled $669.1 million, up 30.0 percent from last year, due to an increase in adjusted gross profits, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin of 24.2 percent increased 440 basis points.\n•\nInterest and other income/expenses, net totaled $89.9 million, which primarily consisted of $85.9 million of interest expense, which decreased $4.3 million versus last year due to a lower average debt balance. The current year results also included a $7.4 million net loss from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses.\n•\nThe effective tax rate for 2024 was 19.6 percent compared to 20.5 percent in 2023. The lower rate in the current year was driven by the impact of non-recurring discrete items and higher U.S. tax credits, partially offset by higher pre-tax income and lower foreign tax credits.\n•\nNet income totaled $465.7 million, up 43.2 percent from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 41.9 percent to $3.86.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% change\n2022\n% change\nRevenues:\nTransportation\n$\n16,353,745 \n$\n16,372,660 \n(0.1)\n%\n$\n23,516,384 \n(30.4)\n%\nSourcing\n1,371,211 \n1,223,783 \n12.0 \n%\n1,180,241 \n3.7 \n%\nTotal revenues\n \n17,724,956 \n17,596,443 \n0.7 \n%\n24,696,625 \n(28.7)\n%\nCosts and expenses:\nPurchased transportation and related services\n$\n13,719,935 \n$\n13,886,024 \n(1.2)\n%\n$\n20,035,715 \n(30.7)\n%\nPurchased products sourced for resale\n1,240,007 \n1,105,811 \n12.1 \n%\n1,067,733 \n3.6 \n%\nPersonnel expenses\n1,456,249 \n1,465,735 \n(0.6)\n%\n1,722,980 \n(14.9)\n%\nOther selling, general, and administrative expenses\n639,624 \n624,266 \n2.5 \n%\n603,415 \n3.5 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n \n17,055,815 \n17,081,836 \n(0.2)\n%\n23,429,843 \n(27.1)\n%\nIncome from operations\n \n669,141 \n514,607 \n30.0 \n%\n1,266,782 \n(59.4)\n%\nInterest and other expense\n(89,937)\n(105,421)\n(14.7)\n%\n(100,017)\n5.4 \n%\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n \n579,204 \n409,186 \n41.6 \n%\n1,166,765 \n(64.9)\n%\nProvision for income taxes\n113,514 \n84,057 \n35.0 \n%\n226,241 \n(62.8)\n%\nNet income\n \n$\n465,690 \n$\n325,129 \n43.2 \n%\n$\n940,524 \n(65.4)\n%\nDiluted net income per share\n \n$\n3.86 \n$\n2.72 \n41.9 \n%\n$\n7.40 \n(63.2)\n%\nAverage employee headcount\n \n14,386 \n16,041 \n(10.3)\n%\n17,601 \n(8.9)\n%\nAdjusted gross profit margin percentage\n(1)\nTransportation\n16.1%\n15.2%\n90 bps\n14.8%\n40 bps\nSourcing\n9.6%\n9.6%\n— bps\n9.5%\n10 bps\nTotal adjusted gross profit margin\n15.6%\n14.8%\n80 bps\n14.5%\n30 bps\n________________________________ \n(1)\n Adjusted gross profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure explained above. \nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources includes a comparison of the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, to the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. A similar discussion and analysis that compares the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, can be \n28\nTable of Contents\nfound in Item 7, “\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\n” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024. \nA reconciliation of our reportable segments to our consolidated results can be found in Note 8, \nSegment Reporting, \nin Part II, Financial Information of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations—Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nTotal revenues and direct costs.\n Total revenues and direct costs were essentially flat with the prior year with significant offsetting impacts from ocean and truckload services. Ocean transportation revenues and direct costs increased, driven by the volatile market conditions experienced in 2024, as discussed in the market trends section above, which significantly impacted carrier capacity and led to increased ocean freight rates. Conversely, truckload transportation revenues and direct costs decreased compared to the prior year. This decline in truckload pricing and purchased transportation costs was driven by the soft market conditions in surface transportation, characterized by an oversupply of carrier capacity throughout most of 2024. Our sourcing total revenue and direct costs increased, driven by higher average pricing with retail customers and increased case volume with foodservice customers.\nGross profits and adjusted gross profits.\n Our transportation adjusted gross profits increased due to higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in ocean and truckload services, in addition to increased volumes in our ocean service line. The higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in ocean services were driven by the challenges facing the global forwarding market, which resulted in elevated pricing. In truckload services, the increase was driven by the improved execution and disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts from our team within our transactional portfolio during 2024. Sourcing adjusted gross profits increased, driven by an increase in integrated supply chain solutions for retail and foodservice customers.\nOperating expenses.\n Personnel expenses decreased, primarily due to cost optimization efforts including lower average employee headcount partially offset by higher variable compensation reflecting the improved results compared to the prior year. Other SG&A expenses increased primarily due to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business, which was partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of our Argentina operations in 2023 discussed below.  \nIn addition to the above, our personnel expenses for 2024 included $24.1 million of severance and related personnel expenses related to our 2024 Restructuring Program. We also incurred $66.2 million in other SG&A expenses in 2024. These expenses were primarily due to a $44.5 million loss related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and $21.9 million related to our 2024 Restructuring Program. \nOur personnel expenses for 2023 included $18.4 million of severance and related expenses related to our 2022 Restructuring Program. We also incurred $19.6 million of other SG&A expenses primarily related to the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Refer to Note 14, \nRestructuring\n, for further discussion related to our 2024 and 2022 Restructuring Programs. Refer to Note 15, \nDivestitures\n, for further discussion related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and Argentina operations.\nInterest and other income/expense, net.\n Interest and other income/expense, net was $89.9 million, primarily consisted of $85.9 million of interest expense, which decreased $4.3 million compared to the prior year due to a lower average debt balance. The current year also included a $7.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses. The prior year included a $24.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses driven by a $16.4 million foreign currency loss related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso.\nProvision for income taxes.\n Our effective income tax rate was 19.6 percent in 2024 and 20.5 percent in 2023. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of U.S. tax credits and incentives and share-based payment awards, which reduced the effective tax rate by 5.3 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by foreign tax credits and state income taxes, net of federal benefit, which increased the effective tax rate by 2.5 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign tax credits, U.S. tax credits and incentives, and the tax impact of share-based payment awards, which reduced the effective tax rate by 9.5 percentage points, 3.4 percentage points, and 2.7 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by a higher tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of a Section 199 domestic production activities settlement, which increased the effective tax rate by 5.8 percentage points and 4.7 percentage points, respectively.\n29\nTable of Contents\nNAST Segment Results of Operations\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n% change\n2022\n% change\nTotal revenues\n$\n11,727,539 \n$\n12,471,075 \n(6.0)\n%\n$\n15,827,467 \n(21.2)\n%\nCosts and expenses:\nPurchased transportation and related services\n10,086,344 \n10,877,221 \n(7.3)\n%\n13,630,763 \n(20.2)\n%\nPersonnel expenses\n669,611 \n662,037 \n1.1 \n%\n844,472 \n(21.6)\n%\nOther selling, general, and administrative expenses\n440,292 \n471,857 \n(6.7)\n%\n518,930 \n(9.1)\n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n \n11,196,247 \n12,011,115 \n(6.8)\n%\n14,994,165 \n(19.9)\n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n531,292 \n$\n459,960 \n15.5 \n%\n$\n833,302 \n(44.8)\n%\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% change\n2022\n% change\nAverage employee headcount\n \n5,696 \n6,469 \n(11.9)\n%\n7,365 \n(12.2)\n%\nService line volume statistics\nTruckload\n(2.5)\n%\n(4.5)\n%\nLTL\n2.5 \n%\n(2.0)\n%\nAdjusted gross profits\n(1)\nTruckload\n$\n994,722 \n$\n943,674 \n5.4 \n%\n$\n1,463,363 \n(35.5)\n%\nLTL\n565,892 \n543,657 \n4.1 \n%\n626,744 \n(13.3)\n%\nOther \n80,581 \n106,523 \n(24.4)\n%\n106,597 \n(0.1)\n%\nTotal adjusted gross profits\n$\n1,641,195 \n$\n1,593,854 \n3.0 \n%\n$\n2,196,704 \n(27.4)\n%\n________________________________ \n(1)\n Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained above. \nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nTotal revenues and direct costs.\n NAST total revenues and direct costs decreased, driven by lower pricing and purchased transportation costs and a decline in volume in truckload services. The lower pricing and purchased transportation costs in truckload services were driven by the soft market conditions experienced throughout 2024 as the market remained in a prolonged stage of oversupplied carrier capacity. These declines were partially offset by increased revenues and direct costs in LTL services driven by increased volumes.\nGross profits and adjusted gross profits. \nNAST adjusted gross profits increased, driven by truckload services due to higher adjusted gross profits per transaction partially offset by a decline in truckload service volumes. This improvement was driven by improved execution and disciplined pricing and capacity procurement within our transactional portfolio in 2024. Our average truckload linehaul rate per mile charged to our customers, which excludes fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 5.0 percent. Our truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 5.5 percent. Additionally, LTL services adjusted gross profits per transaction increased, driven by the improved execution and disciplined pricing efforts across our portfolio, in addition to an increase in volumes. NAST other adjusted gross profits decreased, primarily due to a decline in warehousing and intermodal adjusted gross profits.\nOperating expenses.\n NAST personnel expenses increased, driven by an increase in variable compensation reflecting the improved results compared to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount in addition to lower allocated corporate expenses.\nIn addition to the above, NAST personnel expenses for 2024 included $10.2 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred $6.9 million in other SG&A expenses in 2024. These expenses were both associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. Personnel expenses for 2023 included $1.1 million of severance and related personnel expenses associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program. Refer to Note 14, \nRestructuring,\n for further discussion related to our 2024 and 2022 Restructuring Programs.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe operating expenses of NAST and all other segments include allocated corporate expenses. Allocated personnel expenses consist primarily of stock-based compensation allocated based upon segment participation levels in our equity plans. Remaining corporate allocations, including corporate functions and technology related expenses, are primarily included within each segment’s other SG&A expenses and allocated based upon relevant segment operating metrics.\nGlobal Forwarding Segment Results of Operations\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n% change\n2022\n% change\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,805,018 \n$\n2,997,704 \n26.9 \n%\n$\n6,812,008 \n(56.0)\n%\nCosts and expenses:\nPurchased transportation and related services\n3,002,469 \n2,308,339 \n30.1 \n%\n5,728,535 \n(59.7)\n%\nPersonnel expenses\n371,576 \n366,464 \n1.4 \n%\n414,690 \n(11.6)\n%\nOther selling, general, and administrative expenses\n218,497 \n237,071 \n(7.8)\n%\n219,419 \n8.0 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n \n3,592,542 \n2,911,874 \n23.4 \n%\n6,362,644 \n(54.2)\n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n212,476 \n$\n85,830 \n147.6 \n%\n$\n449,364 \n(80.9)\n%\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% change\n2022\n% change\nAverage employee headcount\n \n4,678\n5,222\n(10.4)\n%\n5,712\n(8.6)\n%\nService line volume statistics\nOcean\n5.5 \n%\n(5.0)\n%\nAir\n17.0 \n%\n(6.5)\n%\nCustoms\n4.5 \n%\n(8.5)\n%\nAdjusted gross profits\n(1)\nOcean\n$\n519,878 \n$\n420,826 \n23.5 \n%\n$\n729,453 \n(42.3)\n%\nAir\n134,289 \n121,978 \n10.1 \n%\n195,191 \n(37.5)\n%\nCustoms\n107,485 \n97,095 \n10.7 \n%\n107,691 \n(9.8)\n%\nOther \n40,897 \n49,466 \n(17.3)\n%\n51,138 \n(3.3)\n%\nTotal adjusted gross profits\n$\n802,549 \n$\n689,365 \n16.4 \n%\n$\n1,083,473 \n(36.4)\n%\n________________________________ \n(1)\nAdjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained above. \nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nTotal revenues and direct costs. \nGlobal Forwarding total revenues and direct costs increased, driven by higher pricing and purchased transportation costs in ocean services in addition to volume increases across all global forwarding transportation services. The higher pricing and purchased transportation costs in ocean services were driven by the volatile market conditions in 2024 discussed in the market trends section above, which significantly impacted carrier capacity and led to increased ocean freight rates in 2024. Additionally, disruptions in the ocean freight market resulted in increased air freight tonnage in 2024, driven by ocean freight conversions in many trade lanes. These ocean freight conversions, coupled with heightened ecommerce demand out of North Asia and stronger peak season volumes compared to 2023, elevated air freight costs in certain trade lanes in 2024. The volatile market conditions in 2024 contrasted with the weak demand, elevated capacity, and suppressed freight rates experienced in 2023.\nGross profits and adjusted gross profits.\n Global Forwarding adjusted gross profits increased, driven by higher adjusted gross profits per shipment and an increase in volumes in ocean services driven by the challenges facing the global forwarding market, which resulted in elevated pricing. This compared to a market characterized by weak freight demand and excess carrier capacity in 2023. Air freight adjusted gross profits increased due an increase in metric tons shipped which was partially offset by lower adjusted gross profits per metric ton shipped. The decrease in adjusted gross profits per metric ton shipped, was driven by sharp increases to the cost of air freight in certain trade lanes during 2024 compared to 2023. Customs adjusted gross profits increased, driven by higher transaction volumes and an increase in adjusted gross profits per transaction.\n31\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses.\n Personnel expenses increased primarily due to increased variable compensation reflecting the improved results relative to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount. Other SG&A expenses decreased, as the prior year included an $18.0 million loss related to the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Additionally, other SG&A expenses declined in the current year related to lower allocated corporate expenses and lower amortization expenses following the completion of amortization of intangible assets from a prior acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses as the prior year benefited from a reduction to the allowance for credit losses.\nIn addition to the above, personnel expenses for 2024 included $6.9 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred $4.7 million in other SG&A expenses in 2024. These expenses were both associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. Personnel expenses for 2023 included $3.8 million of severance and related personnel expenses. Other SG&A in 2023 included $18.2 million primarily related to disposal and exit activities, including asset impairments. These expenses were associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program and the divestiture of our Argentina operations.

This increase was partially offset by a decline in European truckload pricing and volume in our Other Surface Transportation business resulting in a decline in total revenues and direct costs.\nGross profits and adjusted gross profits.\n Robinson Fresh adjusted gross profits increased due to an increase in integrated supply chain solutions for retail and foodservice customers. Managed Solutions adjusted gross profits decreased due to lower transaction volume. Other Surface Transportation adjusted gross profits decreased primarily due to a decrease in adjusted gross profits per transaction in European truckload and a decrease in European truckload volumes.\nOperating expenses.\n Personnel expenses in 2024, for All Other and Corporate included $7.0 million of severance and related personnel expenses primarily associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. We also incurred $54.5 million of other SG&A expenses in 2024, that included a $44.5 million loss related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. Personnel expenses in 2023, included $13.5 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred $1.5 million of other SG&A expenses in 2023. These expenses were associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program and the divestiture of our Argentina operations.

Cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States totaled $134.0 million as of December 31, 2024, and $142.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Working capital decreased from $828.7 million at December 31, 2023, to $644.7 million at December 31, 2024.\nWe prioritize our investments to grow our market share and expand globally in key industries, trade lanes, and geographies, and to digitize our customer, carrier, and internal tools to support our organic growth. We are continually looking for acquisitions, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities.\nThe following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents (dollars in thousands):\nTwelve months ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n% change\n2022\n% change\nSources (uses) of cash:\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n509,084 \n$\n731,946 \n(30.4)\n%\n$\n1,650,171 \n(55.6)\n%\nCapital expenditures\n(74,288)\n(84,111)\n(128,497)\nSale of property and equipment\n— \n1,324 \n63,579 \nCash used for investing activities\n(74,288)\n(82,787)\n(10.3)\n%\n(64,918)\n27.5 \n%\nRepurchase of common stock\n— \n(63,884)\n(1,459,900)\nCash dividends\n(294,772)\n(291,569)\n(285,317)\nNet (repayments) borrowings on debt\n(204,000)\n(394,000)\n54,000 \nOther financing activities\n82,673 \n31,620 \n71,671 \nNet cash used for financing activities\n(416,099)\n(717,833)\n(42.0)\n%\n(1,619,546)\n(55.7)\n%\nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(8,152)\n(3,284)\n(5,638)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents, including cash and cash equivalents classified within assets held for sale\n$\n10,545 \n$\n(71,958)\n$\n(39,931)\n33\nTable of Contents\nCash flow from operating activities.\n We generated significant cash flow from operating activities in 2024, driven by our strong operating results and increased net income. The increase to net income was offset by elevated freight rates in ocean services, driven by the factors discussed in the market trends and business trends sections above, which resulted in an increase in net operating working capital and negatively impacted our cash flow from operations. In 2023, our results were adversely impacted by weak freight demand and excess carrier capacity, which significantly decreased our net operating working capital and benefited our cash flow from operations. We continue to closely monitor credit and collections activities and the quality of our accounts receivable balance to minimize risk as well as work with our customers to facilitate the movement of goods across their supply chains while also ensuring timely payment.\nCash used for investing activities.\n Our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. Capital expenditures consisted primarily of investments in software, which are intended to deliver scalable solutions by transforming our processes, accelerating the pace of development, prioritizing data integrity, improving our customer and carrier experience, and increasing our efficiency to help expand our adjusted operating margins and grow the business. \nDuring 2022, we sold an office building in Kansas City, Missouri, for a sales price of $55.0 million and recognized a gain of $23.5 million on the sale. We simultaneously entered into an agreement to lease the office building for 10 years.\nWe anticipate capital expenditures in 2025 to be approximately $75 million to $85 million. \nCash used for financing activities.\n We had net repayments on debt in 2024 and 2023 and net borrowings on debt in \n2022\n. Net repayments in 2024 were primarily to decrease the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Securitization Facility. Net repayments in 2023 were primarily to repay the Senior Notes Series A, which matured in August 2023, and the 364-Day Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which matured in May 2023. \nNet borrowings in 2022 were primarily to fund share repurchases and working capital needs in the first half of 2022. \nThe decrease in cash used for share repurchases was due to a significant decrease in the number of shares repurchased in \n2023 compared to \n2022\n as minimal shares were repurchased in the second half of 2023. No shares were repurchased in 2024.\nIn December 2022, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 20,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2024, there were 6,763,445 shares remaining for future repurchases. The number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, other potential uses of our cash, and market conditions. Over the long term, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend and share repurchases to enhance shareholder value. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. We may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding Senior Notes through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise.\nWe believe that, assuming no change in our current business plan, our available cash, together with expected future cash generated from operations, the amount available under our credit facilities, and credit available in the market, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. We also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice, if needed.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. \nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We consider the following items in our consolidated financial statements to require significant estimation or judgment. \nREVENUE RECOGNITION. \nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify our performance obligations to provide distinct goods and services to our customers. Our transportation and logistics service arrangements often require management to use judgment and make estimates that impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition. \n34\nTable of Contents\nTransportation and Logistics Services. \nAs a global logistics provider, our primary performance obligation under our customer contracts is to utilize our relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies to efficiently and cost-effectively transport our customers’ freight. Revenue is recognized for these performance obligations as they are satisfied over the contract term, which generally represents the transit period. The transit period can vary based upon the method of transport; generally, a number of days for over the road, rail, and air transportation, or several weeks in the case of an ocean shipment. \nRecognizing revenue for contracts where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end requires management to make judgments that affect the amounts and timing of revenue recognized at period end. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded revenue of $200.3 million for services we have provided while a shipment was still in-transit, but for which we had not yet completed our performance obligation or had not yet invoiced our customer compared to $189.9 million at December 31, 2023. The amount of revenue recognized for contracts where the transit period was partially complete increased as of December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, driven by the macroeconomic and industry factors impacting the cost of purchased transportation in ocean services. See Item 7 of Part II, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, for further information. \nWe utilize our historical knowledge of shipping lanes and estimated transit times to determine the transit period in cases where our customers’ freight has not reached its intended destination. In addition, we analyze contract data for the first few days following the reporting date combined with our historical experience of trends related to partially completed contracts as of the reporting date to determine our right to consideration for the services we have provided where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end. Differences in contract data for the first few days following the reporting date compared with our historical experience or disruptions such as weather events, port congestion, or other delays could cause the actual amount of revenue earned at period end to differ from these estimates.\nTotal revenues represent the total dollar value of revenue recognized from contracts with customers for the goods and services we provide. Substantially all of our revenue is attributable to contracts with our customers. Most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the services we provide and goods we sell. In these transactions, we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to our customer and we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. Additionally, in our sourcing business, in some cases we take inventory risk before the specified good has been transferred to our customer. \nCustoms brokerage, managed solutions, freight forwarding, and sourcing managed procurement transactions are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present. See also Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, for further information regarding our revenue recognition policies. \nGOODWILL.\n Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually on November 30, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Typically, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value (“Step Zero Analysis”). If the Step Zero Analysis indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value, an additional impairment assessment is performed (“Step One Analysis”).\nWhen we perform a Step One Analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \nIn the Step One Analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using either a discounted cash flow analysis, the market approach, or a combination of both. Projecting discounted future cash flows requires the use of significant judgement to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and the appropriate discount rate. Use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are similar in size and industry. Actual results may differ from those used in our valuations when a Step One Analysis is performed. \nOn July 27, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our Europe Surface Transportation business. The sale included the assets and liabilities of the Europe Surface Transportation business other than its proprietary technology platform (the “disposal group”). As a result of the divestiture, the Europe Surface Transportation disposal group was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024. We have tested the goodwill of the Europe Surface Transportation reporting unit as of December 31, 2024, by performing Step One Analysis, before measuring the fair value of the disposal group to be presented as held for sale. We determined that the $28.6 million goodwill balance was not impaired.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur Europe Surface Transportation Step One Analysis was completed using a combination of the market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis. The market approach was completed to determine the fair value of the Europe Surface Transportation business, excluding its proprietary technology platform, and was equal to the agreed-upon sale price of the business. As the sale does not include a technology platform necessary to run the business, a discounted cash flow analysis was completed to determine the fair value of the Europe Surface Transportation proprietary technology platform. The computed fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. As noted in Note 15, \nDivestitures\n, the sale of the Europe Surface Transportation disposal group was completed in February 2025.\nAs part of our annual Step Zero Analysis performed in 2024 for all other reporting units, there were no factors identified suggesting that it was more likely than not that the fair value was less than their respective carrying value. As such, a Step One Analysis was not completed for any other reporting units and no impairments have been recorded in any period presented in the financial statements.  \nINCOME TAX RESERVES. \nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged, and we may or may not prevail in full or in part. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine a tax position, more likely than not, will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We presume all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nWe regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is (i) a completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue, (iii) litigation of the issue, including appeals, (iv) a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (v) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for income tax reserves. Although we believe we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. Uncertain income tax positions are included in “Accrued income taxes” or “Noncurrent income taxes payable” in the consolidated balance sheets.\nDISCLOSURES ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL CONTINGENCIES\nThe following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations, due by period, which affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nBorrowings under credit agreements\n$\n456,000 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n456,000 \nSenior notes\n(1)\n25,200 \n25,200 \n25,200 \n607,350 \n— \n— \n682,950 \nLong-term notes payable\n(1)\n14,440 \n14,440 \n14,440 \n164,440 \n8,050 \n207,200 \n423,010 \nMaturity of lease liabilities\n(2)\n89,523 \n88,899 \n71,829 \n54,842 \n42,035 \n73,985 \n421,113 \nPurchase obligations\n(3)\n76,604 \n36,751 \n21,319 \n19,727 \n21,538 \n— \n175,939 \nTotal\n$\n661,767 \n$\n165,290 \n$\n132,788 \n$\n846,359 \n$\n71,623 \n$\n281,185 \n$\n2,159,012 \n________________________________ \n(1)\nAmounts payable relate to the semi-annual interest due on the senior and long-term notes and the principal amount at maturity. \n(2) \nWe maintain operating leases for office space, warehouses, office equipment, and trailers. See Note 10, \nLeases\n, for further information.\n(3) \nPurchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. As of December 31, 2024, such obligations primarily include ocean and air freight capacity, telecommunications services, third-party software contracts, maintenance contracts, and information technology related capacity. In some instances, our contractual commitments may be usage based or require estimates as to the timing of cash settlement.\nWe have no financing lease obligations. Long-term liabilities consist primarily of noncurrent taxes payable and long-term notes payable. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the amounts or timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $23.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 5, \nIncome Taxes\n, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes. As of December 31, 2024, we do not have significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n36\nTable of Contents",
