It may also be helpful to refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2025, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on May 29, 2025, including information in Item 1, \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" and Part II, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" of this Quarterly Report, for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn the MD&A, we analyze and explain the period-over-period changes in the specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This information, discussion, and analysis may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in STERIS.\nFinancial Measures\nIn the following sections of the MD&A, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). We sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. We define these financial measures as follows:\n•\nBacklog\n – We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. We use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.\n•\nDebt-to-total capital\n – We define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity. We use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.\n•\nDays sales outstanding (“DSO”)\n – We define DSO as the average collection period for accounts receivable. It is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters’ revenues, multiplied by 365 days. We use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.\nWe, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. We have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. These financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies, and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. Additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure, is available in the subsection of MD&A titled, \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nRevenues – Defined\nAs required by Regulation S-X, we separately present revenues generated as either Product revenues or Service revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income for each period presented. When we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the Regulation S-X requirements. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenues:\n•\nRevenues\n – Our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.\n•\nProduct Revenues\n – We define Product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.\n31\nTable of Contents\n•\nService Revenues\n – We define Service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. Service revenues also include outsourced reprocessing services and instrument and scope repairs, as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our Applied Sterilization Technologies (\"AST\") segment.\n•\nCapital Equipment Revenues\n – We define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes steam and gas sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, automated endoscope reprocessors, pure steam/water systems, surgical lights and tables, and integrated operating rooms (\"OR\").\n•\nConsumable Revenues \n– We define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes dedicated consumables used in our capital equipment, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, instruments and tools, sterility assurance products, barrier protection solutions, and cleaning consumables.\n•\nRecurring Revenues \n– We define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and Service revenues.\nGeneral Company Overview and Executive Summary \nSTERIS is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention.  WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare and life science products and services around the globe. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative products and services. These include: consumable products, such as detergents, endoscopy accessories, barrier products, instruments and tools; services, including equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing, and outsourced reprocessing; capital equipment, such as sterilizers, surgical tables, and automated endoscope reprocessors; and connectivity solutions such as OR integrati\non.\nWe operate and report our financial information in three reportable business segments: Healthcare, AST, and Life Sciences.\n \nPreviously, we had four reportable business segments; however, as a result of the divestiture of our Dental segment, Dental is presented as discontinued operations. Historical information has been retrospectively adjusted to exclude discontinued operations for comparability, as required. For more information, refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Discontinued Operations.\" Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. We describe our business segments in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Business Segment Information.\"\nThe\n bulk of our revenues are derived from healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical Customers. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. \nIn\n addition, there is increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all of which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n. \nDuring the first \nsix months of fiscal 2026, we completed a tuck-in acquisition which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the Healthcare segment. Total aggregate consideration was approximately $15.0 million.\nDuring the first \nsix months of fiscal 2025, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions, which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the Healthcare and AST segments. Total aggregate consideration was approximately \n$17.5 million.\nAcquisition and integration expenses totaled \n$1.3 million\n and \n$1.8 million\n for the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Acquisition and integration expenses totaled \n$3.2 million\n and \n$5.5 million\n for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Acquisition and integration expenses are reported in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of our Consolidated Statements of Income and include, but are not limited to, investment banker, advisory, legal and other professional fees, and certain employee-related expenses.\nOn April 1, 2024, we completed the sale of the Controlled Environment Certification Services (\"CECS\") business. We recorded net proceeds of \n$41.9 million\n and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of \n$19.2 million \nin the first three months of fiscal 2025.\nFor more information regarding our recent acquisitions, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n.\"\nDiscontinued Operations\n. On April 11, 2024, the Company announced its plan to sell substantially all of the net assets of its Dental segment for total cash consideration of \n$787.5 million\n, subject to customary adjustments, and up to an additional \n32\nTable of Contents\n$12.5 million\n in contingent payment had the Dental business achieved certain revenue targets in fiscal 2025. No amounts have been recorded with respect to this contingent consideration. The transaction was structured as an equity sale and closed on May 31, 2024. \nA component of an entity is reported in discontinued operations after meeting the criteria for held for sale classification if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results. We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the divestiture of our Dental segment and determined that those conditions for discontinued operations presentation had been met prior to \nMarch 31, 2024. The Dental segment results of operations have been reclassified as income (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include the financial results of the Dental segment through the date of sale on May 31, 2024. A majority of the proceeds received from the sale were utilized to pay off existing debt.\nFor more information, see \nNote 4\n to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"\nDiscontinued Operations\n.\"\nU.S. Tax Reform\n. On July 4, 2025, the U.S. enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\") which contains substantial changes to its tax policies. Business provisions in the OBBBA, some of which were extensions of those established in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, include favorable cost recovery allowances, changes to U.S. international tax rules, and changes to energy and environmental related incentives. The law has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions applicable to years beginning after fiscal 2026. The law did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the three and six month periods ending September 30, 2025, and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nHighlights. \nRevenues increased 9.9% to $1,460.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $1,328.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Revenues increased 9.3% to $2,851.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $2,608.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase during the three and six month periods reflects the benefits of higher volume and pricing, with all three segments contributing to growth.\nGross profit percentage for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 was 44.2% compared to the gross profit percentage for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 of 43.6%. Gross profit percentage for the first six months of fiscal 2026 was 44.7% compared to the gross profit percentage for the first six months of fiscal 2025 of 44.1%. The increase in gross profit percentage for the three and six month periods reflects favorable impacts from pricing, productivity, mix, and other cost reductions that were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from inflation, and tariff costs.\nIncome from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 was $265.8 million, compared to income from operations of $219.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2026 was $511.8 million, compared to income from operations of $405.2 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025. The increase in income from operations for the three and six month periods is primarily due to increased volume and pricing, which was partially offset by inflation and tariff costs. Additionally, income from operations during the first six months of fiscal 2026 reflected the benefit of lower restructuring expenses.\nCash flows from operations were $707.8 million and free cash flow was $527.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2026 compared to cash flows from operations of $554.5 million and free cash flow of $344.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 (see the subsection below titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information and related reconciliation of cash flows from operations to free cash flow). The fiscal 2026 increase in cash flows from operations and free cash flow resulted from an increase in earnings and from the increase in cash provided by working capital improvements. Free cash flow was also impacted by a decrease in capital expenditures when compared to the same prior year period.\nOur debt-to-total capital ratio was 21.3% at September 30, 2025 and 23.6% at March 31, 2025. During the first six months of fiscal 2026, we declared and paid cash dividends totaling $1.20 per ordinary share.\nAdditional information regarding our financial performance during the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is included in the subsection below titled “Results of Operations.”\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be “non-GAAP financial measures” under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. We, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it \n33\nTable of Contents\nwill assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. It is important for the reader to note that the non-GAAP financial measures used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOrganic revenue growth and constant currency organic revenue growth are non-GAAP financial measures of revenue performance. Organic revenue growth is calculated by removing the impact of acquisitions and divestitures for one year following the respective transaction from the GAAP revenue growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth is subject to a further adjustment to eliminate the impact of foreign currency movements. See the section below \"Business Segment Results of Operations\" for a reconciliation of organic revenue growth and constant currency organic revenue growth to U.S. GAAP revenue.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles (capital expenditures) plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares. \nThe following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the six months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\n \n \nSix Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n707.8\n \n$\n554.5 \nPurchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, net\n(180.1)\n(210.0)\nFree cash flow\n$\n527.7\n \n$\n344.5 \nResults of Operations\nIn the following subsections, we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting earnings for the first six months of fiscal 2026 compared to the same fiscal 2025 periods. We begin with a general overview of our operating results and then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments.\nRevenues.\n The following tables compare our revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 to the revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024:\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\nPercent Change\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,460.3\n \n$\n1,328.9 \n$\n131.4 \n9.9 \n%\nRevenues by type:\nService revenues\n714.9\n \n633.0 \n81.9 \n12.9 \n%\nConsumable revenues\n452.0\n \n414.4 \n37.6 \n9.1 \n%\nCapital equipment revenues\n293.5\n \n281.5 \n11.9 \n4.2 \n%\nRevenues by geography:\nIreland revenues\n27.3\n \n22.8 \n4.5 \n19.8 \n%\nUnited States revenues\n1,075.2\n \n979.5 \n95.7 \n9.8 \n%\nOther foreign revenues\n357.8\n \n326.6 \n31.2 \n9.5 \n%\nRevenues increased 9.9% to $1,460.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $1,328.9 million for the same period in the prior year.

SG&A increased 6.2% and 5.8% in the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. The increase in SG&A during the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same prior year period, is primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by lower fees for professional services. The increase in SG&A during the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same prior year period, is primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefit costs, as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements and increased bad debt expense, partially offset by lower fees for professional services. \nResearch and Development.\n  Research and development expenses increased 4.4% and 3.8% in the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. Research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations.  During fiscal 2026, our investments in research and development have continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.\nRestructuring Expenses. \nIn May 2024, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the \"Restructuring Plan\"). This plan includes a strategic shift in our approach to the Healthcare surgical business in Europe, as well as other actions including the impairment of an internally developed X-ray accelerator, product rationalizations and facility consolidations. Approximately 300 positions have been eliminated.

The Senior Public Notes and the related guarantees\n are senior unsecured obligations of FinCo and the Guarantors, respectively, and are equal in priority with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of FinCo and the Guarantors, respectively, from time to time outstanding, including, as applicable, under the\n Private Placement Senior Notes and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAll of the liabilities of non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of Parent, other than FinCo, Limited and STERIS Corporation, including any claims of trade creditors, are effectively senior to the Senior Public Notes. \nFinCo’s main objective and source of revenues and cash flows is the provision of short- and long-term financing for the activities of Parent and its subsidiaries. \nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, interest and other fees to FinCo and ability of FinCo and Guarantors to service the Senior Public Notes may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as agreements to which our subsidiaries are or may become a party.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a summary of these guarantees:\nGuarantees of Senior Notes\n•\nParent Company Guarantor – STERIS plc\n•\nSubsidiary Issuer – STERIS Irish FinCo Unlimited Company\n•\nSubsidiary Guarantor – STERIS Limited\n•\nSubsidiary Guarantor – STERIS Corporation\nThe guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:\n•\nin the case of a subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the Indenture;\n•\nin the case of a subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the Indenture;\n•\nin the case of a subsidiary Guarantor, at such time as such subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a borrower under or no longer guarantees any material credit facility (subject to reinstatement in specified circumstances);\n•\nupon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Senior Public Notes or the discharge of FinCo’s obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;\n•\nas described in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or\n•\nin the case of Parent, if FinCo ceases for any reason to be a subsidiary of Parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of Parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any material credit facility of FinCo terminate upon FinCo ceasing to be a subsidiary of Parent; and\n•\nupon such Guarantor delivering to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction or release have been complied with.\nThe obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee are expressly limited to the maximum amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance. Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution from each Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nThe following tables present summarized results of operations for the six months ended September 30, 2025 and summarized balance sheet information at September 30, 2025 and March 31, 2025 for the obligor group of the Senior Public Notes. The obligor group consists of the Parent, FinCo, and the other Guarantors. The summarized financial information is presented after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuer and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor or issuer. Transactions with non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented separately. \nSummarized Results of Operations\n(in millions)\nSix Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n \nRevenues\n$\n1,583.0\n \nGross profit\n \n862.0\n \nOperating costs arising from transactions with non-issuers and non-guarantors, net\n340.9\n \n    Income from operations\n385.5\n \nNon-operating income arising from transactions with subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors, net \n430.4\n \n    Net income \n$\n411.8\n \n44\nTable of Contents\nSummarized Balance Sheet Information\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30,\nMarch 31,\n \n2025\n2025\nReceivables due from non-issuers and non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n20,795.7\n \n$\n19,931.5 \nOther current assets\n801.4\n \n830.5 \nTotal current assets\n$\n21,597.1\n \n$\n20,762.0 \nNon-current receivables due from non-issuers and non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n1,281.8\n \n$\n1,278.4 \nGoodwill\n610.5\n \n297.2 \nOther non-current assets\n298.0\n \n632.6 \nTotal non-current assets\n$\n2,190.3\n \n$\n2,208.2 \nPayables due to non-issuers and non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n24,823.8\n \n$\n23,557.2 \nOther current liabilities\n302.9\n \n333.7 \nTotal current liabilities\n$\n25,126.7\n \n$\n23,891.0 \nNon-current payables due to non-issuers and non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n285.9\n \n$\n285.6 \nOther non-current liabilities\n1,910.4\n \n2,060.8 \nTotal non-current liabilities\n$\n2,196.3\n \n$\n2,346.4 \nIntercompany balances and transactions between the obligor group have been eliminated, and amounts due from, amounts due to, and transactions with non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented separately.

Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions have not changed materially from March 31, 2025.\nContingencies \nWe are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, gases, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.\nWe record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable and believe we have adequately reserved for our current litigation and claims that are probable and estimable. In the event that the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. We consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. We have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. Further, we believe that the ultimate outcome of pending lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole.  Due to their inherent uncertainty, however, there can be no assurance of the ultimate outcome or effect of current or future litigation, investigations, claims or other proceedings. For certain types of claims, we presently maintain insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage and other liability coverages in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are prudent, and we may also have contractual indemnification rights against certain liabilities, but there can be no assurance that either will be applicable or adequate to cover adverse outcomes of claims or legal proceedings against us. We record expected recoveries under applicable contracts when we are assured of recovery. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for additional information.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to taxation from United States federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual jurisdiction or the closing of statutes of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. We describe income taxes further in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Income Taxes\" for more information. \nForward-Looking Statements \nThis quarterly report \nmay contain statements concerning certain trends, expectations, forecasts, estimates, or other forward-looking information affecting or relating to STERIS or its industry, products or activities that are intended to qualify for the protections afforded “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other laws and regulations. Forward-looking statements speak only as to the date the statement is made and may be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “may,” “will,” “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates,” “projects,” “targets,” “forecasts,” “outlook,” “impact,” “potential,” “confidence,” “improve,” “optimistic,” “deliver,” “orders,” “backlog,” “comfortable,” “trend,” and “seeks,” or the negative of such terms or other variations on such terms or comparable terminology.\n Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those identified in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 29, 2025. \nOther potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: \n \n(a) operating costs, pressure on pricing (including, without limitation, as a result of inflation), Customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, Customers, clients or suppliers) being greater than expected and leading to erosion of profit margins; (b) STERIS’s ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses into its existing businesses, including unknown or inestimable liabilities, impairments, or increases in expected integration costs or difficulties in connection with the integration of such businesses; (c) changes in tax laws or interpretations, including changes associated with the OBBBA, or the adoption of certain income tax treaties in jurisdictions where we operate that could increase our consolidated tax liabilities, including changes in tax laws that would result in STERIS being treated as a domestic corporation for \nUnited States\n federal tax purposes, or tariffs and/or other trade barriers; (d) the possibility that compliance with laws, court rulings, certifications, regulations, or other regulatory actions, or the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation, including the ethylene oxide litigation, may delay, limit or prevent new product or service introductions, impact production, supply and/or marketing of existing products or services, result in uncovered costs, or otherwise affect STERIS’s performance, results, prospects or value; (e) the potential of international unrest, including military conflicts, economic downturn and effects of currency fluctuations; (f) the possibility of delays in receipt of orders, order cancellations, or the manufacture or shipment of ordered products; (g) the possibility that anticipated growth, performance or other results may not be achieved, or that timing, execution, impairments, or other issues associated with STERIS’s businesses, industry or initiatives may adversely impact STERIS’s performance, results, prospects or value; (h) the impact on STERIS and its operations of any legislation, regulations or orders, including but not limited to any new trade, regulations or orders, that may be implemented by the \nU.S.\n administration or \nCongress\n, or of any responses thereto by non-U.S. governments; (i) the possibility that anticipated financial results, anticipated revenue, productivity improvements, cost savings, growth synergies, and other anticipated benefits of acquisitions, restructuring efforts, and divestitures will not be realized or will be less than anticipated; (j) the level of STERIS’s indebtedness limiting financial flexibility or increasing future borrowing costs; (k) the effects of changes in credit availability and pricing, as well as the ability of STERIS and STERIS’s Customers and suppliers to adequately access the credit markets, on favorable terms or at all, when needed; (l) the impacts of increasing competition within our industry, which may exert pressure on our pricing strategy or lead to decreasing demand for our products and services; (m) the effects on our operations resulting from labor-related issues, such as strikes, unsuccessful union negotiations and other workforce disruptions; and (n) the possibility of economic downturns and recessions, which could negatively impact our business by reducing consumer and Customer spending.\nUnless legally required, STERIS does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements even if events make clear that any projected results, express or implied, will not be realized.\nAvailability of Securities and Exchange Commission Filings\nWe make available free of charge on or through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC.
