Our global headquarters is located in Wilmington, Delaware, where we conduct discovery, clinical development and commercial operations. We also conduct clinical development and commercial operations from our European headquarters in Morges, Switzerland and our other offices across Europe, as well as our Japanese office in Tokyo and our Canadian headquarters in Montreal.\nWe are focused in two therapeutic areas that are defined by the indications of our approved medicines and the diseases for which our clinical candidates are being developed. One therapeutic area is Hematology/Oncology, which comprises Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs), Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. The other therapeutic area is Inflammation and Autoimmunity (IAI), which includes our Dermatology commercial franchise. We are also eligible to receive milestones and royalties on molecules discovered by us and licensed to third parties. \nHematology and Oncology\nOur hematology and oncology franchise comprises six approved products, which are JAKAFI (ruxolitinib), MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix)/MINJUVI (tafasitamab), PEMAZYRE (pemigatinib), ICLUSIG (ponatinib), ZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr), and NIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr), as well as numerous clinical development programs. \nJAKAFI (ruxolitinib)\nJAKAFI (ruxolitinib) is our first product to be approved for sale in the United States. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2011 for the treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF); in December 2014 for the treatment of adults with polycythemia vera (PV) who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea; in May 2019 \nfor the treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older; and in September 2021 for the treatment of chronic GVHD after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older\n. MF and PV are both myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), a type of rare blood cancer, and GVHD is an adverse immune response to an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Under our collaboration agreement with our collaboration partner Novartis Pharmaceutical International Ltd., Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib outside of the United States for all hematologic and oncologic indications and sells ruxolitinib outside of the United States under the name JAKAVI.\nIn 2003, we initiated a research and development program to explore the inhibition of enzymes called janus associated kinases (JAK). The JAK family is composed of four tyrosine kinases—JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2—that are involved in the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors. JAKs are central to a number of biologic processes, including the formation and development of blood cells and the regulation of immune functions. Dysregulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway has been associated with a number of diseases, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, other hematological malignancies, rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. \nWe have discovered multiple potent, selective and orally bioavailable JAK inhibitors that are selective for JAK1 or JAK1 and JAK2. JAKAFI is the most advanced compound in our JAK program. It is an oral JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor.\nJAKAFI is marketed in the United States through our own specialty sales force and commercial team. JAKAFI was the first FDA-approved JAK inhibitor for any indication, was the first FDA-approved product in MF, PV and steroid-refractory acute GVHD, and was recently approved in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. JAKAFI remains the first-line standard of care in MF and remains the only FDA-approved product for steroid-refractory acute GVHD. The FDA has granted JAKAFI orphan drug status for MF, PV and GVHD.\nJAKAFI is distributed primarily through a network of specialty pharmacy providers and wholesalers that allow for efficient delivery of the medication by mail directly to patients or direct delivery to the patient’s pharmacy. Our distribution process uses a model that is well-established and familiar to physicians who practice within the oncology field.\n7\nTable of Contents\n \nTo further support appropriate use and future development of JAKAFI, our U.S. Medical Affairs department is responsible for providing appropriate scientific and medical education and information to physicians, preparing scientific presentations and publications, and overseeing the process for supporting investigator sponsored trials.\nIn September 2023, we were notified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that ruxolitinib phosphate qualified for the Small Biotech Exception.\nMyelofibrosis.\n MF is a rare, life-threatening condition. MF, considered the most serious of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, can occur either as primary MF, or as secondary MF that develops in some patients who previously had polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. Based on the modern prognostic scoring systems referred to as International Prognostic Scoring System and Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System, we believe intermediate and high-risk patients represent 80% to 90% of all patients with MF in the United States and encompass patients over the age of 65, or patients who have or have ever had any of the following: anemia, constitutional symptoms, elevated white blood cell or blast counts, or platelet counts less than 100,000 per microliter of blood.\nMost MF patients have enlarged spleens and many suffer from debilitating symptoms, including abdominal discomfort, pruritus (itching), night sweats and cachexia (involuntary weight loss). There were no FDA approved therapies for MF until the approval of JAKAFI. \nThe FDA approval was based on results from two randomized Phase 3 trials (COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II), which demonstrated that patients treated with JAKAFI experienced significant reductions in splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). COMFORT-I also demonstrated improvements in symptoms. The most common hematologic adverse reactions in both trials were thrombocytopenia and anemia. These events rarely led to discontinuation of JAKAFI treatment. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions were bruising, dizziness and headache.\nIn August 2014, the FDA approved supplemental labeling for JAKAFI to include Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves as well as additional safety and dosing information. The overall survival information is based on three-year data from COMFORT-I and II and shows that at three years the probability of survival for patients treated with JAKAFI in COMFORT-I was 70% and for those patients originally randomized to placebo it was 61%. In COMFORT-II, at three years the probability of survival for patients treated with JAKAFI was 79% and for patients originally randomized to best available therapy it was 59%. In December 2016, we announced an exploratory pooled analysis of data from the five-year follow-up of the COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II trials of patients treated with JAKAFI, which further supported previously published overall survival findings.\nIn September 2016, we announced that JAKAFI had been included as a recommended treatment in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for myelofibrosis, underscoring the important and long term clinical benefits seen in patients treated with JAKAFI.\nIn October 2017, the FDA approved updated labeling for JAKAFI to include the addition of new patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from the COMFORT-I study, as well as updating the warning related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. An exploratory analysis of PRO data of patients with myelofibrosis receiving JAKAFI showed improvement in fatigue-related symptoms at Week 24. Fatigue response (defined as a reduction of 4.5 points or more from baseline in the PROMIS\n®\n Fatigue total score) was reported in 35% of patients treated with JAKAFI versus 14% of the patients treated with placebo.\nPolycythemia Vera.\n PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm typically characterized by elevated hematocrit, the volume percentage of red blood cells in whole blood, which can lead to a thickening of the blood and an increased risk of blood clots, as well as an elevated white blood cell and platelet count. \nIn December 2014, the FDA approved JAKAFI for the treatment of patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. The approval of JAKAFI for PV was based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 RESPONSE trial. In this trial, patients treated with JAKAFI demonstrated superior hematocrit control and reductions in spleen volume compared to best available therapy. In addition, a greater proportion of patients treated with JAKAFI achieved complete hematologic remission—which was defined as achieving hematocrit control and lowering platelet and white blood cell counts. In the RESPONSE trial, the most common hematologic adverse reactions (incidence > 20%) were thrombocytopenia and anemia. The most common non-hematologic adverse events (incidence >10%) were headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, pruritus, dyspnea and muscle spasms.\n8\nTable of Contents\n \nIn March 2016, the FDA approved supplemental labeling for JAKAFI to include additional safety data as well as efficacy analyses from the RESPONSE trial to assess the durability of response in JAKAFI treated patients after 80 weeks. At this time, 83% patients were still on treatment, and 76% of the responders at 32 weeks maintained their response through 80 weeks.\nIn June 2016, we announced data from the Phase 3 RESPONSE-2 study of JAKAFI in patients with inadequately controlled PV that was resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea who did not have an enlarged spleen. These data showed that JAKAFI was superior to best available therapy in maintaining hematocrit control (62.2% vs. 18.7%, respectively; P<0.0001) without the need for phlebotomy.\nIn August 2017, we announced that JAKAFI had been included as a recommended treatment in the latest NCCN Guidelines for patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to first-line therapies, such as hydroxyurea.\nGraft-versus-host disease.\n GVHD is a condition that can occur after an allogeneic HSCT (the transfer of genetically dissimilar stem cells or tissue). In GVHD, the donated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells view the recipient’s body as foreign and attack various tissues.\nIn June 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for ruxolitinib in patients with acute GVHD. In May 2019, the FDA approved JAKAFI for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. The approval was based on data from REACH1, an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of JAKAFI in combination with corticosteroids in patients with steroid-refractory grade II-IV acute GVHD. The overall response rate (ORR) in patients refractory to steroids alone was 57% with a complete response (CR) rate of 31%. The most frequently reported adverse reactions among all study participants were infections (55%) and edema (51%), and the most common laboratory abnormalities were anemia (75%), thrombocytopenia (75%) and neutropenia (58%).\nIn September 2021, the FDA approved JAKAFI for the treatment of \nchronic GVHD after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. This approval was based on data from REACH3, a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of JAKAFI in comparison to best available therapy for treatment of steroid-refractory chronic GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The overall response rate through Cycle 7 Day 1 was 70% for JAKAFI compared to 57% for best available therapy. The most common hematologic adverse reactions (incidence > 35%) were anemia and thrombocytopenia. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) were infections (pathogen not specified) and viral infection. \nIn addition, the FDA updated labeling for JAKAFI to include warnings of increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, thrombosis, and secondary malignancies related to another JAK-inhibitor treating rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which JAKAFI is not indicated. In patients with MF and PV treated with JAKAFI in clinical trials, the rates of thromboembolic events were similar in JAKAFI and control treated patients. \nWe have retained all development and commercialization rights to JAKAFI in the United States and are eligible to receive development and sales milestones as well as royalties from product sales outside the United States. We hold patents that cover the composition of matter and use of ruxolitinib and its salt. These patents, including applicable extensions, currently expire in mid and late 2028. In December 2022, we were granted pediatric exclusivity, which adds six months to the expiration for all ruxolitinib patents listed in FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) as of the date of the grant of pediatric exclusivity.\nMONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix) / MINJUVI (tafasitamab)\nIn January 2020, we and MorphoSys AG entered into a collaboration and license agreement to further develop and commercialize MorphoSys’ proprietary anti-CD19 antibody tafasitamab (MOR208) globally. Tafasitamab is an Fc-engineered antibody against CD19 currently in clinical development for the treatment of B cell malignancies. Under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement, we received rights to co-commercialize tafasitamab in the United States with MorphoSys, and exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States. As more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement with MorphoSys, and as a result, we now hold exclusive global rights for tafasitamab, and the collaboration and license agreement was terminated.\n9\nTable of Contents\n \nIn July 2020, we and MorphoSys announced that the FDA had approved MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix), which is indicated in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). MONJUVI was approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate from the MorphoSys-sponsored Phase 2 L-MIND study, an open label, multicenter, single arm trial of MONJUVI in combination with lenalidomide as a treatment for adult patients with r/r DLBCL. Results from the study showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 55% (39 out of 71 patients; primary endpoint) and a complete response (CR) rate of 37% (26 out of 71 patients). The median duration of response (mDOR) was 21.7 months. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were infections (26%), including pneumonia (7%) and febrile neutropenia (6%). Updated three-year data from L-MIND were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2021 and final five-year data were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2023, which showed that the MONJUVI plus lenalidomide regimen followed by MONJUVI monotherapy provided prolonged, durable responses in adult patients with r/r DLBCL. \nIn August 2020, we and MorphoSys announced that MONJUVI in combination with lenalidomide had been included in the latest NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for B-cell Lymphomas. \nIn August 2021, we and MorphoSys announced that the European Commission had granted conditional marketing authorization for MINJUVI (tafasitamab) in combination with lenalidomide, followed by MINJUVI monotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). The conditional approval was based on the three-year results from the L-MIND study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MINJUVI in combination with lenalidomide as a treatment for patients with r/r DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT. The results showed best objective response rate (ORR) of 56.8% (primary endpoint), including a complete response (CR) rate of 39.5% and a partial response rate (PR) of 17.3%, as assessed by an independent review committee. The median duration of response (mDOR) was 43.9 months after a minimum follow up of 35 months (secondary endpoint). MINJUVI together with lenalidomide was shown to provide a clinically meaningful response and the side effects were manageable. Warnings and precautions for MINJUVI include infusion-related reactions, myelosuppression, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, infections and tumour lysis syndrome.\nIn December 2024, we submitted a sBLA for tafasitamab in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) to the FDA.\nPEMAZYRE (pemigatinib)\nPEMAZYRE is the first internally discovered product to be internationally commercialized by us.\nIn April 2020, we announced that the FDA had approved PEMAZYRE (pemigatinib), a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. PEMAZYRE is the first FDA-approved treatment for this indication, which was approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response (DOR). \nIn March 2021, PEMAZYRE was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer (BTC) with an FGFR2 fusion gene, worsening after cancer chemotherapy. Also in March 2021, PEMAZYRE was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement that has progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. \nIn July 2021, the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended PEMAZYRE for patients with cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. NICE’s guidance enables all eligible patients in England and Wales to have access to PEMAZYRE through the National Health Service (NHS).\nIn March 2022, PEMAZYRE was approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of the People\n’\ns Republic of China for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or rearrangement as confirmed by a validated diagnostic test that has progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. \n10\nTable of Contents\n \nCholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer that arises from the cells within the bile ducts. It is often diagnosed late (stages III and IV) and the prognosis is poor. The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements is increasing, and it is currently estimated that there are 2,000-3,000 patients in the United States, Europe and Japan.\nThe approval of PEMAZYRE was based on data from FIGHT-202, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study evaluating PEMAZYRE as a treatment for adults with cholangiocarcinoma. In FIGHT-202, and in patients harboring FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements (Cohort A), PEMAZYRE monotherapy resulted in an overall response rate of 36% (primary endpoint), and median DOR of 9.1 months (secondary endpoint). FIGHT-302, a Phase 3 trial of pemigatinib for the first-line treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma and FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, is ongoing.\nIn August 2022, PEMAZYRE was approved by the FDA as the first and only targeted treatment for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 rearrangement. MLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement are extremely rare and aggressive blood cancers. \nIn March 2023, PEMAZYRE was approved by the MHLW for the treatment of MLNs with FGFR1 fusion.\nICLUSIG (ponatinib)\nIn June 2016, we acquired the European operations of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and obtained an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ICLUSIG (ponatinib) in Europe and other select countries. ICLUSIG is a kinase inhibitor. The primary target for ICLUSIG is BCR-ABL, an abnormal tyrosine kinase that is expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL).\nIn the European Union, ICLUSIG is approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase or blast phase CML who are resistant to dasatinib or nilotinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation, or the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ ALL who are resistant to dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation. \nZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr)\nIn October 2017, we and MacroGenics, Inc., announced an exclusive global collaboration and license agreement for MacroGenics’ retifanlimab (formerly INCMGA0012), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Under this collaboration, we obtained exclusive worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of retifanlimab in all indications. The molecule currently is being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination therapy across various tumor types. Two Phase 3 trials evaluating retifanlimab in squamous cell anal cancer (SCAC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are ongoing. \nIn March 2023, we announced that the FDA had approved ZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr) under accelerated approval, for the treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). This represents the first regulatory approval for our PD-1 inhibitor.\nIn April 2024, the European Commission approved ZYNYZ (retifanlimab) as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).\nIn September 2024, we announced positive results from the Phase 3 POD1UM-303/InterAACT2 trial of ZYNYZ (retifanlimab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin–paclitaxel) for the treatment of adults with inoperable locally recurrent or metastatic SCAC. \nIn December 2024, the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) submission for retifanlimab in advanced/metastatic SCAC was filed with the FDA with approval anticipated in the second half of 2025. \n11\nTable of Contents\n \nNIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr)\nIn September 2021, we and Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced an exclusive worldwide collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize axatilimab, Syndax’s anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. Together, we are developing axatilimab as a therapy for patients with chronic GVHD where CSF-1R-dependent monocytes and macrophages are believed to contribute to organ fibrosis. In December 2021, updated positive data were presented at ASH from the Phase 1/2 trial evaluating axatilimab as a monotherapy in patients with recurrent or refractory chronic GVHD after two or more prior lines of therapy. A 68% overall response rate and broad clinical benefit across multiple organs were observed at doses being assessed in AGAVE-201, a global pivotal trial evaluating axatilimab monotherapy in patients with chronic GVHD in the third line setting. In May 2022, Syndax announced that axatilimab had been granted fast-track designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with chronic GVHD after failure of two or more lines of systemic therapy.\nIn July 2023, we and Syndax announced that AGAVE-201 had met its primary endpoint across all cohorts with an overall response rate (ORR) of 74% at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg administered every two weeks. The data highlight the durable response seen at the 0.3 mg/kg dose with 60% of patients who responded to axatilimab still responding at one year. In December 2023, a Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted to the FDA for axatilimab for the treatment of patients with chronic GVHD after failure of two or more lines of systemic therapy and accepted for Priority Review in February 2024. We have initiated two combination trials with axatilimab in cGVHD in 2024, including a randomized Phase 2 combination trial with ruxolitinib and a randomized Phase 3 combination trial with steroids, both directed at treating patients with cGVHD in earlier lines of therapy. \nIn August 2024, we and Syndax announced the FDA approval of NIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr) for the treatment of chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients. NIKTIMVO is the first approved anti-CSF-1R antibody targeting the drivers of inflammation and fibrosis seen in chronic GVHD. In September, we and Syndax announced the New England Journal of Medicine publication of data from the pivotal AGAVE-201 trial of NIKTIMVO in chronic GVHD and the addition of NIKTIMVO to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for the treatment of chronic GVHD. In January 2025, the FDA approved two smaller vial sizes (9mg and 22mg) of NIKTIMVO to facilitate patient dosing and limit product waste. The U.S. commercial launch of NIKTIMVO commenced at th\ne end of January 2025. \nClinical Programs in Hematology and Oncology\nRuxolitinib\nWe are evaluating combinations of ruxolitinib with other therapeutic modalities, as well as developing a once-a-day formulation of ruxolitinib for potential use as monotherapy and in combinations. Bioavailability and bioequivalence data were published for ruxolitinib’s once-daily (QD) extended release (XR) formulation at the European Hematology Association (EHA) Virtual Congress in June 2021. In March 2023, the FDA issued a complete response letter for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets for once-daily (QD) use in the treatment of certain types of MF, PV and GVHD. In December 2023, we\n received FDA feedback and agreed on the requirements to address the complete response letter.\nPhase 2 trials combining ruxolitinib with investigational agents from our portfolio such as INCB57643 (BET) in patients with MF are ongoing with data presented demonstrating early signals of clinical activity in monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib. \nIn December 2022, new research detailing the development and mechanism of action of INCA033989, an Incyte-discovered, investigational novel anti-mutant calreticulin (CALR)-targeted monoclonal antibody, was featured in the Plenary Scientific Session at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. INCA033989 binds with high affinity to mutant CALR and inhibits oncogenesis, the process of cells becoming cancerous, in cells expressing this oncoprotein. CALR mutations are responsible for disease development in approximately 25-35% of patients with MF and ET. In July 2023, a Phase 1 study evaluating INCA033989 was initiated. \n12\nTable of Contents\n \nINCB160058 (JAK2V617Fi)\nIn December 2023, new research detailing the development and mechanism of action of INCB160058, an Incyte-discovered, investigational novel potent and selective JAK2 pseudokinase domain binder with potential to be a disease modifying therapeutic was disclosed at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.  Pseudokinase binding offers a new mechanism of action for selective inhibition of JAK2V617F, with potential to eradicate mutant clones. In preclinical studies, INCB160058 inhibited cytokine independent activity of JAK2V617F while sparing WT JAK2. The JAK2V617F mutation is found in 55% of primary myelofibrosis, 95% of polycythemia vera and 60% of essential thrombocythemia patients. A Phase 1 study of INCB160058 was initiated in the first quarter of 2024.\nTafasitamab\nTafasitamab is an anti-CD19 antibody and is being investigated as a therapeutic option in B cell malignancies in a number of ongoing and planned combination trials. An open-label Phase 2 combination trial (L-MIND) is investigating the safety and efficacy of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL), and the ongoing Phase 3 B-MIND trial is assessing the combination of tafasitamab and bendamustine versus rituximab and bendamustine in r/r DLBCL. firstMIND is a Phase 1b safety trial of tafasitamab as a first-line therapy for patients with DLBCL, and frontMIND, a placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial evaluating tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide added to rituximab plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP) as a first-line therapy for patients with DLBCL, is ongoing.\nIn January 2021, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to tafasitamab as a treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma.\nIn December 2024, we announced the full results from the pivotal Phase 3 inMIND trial evaluating treatment with tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab compared with placebo plus lenalidomide and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL).  The data showed that the study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment in 548 patients with FL. Tafasitamab was generally well-tolerated, and safety was consistent with other CD19 and immunotherapy combination regimens. \nRetifanlimab \nIn July 2024, we announced positive topline results from both the two Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating retifanlimab, \na humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1),\n in SCAC and NSCLC. The phase 3 study in SCAC met its primary endpoint of progression free survival while the Phase 3 study in NSCLC meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. The safety analysis from both studies showed retifanlimab was generally well-tolerated with no new safety signals observed. POD1UM-303 is a Phase 3, global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluating carboplatin-paclitaxel with retifanlimab or placebo in patients with inoperable locally recurrent or metastatic SCAC who have not previously been treated with chemotherapy. POD1UM-304 is a Phase 3, global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluating platinum-based chemotherapy with retifanlimab or placebo in patients with first-line, metastatic squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC. \nIn September 2024, we presented late-breaking Phase 3 results for retifanlimab that were featured during the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Presidential Symposium.

Additionally, we plan to forgo further development of our LAG-3 monoclonal antibody, TIM-3 monoclonal antibody and LAG-3xPD-1 bispecific program.  \nINCB123667 (CDK2)\nIn the cell cycle, the serine threonine kinase, CDK2, regulates the transition from the G1 phase (cell growth) to the S-phase (DNA replication). INCB123667 is a novel, potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of CDK2 which has been shown to suppress tumor growth as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care, in Cyclin E amplified tumor models, in vivo. \nIn April 2023, we presented data at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, demonstrating that INCB123667 exhibited significant single-agent activity in vivo, in CCNE1 high breast cancer xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models. INCB123667 currently is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced malignancies including CCNE1 high TNBC and HR+HER2- tumors post-CDK4/6 inhibitors.\nIn January 2024, we disclosed that early clinical activity was observed in patients with amplification/over expression of CCNE1 in a Phase 1 clinical trial, with significant tumor shrinkage observed. Several patients achieved partial responses (PR) across multiple tumor types including ovarian cancer patients with CCNE1 amplification and/or over expression. The safety data seen during this disclosure aligns with CDK2 mechanism of action. Additional data from this trial is anticipated in 2025.\n14\nTable of Contents\n \nIn September 2024, we presented initial data from the Phase 1 CDK2 inhibitor program at the 2024 ESMO Congress. Phase 1 data of INCB123667 were presented demonstrating single-agent antitumor activity across a range of doses and regimens, notably in patients with ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer whose tumors overexpress Cyclin E1. The Phase 1 trial is ongoing with INCB123667 in combination with other agents. We currently anticipate initiating a pivotal trial in ovarian cancer in 2025.\nINCB161734 (KRASG12D)\nA Phase 1 study evaluating INCB161734 (KRASG12D) was initiated in the first quarter of 2024. INCB161734 is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable KRAS G12D inhibitor and, as highlighted at AACR in April 2024, has shown excellent efficacy in several preclinical models. With no currently approved G12D-targeting agents, INCB161734 could address an important patient need as the KRASG12D mutation is found in 40% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 15% of colorectal cancers, and 5% of non-small cell lung cancers.  Data from the ongoing Phase 1 study is expected in 2025. \nINCA33890 (TGFβR2xPD-1)\n1\nINCA33890 is a TGFβR2xPD-1 bispecific antibody that has been engineered to avoid the known toxicity of broad TGFβ pathway blockade. INCA33890 has a 10-fold higher binding affinity for PD-1 relative to TGFβR2, and specifically blocks TGFβ signaling in cells co-expressing PD-1. In April 2023, we presented preclinical data at AACR that showed that INCA33890 inhibits tumor growth in PD-1-resistant mouse models. In July 2023, we initiated a Phase 1 study evaluating INCA33890 in patients with select advanced solid tumors. Data from the ongoing Phase 1 study is expected in 2025. \nInflammation and AutoImmunity (IAI)\nIncyte Dermatology launched its first approved product, OPZELURA (ruxolitinib) cream, in October 2021, following FDA approval for atopic dermatitis in September 2021. OPZELURA subsequently was approved by the FDA and European Commission for vitiligo in July 2022 and April 2023, respectively.  \nOur IAI efforts also include numerous clinical development programs. \nOPZELURA (ruxolitinib) cream\nAtopic Dermatitis\n. In September 2021, we announced that the FDA approved OPZELURA (ruxolitinib) cream, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable.\nAD is a skin disorder that causes long term inflammation of the skin resulting in itchy, red, swollen and cracked skin. Onset can occur at any age but is more common in infants and children. In the United States, we estimate that there are approximately 10 million diagnosed adolescent and adult patients with AD.\nThe approval of OPZELURA was based on data from two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies (TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD 2) evaluating the safety and efficacy of OPZELURA in adolescents and adults with mild to moderate AD. Significantly more patients treated with OPZELURA achieved Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) Treatment Success at Week 8 (defined as an IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline, the primary endpoint: 53.8% in TRuE-AD1 and 51.3% in TRuE-AD2, compared to vehicle (15.1% in TRuE-AD1, 7.6% in TRuE-AD2; P<0.0001)). Significantly more patients treated with OPZELURA experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at Week 8, as measured by a ≥4-point reduction in the itch Numerical Rating Scale (itch NRS4): 52.2% in TRuE-AD1 and 50.7% in TRuE-AD2, compared to vehicle (15.4% in TRuE-AD1, 16.3% in TRuE-AD2; P<0.0001), among patients with an NRS score of at least 4 at baseline. The most common (≥1%) treatment-emergent adverse reactions in patients treated with OPZELURA were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, bronchitis, ear infection, eosinophil count increased, urticaria, folliculitis, tonsillitis and rhinorrhea.\n1\n In collaboration with Merus.\n15\nTable of Contents\n \nVitiligo. \nIn July 2022, we announced that the FDA approved OPZELURA for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. OPZELURA was approved for continuous use and no limits to duration as a treatment for nonsegmental vitiligo.\nVitiligo is a chronic autoimmune depigmenting skin disease characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. OPZELURA is the first and only FDA approved treatment for repigmentation of vitiligo lesions.\nThe approval of OPZELURA in vitiligo was based on two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2) evaluating the safety and efficacy of OPZELURA in adolescents and adults with nonsegmental vitiligo. Treatment with 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily (BID) resulted in greater improvement versus vehicle for the primary and all key secondary endpoints in both the TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2 studies. Results, which were consistent across both studies, showed that 29.9% of patients applying ruxolitinib cream achieved >75% improvement from baseline in the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI75) at Week 24, the primary endpoint. At Week 52, approximately 50% of patients achieved F-VASI75. The most common (>1%) treatment-emergent adverse reactions in patients treated with OPZELURA were application site acne, application site pruritus, nasopharyngitis, headache, urinary tract infection, application site erythema and pyrexia. In March 2023, long-term 104-week safety and efficacy data for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) conference, demonstrating that patients who achieved a high level of facial repigmentation (≥F-VASI90) at Week 52 maintained durable response one year following withdrawal of treatment and that those patients who continued treatment with OPZELURA for up to two years demonstrated sustained facial repigmentation and further improvements in facial and total body repigmentation.\nIn April 2023, we announced that the European Commission had approved OPZELURA for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents 12 years and older following a positive opinion from the CHMP.\nIn October 2023, new results of a pooled analysis of long-term extension (LTE) data from the pivotal Phase 3 TRuE-V program assessing OPZELURA cream 1.5% in patients 12 years of age and older with nonsegmental vitiligo who previously experienced limited or no response to treatment at Week 24 were presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2023 as a late-breaking oral presentation. These results showed that patients who initially experienced limited or no facial or total body repigmentation at six months achieved improved repigmentation after continued treatment with OPZELURA for up to two years.\nIn October 2024, OPZELURA cream 1.5% was granted a Notice of Compliance by Health Canada for the topical treatment of both mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older. \nClinical Programs in Dermatology\nRuxolitinib cream\nRuxolitinib cream is a potent, selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that provides the opportunity to directly target diverse pathogenic pathways that underlie certain dermatologic conditions, including AD, vitiligo, lichen planus, lichen sclerosus, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and prurigo nodularis (PN).\nIn November 2022, we initiated two Phase 2 trials evaluating ruxolitinib cream in lichen planus and lichen sclerosus. Lichen planus is a recurrent inflammatory condition affecting the skin and mucosal surfaces and can result in itchy, purple bumps on the skin. Two Phase 3 trials evaluating ruxolitinib cream in prurigo nodularis were initiated in 2023. We continue to expand the development of ruxolitinib cream into new indications as part of our efforts to maximize the potential opportunity with ruxolitinib cream.\nIn July 2023, we announced that the Phase 3 trial (TRuE-AD3) evaluating ruxolitinib cream in pediatric AD patients (age \n>\n2 and <12) had met its primary endpoint. The study showed that significantly more patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 0.75% and 1.5% achieved Investigator's Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS) than patients treated with vehicle control.  In October 2023, the expanded results from the pivotal Phase 3 TRuE-AD3 were presented at EADV. Again, significantly more patients treated with ruxolitinib cream (0.75% and 1.5%) achieved Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS) than patients treated with vehicle control (non-medicated cream). \n16\nTable of Contents\n \nIn January 2024, we announced positive topline results from a randomized controlled Phase 2 study evaluating ruxolitinib cream in HS.  Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID met the primary efficacy endpoint as measured by a change from baseline in abscess and nodule count at Week 16 versus placebo in patients with mild to moderate HS. Ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated and consistent with its known safety profile. A Phase 3 study is expected to initiate in 2025.\nIn October 2024, we disclosed results from the Phase 2 study of ruxolitinib cream in patients with cutaneous lichen planus. At this time, we do not plan to advance ruxolitinib cream into a registrational study for lichen planus and plan to publish the results of this study in the future. Additionally, the Phase 2 study evaluating ruxolitinib cream for lichen sclerosus did not meet our internal bar for success and at this time, we are not planning to advance this indication into a registrational study.\nIn October 2024, we announced the Phase 3 trial for ruxolitinib cream in mild to moderate HS is on track to initiate in the first half of 2025 following achieving alignment on the study design with the FDA. \nPovorcitinib\nWe also are developing povorcitinib, which is an oral small molecule selective JAK1 inhibitor. Povorcitinib is undergoing evaluation in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, nonsegmental vitiligo, prurigo nodularis, asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). \nHidradenitis Suppurativa. \n HS is a chronic skin condition where lesions develop as a result of inflammation and infection of the sweat glands. In October 2020, initial results from the clinical program were presented and a randomized Phase 2b trial of povorcitinib was initiated in patients with HS. In August 2022, we presented positive results from the Phase 2 trial of povorcitinib in HS. \nIn December 2022, we initiated two Phase 3 trials (STOP-HS1 and STOP-HS2) in moderate to severe HS. \nIn February 2023, 52-week results from the Phase 2 study evaluating povorcitinib in HS were presented as an oral presentation at the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation (EHSF) Annual Meeting. The data demonstrated that longer-term treatment with povorcitinib 75 mg resulted in sustained and durable efficacy across all treatment arms and that importantly, 22-29% of patients achieved HiSCR100, which is defined as a 100% reduction from baseline in total AN count with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.\nNonsegmental Vitiligo. \nIn March 2023, 36-week results from the Phase 2b study evaluating povorcitinib in patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo were presented as an oral late-breaking presentation at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. The data demonstrated that treatment with oral povorcitinib was associated with substantial total body repigmentation in patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo, as measured by total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) scores. Specifically, the study met its primary endpoint, and patients receiving povorcitinib experienced statistically superior improvements in T-VASI at Week 24 compared to placebo.\nIn October 2023, positive 52-week data from a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of povorcitinib\n \nin adult patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo were presented at EADV as a late-breaking oral presentation. Results showed that treatment with oral povorcitinib was associated with substantial total body and facial repigmentation across all treatment groups at Week 52 and further reinforces the efficacy profile and potential of povorcitinib as an oral treatment for patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo.\nPrurigo Nodularis. \nIn October 2023, we announced that the Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study evaluating the efficacy and safety of povorcitinib\n \nin participants with PN had met its primary endpoint.  In October 2024, following the positive Phase 2 results, two \nPhase 3 studies in patients with PN were initiated. \nAsthma and Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria. \nIn July 2023, we initiated two Phase 2 trials evaluating povorcitinib in patients with moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma and in chronic spontaneous urticaria. \nData for CSU are anticipated in the first half of 2025 and data in asthma are anticipated in the second half of 2025. \n17\nTable of Contents\n \nINCB000262 (MRGPRX2) & INCB000547 (MRGPRX4)\nAs more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in May 2024, we acquired Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \nEscient is a clinical-stage drug discovery and development company advancing novel small molecule therapeutics for systemic immune and neuro-immune disorders. Escient’s clinical development portfolio includes \nINCB000262\n, a potent, highly selective, once-daily small molecule antagonist of Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor (MRGPRX2) and \nINCB000547\n, an oral MRGPRX4 antagonist. \nIn November 2024, we announced that enrollment was paused in the ongoing Phase 2 study of MRGPRX2 (INCB000262) in CSU. The decision was made following the observation of certain in vivo preclinical toxicology findings. These data have been shared with the FDA and at this time, we have no intention to enroll additional patients.  Enrollment in the other INCB000262 proof-of-concept studies in chronic inducible urticaria and AD is complete.\nIn November 2024, Incyte announced data from the Phase 2 study evaluating MRGPRX4 (INCB000547) in cholestatic pruritus did not support further development.\nIAI and Dermatology Programs\nIndication and Phase\nRuxolitinib cream (OPZELURA)\n1\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nAtopic dermatitis: Phase 3 pediatric study (TRuE-AD3)\nHidradenitis suppurativa: Phase 2; Phase 3 expected to initiate in 2025\nPrurigo nodularis: Phase 3 (TRuE-PN1, TRuE-PN2)\nPovorcitinib \n(JAK1)\nHidradenitis suppurativa: Phase 3 (STOP-HS1, STOP-HS2)\nVitiligo: Phase 3 (STOP-V1, STOP-V2)\nPrurigo nodularis: Phase 3 (STOP-PN1, STOP-PN2)\nChronic spontaneous urticaria: Phase 2\nAsthma: Phase 2\nINCA034460\n(anti-CD122)\nVitiligo: Phase 1\n1.\n \nNovartis’ rights for ruxolitinib outside of the United States under our Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis do not include topical administration.\nEarlier-Stage Development Programs in Dermatology\nINCA034460 (anti-CD122)\n In November 2022, we acquired Villaris Therapeutics, Inc., an asset-centric biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel antibody therapeutics for vitiligo. INCA034460 is a novel, humanized anti-IL-15Rβ monoclonal antibody designed to target and deplete autoreactive tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) that has demonstrated efficacy as a treatment for vitiligo in preclinical models. \nIn July 2023, INCA034460 received Investigational New Drug application (IND) clearance and in October 2023, we announced the first patient had been dosed.\nClinical Programs in Other IAI\nIn May 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 trial evaluating zilurgisertib (INCB00928) in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disorder in which muscle tissue and connective tissue are gradually replaced by bone. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation and orphan drug designation to zilurgisertib as a treatment for patients with FOP.\nOther IAI Program\nIndication and Phase\nZilurgisertib \n(ALK2)\nFibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva: Pivotal Phase 2\n18\nTable of Contents\n \nCollaborative Partnered Programs\nAs described below under “License Agreements and Business Relationships,” we are eligible for milestone payments and royalties on certain products that we licensed to third parties. These include OLUMIANT (baricitinib), which is licensed to our collaborative partner Eli Lilly and Company, and JAKAVI (ruxolitinib) and TABRECTA (capmatinib), which are licensed to Novartis. \nBaricitinib\nWe have a second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, which is subject to our collaboration agreement with Lilly, in which Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to the compound for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. \nRheumatoid Arthritis.\n Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by aberrant or abnormal immune mechanisms that lead to joint inflammation and swelling and, in some patients, the progressive destruction of joints. Rheumatoid arthritis also can affect connective tissue in the skin and organs of the body.\nCurrent rheumatoid arthritis treatments include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as methotrexate, and the newer biological response modifiers that target pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. None of these approaches to treatment is curative; therefore, there remains an unmet need for safe and effective treatment options for these patients. Rheumatoid arthritis is estimated to affect about 1% of the world’s population.\nThe Phase 3 program of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis incorporated all three rheumatoid arthritis populations (methotrexate naïve, biologic naïve, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor inadequate responders); used event rates to fully power the baricitinib program for structural comparison and non-inferiority vs. adalimumab; and evaluated patient-reported outcomes. All four Phase 3 trials met their respective primary endpoints.\nIn January 2016, Lilly submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA and an MAA to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for baricitinib as treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. In February 2017, we and Lilly announced that the European Commission approved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to, one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In July 2017, the MHLW granted marketing approval for OLUMIANT\n \nfor the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (including the prevention of structural injury of joints) in patients with inadequate response to standard-of-care therapies. In June 2018, the FDA approved the 2mg dose of OLUMIANT for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies.\nAtopic Dermatitis. \nLilly has conducted a Phase 2a trial and a Phase 3 program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The JAK-STAT pathway has been shown to play an essential role in the dysregulation of immune responses in atopic dermatitis. Therefore, we believe that inhibiting cytokine pathways dependent on JAK1 and JAK2 may lead to positive clinical outcomes in AD. \nIn February 2019, we and Lilly announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, two Phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD and, in August 2019, we and Lilly announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in BREEZE-AD7, a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with standard-of-care topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In January 2020, we and Lilly announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in both BREEZE-AD4 and BREEZE-AD5, the results of which completed the placebo-controlled data program intended to support global registrations. A supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for baricitinib was submitted by Lilly for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD. In April 2021, we and Lilly announced the FDA extended the review period for the sNDA for baricitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe AD by three months to allow time for additional data analyses. In July 2021, we and Lilly announced that the FDA will not meet the PDUFA action date for the sNDA for baricitinib for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe AD due to the FDA's ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. In January 2022, Lilly provided a regulatory update on the sNDA based on ongoing discussions with the FDA. Lilly announced that alignment with the FDA on the indicated population had not yet been reached and given the FDA’s position, there would be the possibility of a Complete Response Letter (CRL).\n19\nTable of Contents\n \nIn January 2020, Lilly announced that baricitinib had been submitted for regulatory review in Europe as a treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In October 2020, Lilly announced that the European Commission approved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. In December 2020, baricitinib was approved by the MHLW for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AD.\nAlopecia Areata\n. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the hair follicles, causing hair loss in patches. In March 2020, Lilly announced that baricitinib received Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of alopecia areata, based on the positive Phase 2 results of Lilly’s adaptive Phase 2/3 study BRAVE-AA1. In March 2021, we and Lilly announced positive results from BRAVE-AA2, the Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of once-daily baricitinib in adults with severe alopecia areata. In April 2021, we and Lilly announced positive results from the Phase 3 portion of BRAVE-AA1. In September 2021, we and Lilly announced detailed results from BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress (EADV). The two studies showed statistically significant improvement in scalp hair regrowth across both baricitinib dosing groups when compared to placebo. In March 2022, we and Lilly announced positive 52 week results from BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) annual meeting showing 40% of adults saw at least 80% scalp coverage. In June 2022, the FDA approved 2mg, and 4mg doses of OLUMIANT for the treatment of adults with severe alopecia areata, becoming the first and only systemic treatment in the indication. In June 2022, OLUMIANT was approved as a treatment for alopecia areata in Europe and Japan.\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus.\n Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease that causes inflammation. In addition to affecting the skin and joints, it can affect other organs in the body such as the kidneys, the tissue lining the lungs and heart, and the brain. Lilly has conducted a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in patients with SLE. Baricitinib’s activity profile suggests that it inhibits cytokines implicated in SLE such as type I interferon (IFN), type II IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-23 as well as other cytokines that may have a role in SLE, including granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-12. \nIn January 2022, Lilly announced the discontinuation of the Phase 3 development program for baricitinib in SLE based on top-line efficacy results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials (SLE-BRAVE-I and –II). The primary endpoint of SRI-4 response was reached in SLE-BRAVE-I but was not reached in SLE-BRAVE-II and key secondary endpoints were not met in either study.\nCOVID-19.\n In May 2020, we amended our agreement with Lilly to enable Lilly to commercialize baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19. In November 2020, we and Lilly announced that the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the distribution and emergency use of baricitinib to be used in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients two years of age or older with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In December 2020, we and Lilly announced that data from ACTT-2 supportive of the EUA were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In July 2021, we and Lilly announced that the FDA broadened the EUA for baricitinib to allow for treatment with or without remdesivir. The EUA now provides for the use of baricitinib for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).  In June 2022, we and Lilly announced the FDA approved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO.\nCapmatinib\nCapmatinib is a potent and highly selective MET inhibitor. The investigational compound has demonstrated inhibitory activity in cell-based biochemical and functional assays that measure MET signaling and MET dependent cell proliferation, survival and migration. Under our agreement, Novartis received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications. Capmatinib is being evaluated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors, and may have potential utility as a combination agent.\nMET is a clinically validated receptor kinase cancer target. Abnormal MET activation in cancer correlates with poor prognosis. Dysregulation of the MET pathway triggers tumor growth, formation of new blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and causes cancer to spread to other organs. Dysregulation of the MET pathway is seen in many types of cancers, including lung, kidney, liver, stomach, breast and brain.\n20\nTable of Contents\n \nIn May 2020, we and Novartis announced the FDA approval of capmatinib as TABRECTA for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) as detected by an FDA-approved test. TABRECTA is the first and only treatment approved to specifically target NSCLC with this driver mutation and is approved for first-line and previously treated patients regardless of prior treatment type. \nThe FDA approval of TABRECTA was based on results from the pivotal GEOMETRY mono-1 study. In the METex14 population (n=97), the confirmed overall response rate was 68% and 41% among treatment-naive (n=28) and previously treated patients (n=69), respectively, based on the Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) assessment per RECIST v1.1. In patients taking TABRECTA, the study also demonstrated a median duration of response of 12.6 months in treatment-naive patients (19 responders) and 9.7 months in previously treated patients (28 responders). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (incidence ≥20%) are peripheral edema, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. In September 2020, we and Novartis announced that GEOMETRY mono-1 results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\nIn June 2020, we and Novartis announced that the MHLW approved TABRECTA for METex14 mutation-positive advanced and/or recurrent unresectable NSCLC. In April 2022, we and Novartis announced a positive opinion from the CHMP based on data from the Phase 2 GEOMETRY mono-1 study showing an overall response rate (ORR) of 51.6% in a cohort evaluating second-line patients only and 44% in all previously-treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring alterations leading to MET exon 14 skipping.\nIn June 2022, we and Novartis announced the European Commission approval of capmatinib as TABRECTA as monotherapy treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring alterations leading to mesenchymal-epithelial-transition factor gene (MET) exon 14 (METex14) skipping who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy.\nNSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, impacting more than 2 million people per year globally. Approximately 3-4 percent of all patients with NSCLC have tumors with a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping. Though rare, this mutation is an indicator of especially poor prognosis and poor responses to standard therapies, including immunotherapy. \nRuxolitinib\nGraft-versus-host disease.\n In March 2022, we and Novartis announced a positive opinion from the CHMP for ruxolitinib in acute and chronic GVHD, based on data from the Phase 3 REACH2 and REACH3 trials. GVHD is a life-threatening complication of stem cell transplants, with no established standard of care in Europe for patients who do not adequately respond to first-line steroid treatment. In May 2022, we and Novartis announced the European Commission approval of ruxolitinib as JAKAVI for the treatment of acute or chronic GVHD in patients aged 12 years and older who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies. \nIn August 2023, Novartis announced that JAKAVI had been approved in Japan for use in graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\nPartnered Programs\nIndication and Phase\nRuxolitinib (JAKAVI)\n1\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nAcute and chronic GVHD: Approved in Europe and Japan\nBaricitinib (OLUMIANT)\n2\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nAD: Approved in Europe and Japan \nSevere alopecia areata (AA): Approved in the U.S., Europe and Japan\nRA: Approved in the U.S., Europe and Japan\nCapmatinib (TABRECTA)\n3\n(MET)\nNSCLC (with MET exon 14 skipping mutations): Approved in the U.S., Europe and Japan\n1.\nRuxolitinib (JAKAVI) licensed to Novartis outside of the United States for use in hematology and oncology excluding topical administration.\n2.\n Baricitinib (OLUMIANT) licensed to Lilly.\n3.\n Capmatinib (TABRECTA) licensed to Novartis.\n21\nTable of Contents\n \nLicense Agreements and Business Relationships\nWe establish business relationships, including collaborative arrangements with other companies and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our drugs and drug candidates and to provide support for our research programs. We also evaluate opportunities for acquiring products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business from other companies and medical research institutions.\nBelow is a brief description of our significant business relationships and collaborations and related license agreements that expand our pipeline and provide us with certain rights to existing and potential new products and technologies. Additional information regarding our collaboration agreements, including their financial and accounting impact on our business and results of operations, can be found in Note 5 and Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOut-License Agreements\nNovartis\nIn November 2009, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to ruxolitinib and certain back up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. We retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to JAKAFI (ruxolitinib) in the United States and in certain other indications. Novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our MET inhibitor compound capmatinib and certain back up compounds in all indications. We retained options to co-develop and to co-promote capmatinib in the United States. In April 2016, we amended this agreement to provide that Novartis has exclusive research, development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to ruxolitinib (excluding topical formulations) in the GVHD field.\nLilly\nIn December 2009, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Lilly. Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to baricitinib and certain back up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In March 2016, we entered into an amendment to the agreement with Lilly that allows us to engage in the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in the GVHD field. In May 2020, we amended our agreement with Lilly to enable Lilly to commercialize baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19. \nIn-License Agreements\nMacroGenics\nIn October 2017, we entered into a Global Collaboration and License Agreement with MacroGenics. Under this agreement, we received exclusive development and commercialization rights worldwide to MacroGenics’ INCMGA0012, an investigational monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-1. MacroGenics has retained the right to develop and commercialize, at its cost and expense, its pipeline assets in combination with INCMGA0012. \nMerus\nIn December 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Merus. Under this agreement, which became effective in January 2017, the parties have agreed to collaborate with respect to the research, discovery and development of bispecific antibodies utilizing Merus’ technology platform. The collaboration encompasses up to ten independent programs. \n22\nTable of Contents\n \nSyndax\nIn September 2021, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Syndax covering the worldwide development and commercialization of NIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr), Syndax’s anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. Under the terms of this agreement, we received exclusive commercialization rights to axatilimab outside of the United States, and co-commercialization rights in the United States.\nIncyte’s Approach to Drug Discovery and Development\nOur productivity in drug discovery is primarily a result of our core competency in medicinal chemistry which is tightly integrated with, and supported by, an experienced team of biologists and pharmaceutical scientists with expertise in multiple therapeutic areas. In addition to our small molecules expertise, we have added a biologics discovery capability in-house and have expanded our discovery scope to include bispecific antibodies through a collaboration with Merus.\nThis discovery team operates in concert with an equally experienced drug development organization with expertise in clinical sciences, statistics, and regulatory affairs. Our drug development organization manages our clinical programs and utilizes clinical research organizations (CROs), expert scientific advisory boards, and leading consultants and suppliers as appropriate to ensure our clinical trials are conducted efficiently, effectively, and in accordance with regulatory and compliance guidelines. \nTo succeed in our objective to discover and advance novel therapeutics that address serious unmet medical needs, we have established a broad range of discovery capabilities in-house, including target validation, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, structural biology, pharmacological and translational sciences, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and toxicology assessment. We augment these capabilities through collaborations with academic and contract laboratory resources with relevant expertise. \nDriven by a target- and pathway-centric discovery process, our pipeline has grown and is currently focused primarily in targeted oncology and dermatology. We conduct a limited number of discovery programs in parallel at any one time. This focus allows us to allocate resources to our selected programs at a level that we believe is competitive with larger pharmaceutical companies. We resource our discovery efforts with the goals of maximizing information content when and where we need it and ensuring that each program, regardless of stage, is executed in the most efficient and data-rich manner possible. We believe this approach has played a critical role in the development of our product portfolio.\nOnce our compounds reach clinical development, our objective is to rapidly progress the lead candidate into a proof-of-concept clinical trial to assess quickly the therapeutic potential of the clinical candidate itself as well as its underlying mechanism of action. This information is then used to evaluate the compound’s development opportunities, identify the most appropriate indication(s) to pursue, and develop a clinical and regulatory plan to advance the molecule.\nOur development teams are responsible for ensuring that our clinical candidates are expeditiously progressed through clinical safety, proof-of-concept, and formal efficacy/pivotal trials. Our development teams include employees with expertise in drug development, including clinical trial design, statistics, regulatory affairs, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance and project management. We have also built internal chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and formulation teams that work closely with external GMP contract manufacturers to support our drug development efforts.\nIncyte’s Commercial Strategy\nOur strategy is to develop and commercialize compounds that we have internally discovered or have acquired rights to in the markets where we believe that a company of our size can successfully compete. We currently commercialize six compounds in the United States, three in Europe and one in Japan. These commercialized products are sold to specialty and retail pharmacies, specialty distributors and wholesalers in the United States in addition to retail pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, distributors and an exclusive wholesaler outside of the United States. We continue to expand our marketing, medical and operational infrastructure within the United States and outside of the United States to support the commercial launch of recently approved products and to prepare for potential approval of other products.\nFor certain compounds, we have established and may in the future establish collaborations or strategic relationships to support development and commercialization in certain territories or therapeutic areas where we do not have or do not want to build expertise. We believe the key benefits to entering into such strategic relationships include the potential to expedite the development and commercialization of certain of our compounds, as well as the opportunity to \n23\nTable of Contents\n \nreceive upfront payments and future milestones and royalties in exchange for certain rights to those compounds. Refer to the “License Agreements and Business Relationships” section above for information regarding our collaborations and strategic relationships. \nPatents, Other Intellectual Property, and Product Exclusivity\nWe regard the protection of patents and other enforceable intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our business and competitive position. Accordingly, we rely on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, to protect our intellectual property. We have established a patent portfolio of patents and patent applications owned or licensed by us that cover aspects of our drug products and drug candidates. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries that we believe are commercially important to the development and growth of our business. As a general matter, we endeavor to obtain patent term extensions (PTEs) in the United States and Japan, and other countries where available, and supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) in each European country, upon approval by the respective regulatory agency, if patent rights are granted in such country. \nThe following table sets forth the year in which the basic exclusivity loss is currently estimated to occur in the United States, the European Union, and Japan for each of our approved medicines and for those compounds in our portfolio that have been submitted to regulatory authorities seeking approval or are in registration-directed clinical trials. We refer to the basic exclusivity loss as the “Estimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Date,” which is, unless otherwise indicated, the latter of (i) the expiration date of the earliest anticipated expiring composition of matter patent rights, or (ii) the date of regulatory data protection (RDP) loss for such product or clinical candidate. There may be additional patents for our approved medicines that claim the medicine or a method of using it that are listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book)—or for our unapproved clinical candidates that will be eligible to be listed in the Orange Book upon FDA approval. Therefore, the table below also identifies the expiration dates of certain additional patents that are Orange-Book listed for our approved medicines—or that, for our unapproved clinical candidates, are eligible for Orange-Book listing upon product approval—in the United States, as well as the expiration dates of certain related patents in the European Union, and Japan, which we refer to as the “Additional Patents Expiry Dates.” \n24\nTable of Contents\n \nProduct/Drug Candidate\n1,2\nUS\nEU\nJapan\nJAKAFI\n \n(ruxolitinib)\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2028\n2027\n2028\nAdditional Patents Expiry Dates\n3\n2028\n2028\n2028\nOPZELURA\n \n(ruxolitinib) cream\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2028\n2027\n2026\nAdditional Patents Expiry Dates\n3,4\n2028, 2031 & 2040\n2028 & 2031\n2028 & 2031\nOLUMIANT (baricitinib)\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2032\n5\n2032\n2033\nAdditional Patents Expiry Dates\n2032\n2032\n-\nTABRECTA (capmatinib)\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2032\n5\n2032\n6\n2032\nAdditional Patents Expiry Dates\n2035\n2035\n2035\nPEMAZYRE\n \n(pemigatinib)\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2035\n2036\n6\n2036\nAdditional Patents Expiry Dates\n2039 & 2040\n-\n-\nICLUSIG (ponatinib)\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n-\n2028\n-\nAdditional Patents Expiry Dates\n-\n-\n-\nZYNYZ\n \n(retifanlimab)\n8\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2036\n2036\n2036\nMONJUVI (tafasitamab)\n9\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2033\n5\n2032\n6\n2027\nNIKTIMVO (axatilimab)\n10\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2036\n7\n2034\n2034\nruxolitinib XR\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2028\n-\n-\nAdditional Patents Expiry Dates\n3,11\n2028 & 2033\n-\n-\npovorcitinib\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates\n2034\n2034\n2034\nAdditional Patents Expiry Dates\n2039 & 2041\n2039\n-\n1.\nEstimated Minimum Market Exclusivity Dates are subject to the payment of maintenance fees, and include the period of PTE that has been granted by the respective regulatory agency, where applicable, or include the period of anticipated SPC term for approved products in the EU, where applicable, even though SPCs may remain pending in some countries.\n2.\nFor approved medicines in the US, the brand name for the US product is used, whereas for candidates that have not been approved in the US, the name of the active ingredient is used. The use of a brand name in the table does not indicate that the product has also been approved in any country outside of the US Also, some products may be approved in one or more countries outside of the US under different brand names.\n3.\nRuxolitinib phosphate salt patents are issued in the US, EU and Japan with anticipated expiration dates of late-2028 in the US and mid-2028 in the EU and Japan.\n4.\nRuxolitinib cream formulation patents are issued in the US, EU and Japan with anticipated expiration dates of 2031 in each jurisdiction.

The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. \nWe may seek to license rights relating to technologies, drug candidates or drug products in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization activities. Under these licenses, such as our licenses from Agenus, ARIAD/Takeda, MacroGenics, Merus, Xencor and Syndax, we may be required to pay up-front fees, license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products. \n25\nTable of Contents\n \nPatents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. \nWe may seek to license rights relating to technologies, drug candidates or drug products in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization activities. Under these licenses, such as our licenses from Agenus, ARIAD/Takeda, MacroGenics, Merus Xencor and Syndax, we may be required to pay up-front fees, license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products. \nAlthough we believe our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes and may not be able to obtain patents in the United States or elsewhere from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be valid or enforceable or may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us or provide us with a competitive advantage. Any patent or other intellectual property rights that we own or obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors. Others may have patents that relate to our business or technology and that may prevent us from marketing our drug candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents. In addition, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement, to enforce patents, to protect our other intellectual property rights, to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties or to defend ourselves in patent or other intellectual property right suits brought by third parties. We could incur substantial costs in such litigation or other proceedings. An adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liability or increased competition. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. “Risk Factors\n \n— Risks Relating to Intellectual Property and Legal Matters,” and the discussion of legal proceedings related to certain patents is set forth in\n \nItem 1A. “Risk Factors\n \n— Risks Relating to Commercialization of Our Products — Competition for our products could harm our business and result in a decrease in revenue.”\nWith respect to proprietary information that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. While, as a general matter, we seek to protect our interests by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and potential business partners, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nCompetition\nOur drug discovery, development and commercialization activities face, and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. We face significant competition from organizations, particularly fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, that are pursuing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with JAKAFI, ICLUSIG, PEMAZYRE, MONJUVI/MINJUVI, OPZELURA, ZYNYZ, NIKTIMVO and our drug candidates.\nMany companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources, larger drug discovery, development and commercial staffs and significantly greater experience than we do in:\n•\ndrug discovery;\n•\ndeveloping products;\n•\nundertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials;\n•\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products; and\n•\nmanufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling products.\n26\nTable of Contents\n \nAccordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA and other regulatory approval or commercializing products that compete with JAKAFI, ICLUSIG, PEMAZYRE, MONJUVI/MINJUVI, OPZELURA, ZYNYZ, NIKTIMVO or our drug candidates.\nIn addition, any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use. Competition may also arise from:\n•\nother drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease;\n•\nnew compounds; or\n•\nother classes of therapeutic agents.\nWe face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to drug candidates or proprietary technology. These competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing products that are more effective or commercially successful than ours.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n•\ndevelop proprietary products;\n•\ndevelop and maintain products that reach the market first, are technologically superior to and/or are of lower cost than other products in the market;\n•\nattract and retain scientific, product development and sales and marketing personnel;\n•\nobtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;\n•\nobtain required regulatory approvals; and\n•\nmanufacture, market, distribute and sell any products that we develop.\nIn a number of countries, including in particular, developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs available at a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for their drugs in certain developing countries. If certain countries do not permit enforcement of any of our patents, sales of our products in those countries, and in other countries by importation from low-price countries, could be reduced by generic competition or by parallel importation of our product. Alternatively, governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products in those countries, thereby reducing our product sales, or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for our products. In all of these situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and marketing of our approved drug products and our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any drug developed by us must undergo rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials, and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution and import and export, of these products. \n27\nTable of Contents\n \nFDA Review and Approval Process\nThe regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The steps generally required before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:\n•\npreclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice and Good Manufacturing Practice regulations;\n•\nsubmission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;\n•\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;\n•\nsubmission of an NDA or Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for review;\n•\nrandom inspections of clinical sites to ensure validity of clinical safety and efficacy data;\n•\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices;\n•\nFDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and\n•\npayment of user and program fees, if applicable.\nSimilar requirements exist within foreign agencies as well. The time required to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.\nPreclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology, drug metabolism, and toxicity which includes animal studies, to assess potential safety and efficacy as well as product chemistry, stability, formulation, development, and testing. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial(s) included in the IND. In the latter case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations covering the protection of human subjects. These regulations require all research subjects to provide informed consent. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and each trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB) before it can begin.\nClinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical evidence of efficacy and safety, and providing an adequate basis for labeling. We cannot guarantee that Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the IRB, or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.\n28\nTable of Contents\n \nAs a separate amendment to an IND, a clinical trial sponsor may submit to the FDA a request for a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). Under the SPA procedure, a sponsor may seek the FDA’s agreement on the design and size of a clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. If the FDA agrees in writing, its agreement may not be changed after the trial begins, except when agreed by FDA or in limited circumstances, such as when a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety and effectiveness of a drug candidate is identified after a Phase 3 clinical trial is commenced and agreement is obtained with the FDA. If the outcome of the trial is successful, the sponsor will ordinarily be able to rely on it as the primary basis for approval with respect to effectiveness. However, additional trials could also be requested by the FDA to support approval, and the FDA may make an approval decision based on a number of factors, including the degree of clinical benefit as well as safety. The FDA is not obligated to approve an NDA or BLA as a result of an SPA agreement, even if the clinical outcome is positive.\nEven after initial FDA approval has been obtained, post-approval trials, or Phase 4 studies, may be required to provide additional data, and will be required to obtain approval for the sale of a product as a treatment for a clinical indication other than that for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA will require post-approval safety reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of post-approval programs may limit or expand the indication or indications for which the drug product may be marketed. Further, if there are any requests for modifications to the initial FDA approval for the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, manufacturing facilities, or labeling, a supplemental NDA or BLA may be required to be submitted to the FDA.\nThe length of time and related costs necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or cause the costs of these clinical trials to increase, include:\n•\nslow patient enrollment due to the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study, competition with clinical trials for other drug candidates or other factors;\n•\ninadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials;\n•\ndelays in approvals from a study site’s IRB;\n•\nlonger than anticipated treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or determine the appropriate product dose;\n•\nlack of sufficient supplies of the drug candidate for use in clinical trials;\n•\nadverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and\n•\nlack of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested.\nAny drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level, and at any time in the course of animal studies designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as toxicological studies, or in clinical trials of our drug candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our drug candidates, and could ultimately prevent their marketing approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.\nThe FDA’s fast track, breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval, and priority review designation programs are intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review and approval of drug candidates intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for these conditions. Under these programs, FDA can, for example, review portions of an NDA or BLA for a drug candidate before the entire application is complete, thus potentially beginning the review process at an earlier time. The FDA, however, can mandate, and has mandated, post-approval requirements that could include lengthy and extensive confirmatory clinical trials. The FDA has recently increased its focus on accelerated approvals for oncology drugs and the confirmatory trials required for those drugs.\n29\nTable of Contents\n \nWe cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant any of our requests for any of these expedited program designations, that any such designations would affect the time of review or that the FDA will approve the NDA or BLA submitted for any of our drug candidates, whether or not these designations are granted. Additionally, FDA approval of a product can include restrictions on the product’s use or distribution (such as permitting use only for specified medical conditions or limiting distribution to physicians or facilities with special training or experience). Approval of such designated products can be conditioned on additional clinical trials after approval.\nSponsors submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. NDAs and BLAs must also contain extensive product manufacturing information and proposed labeling. Upon receipt, the FDA initially reviews the NDA or BLA to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to initiate a substantive review. If the FDA identifies deficiencies that would preclude substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the NDA or BLA and will inform the sponsor of the deficiencies that must be corrected prior to resubmission. If the FDA accepts the submission for review (then deemed a “filing”), the FDA typically completes the NDA or BLA review within a pre-determined time frame. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA agrees to review NDAs and BLAs under either a standard review or priority review. FDA procedures provide for priority review of NDAs and BLAs submitted for drugs that, compared to currently marketed products, if any, offer a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. The FDA seeks to review NDAs and BLAs that are granted priority status more quickly than NDAs and BLAs given standard review status. The FDA’s stated policy is to act on 90% of priority NDAs and BLAs within eight months of receipt (or six months after filing, which occurs within 60 days after NDA or BLA submission). Although the FDA historically has not met these goals, the agency has made significant improvements in the timeliness of the review process. NDA and BLA review often extends beyond anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional data or clarification, the submission of a major amendment by the Sponsor, the FDA’s decision to have an advisory committee review, and difficulties in scheduling an advisory committee meeting. The recommendations of an advisory committee are not binding on the FDA.\nTo obtain FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the patient population that will be treated. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical trials. Marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited. Furthermore, approval may entail requirements for post-marketing studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, including the need for patient and/or physician education, patient registries, medication or similar guides, or other restrictions on the distribution of the product. If an NDA or BLA does not satisfy applicable regulatory criteria, the FDA may deny approval of an NDA or BLA or may issue a complete response, and require, among other things, additional clinical data or analyses.\nThe Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan drug designation or conditions affecting 200,000 or more people in the United States where the disease or condition occurs so infrequently that there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of drug development and marketing will be recovered in future sales of the drug in the United States. The first developer to receive FDA marketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the United States for the orphan drug indication. However, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven year exclusive marketing period.\nRegulation of Manufacturing Process\nEven when NDA or BLA approval is obtained, a marketed product, such as JAKAFI, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market. Manufacturing facilities are always subject to inspection by the applicable regulatory authorities.\n30\nTable of Contents\n \nWe and our third-party manufacturers are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP's, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes and controls, including but not limited to release and stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by FDA 21CFR, parts 210 and 211, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, and the European Medicines Agency. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the applicable regulatory authorities and are subject to manufacturing licenses where applicable. These facilities, whether our own or our contract manufacturers, may be inspected before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our related products. We or our contract manufacturers must be able to comply with all applicable cGMP's and FDA or other regulatory requirements. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply, we or our contract manufacturers may be subject to legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing license(s), seizure of product, or voluntary recall of product. Furthermore, continued compliance with applicable GMP will require continual expenditure of time, money and effort on the part of the Company or our contract manufacturers in the areas of production and quality control and record keeping and reporting, in order to ensure full compliance.\nPost-Approval Regulation\nAny products manufactured or distributed by the Company pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug and other reporting, advertising and promotion restrictions. The FDA’s rules for advertising and promotion require, among other things, that our promotion be fairly balanced and adequately substantiated by clinical studies, and that we do not promote our products for unapproved uses. We must also submit appropriate new and supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process or controls. On its own initiative, the FDA may require changes to the labeling of an approved drug if it becomes aware of new safety information that the agency believes should be included in the approved drug’s labeling. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.\nIn addition to inspections related to manufacturing, we are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies related to the other regulatory requirements that apply to marketed drugs manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA also may conduct periodic inspections regarding our review and reporting of adverse events, or those related to compliance with the requirements of the PDMA concerning the handling of drug samples. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors may identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations. The observations may be more or less significant. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations, we likely will be required to respond in writing, and may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the FDA’s concerns.\nThere are a variety of state laws and regulations that apply in the states or localities where JAKAFI and our new drug candidates are or may be marketed. For example, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in that state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market, or increase the cost of marketing, our products in those states or localities.\nThe FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could impose additional burdens or limitations on our ability to market products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the United States and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation which might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.\n31\nTable of Contents\n \nMarketing Exclusivity\nThe FDA may grant five years of exclusivity in the United States for the approval of NDAs for new chemical entities, and three years of exclusivity for supplemental NDAs, for among other things, new indications, dosages or dosage forms of an existing drug, if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are essential to the approval of the supplemental application. Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the United States is available if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a sponsor submits and the agency accepts requested information relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. The six month pediatric exclusivity is added to any existing patent or non-patent exclusivity period for which the drug is eligible. Orphan drug products are also eligible for pediatric exclusivity if the FDA requests and the company completes pediatric clinical trials. Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, the FDA may grant 12 years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products.\nForeign Regulation\nOutside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities in specific regions or countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Union (EU) regional registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one EU member state. If the competent regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization may be granted. This foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above and may also include additional risks.\nWhether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, a CTA must be submitted for each trial to the competent health authority and to independent ethics committees by national procedure for a single country trial or by EMA submission portal CTIS for a multinational study. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with the requirements in the concerned countries, clinical trial development may proceed in those countries and are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.\nTo obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). This application is similar to the NDA or BLA in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, regional and/or country-specific document requirements. Drugs can be authorized in the EU by using the centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized or national authorization procedures described below.\nThe European Medicines Agency implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human drugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EU. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use). A positive opinion on the MAA by the CHMP then needs to be endorsed by the European Commission within approximately 67 days. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, in which case the EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days (excluding clock stops) and the opinion issued thereafter.\nThe mutual recognition procedure (MRP) for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the EU. The MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by EU member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.\n32\nTable of Contents\n \nShould any member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, the member states shall make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.\nLegislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries outside of the United States, including the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons, are life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and for which no satisfactory treatment is authorized. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product does not justify maintenance of market exclusivity.\nFor other countries outside of the EU, such as non-EU countries in Eastern Europe, Middle-East, Latin America, Japan or other countries in Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nManufacturing\nOur manufacturing strategy is to contract with third parties to manufacture the raw materials, our active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and finished dosage form for clinical and commercial uses. We currently do not operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of JAKAFI, ICLUSIG, PEMAZYRE, OPZELURA, MONJUVI/MINJUVI, ZYNYZ and NIKTIMVO or our drug candidates. As such, we expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of the raw materials, API and finished drug product for drugs that we successfully develop and are approved for commercial sale. In this manner, we continue to build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. \nIn July 2018, we purchased land located in Yverdon, Switzerland, for construction of a large molecule production facility to manufacture biologic drug substances for our drug candidates. Construction activity commenced in July 2018, and in June 2022 Swissmedic authorities granted the GMP drug manufacturing license for this facility. The Yverdon facility started to manufacture MONJUVI/MINJUVI drug substance during the fourth quarter of 2022. The drug substance is usable in patients after regulatory approval, which was granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the European market and is currently expected in the second quarter of 2025 in the United States.\nManufacturing of our Products\nOur supply chain for manufacturing raw materials, API and drug product ready for distribution and commercialization is a multi-step international process. Establishing and managing the supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships.\nWe contract with third parties to manufacture JAKAFI, ICLUSIG, MONJUVI/MINJUVI, PEMAZYRE, OPZELURA, ZYNYZ, NIKTIMVO and our drug candidates for clinical and commercial purposes. Third-party manufacturers supply raw materials, and other third-party manufacturers convert these raw materials into API or convert the API into final dosage form. For most of our drug candidates, once our raw materials are produced, we rely on one third-party to manufacture the API, another to make finished drug product and a third to package and label the finished product. For ruxolitinib phosphate, the API for JAKAFI and OPZELURA, we have three qualified third-party contract manufacturers from which we can source drug substance, one of which is currently active. The manufacturing of ponatinib, the API for ICLUSIG, is the sole responsibility of Takeda, the intellectual property holder. We procure API from Takeda, which outsources the API manufacturing to a third party. For pemigatinib, the API for PEMAZYRE, we have one qualified third-party contract manufacturer from which we can source drug substance.\n33\nTable of Contents\n \nWe also rely on third-party contract manufacturers to tablet or capsulate all of our active pharmaceutical ingredients for clinical and commercial uses. For JAKAFI and ICLUSIG, we have two qualified third-party manufacturers from which we can source commercial drug product. Secondary packaging of ICLUSIG is performed by a qualified third-party manufacturer. Primary packaged product for ICLUSIG can be used for clinical and commercial purposes. For PEMAZYRE, we have one qualified third-party manufacturer from which we can source commercial drug product. For OPZELURA, we have two qualified third-party manufacturer from which we can source commercial drug product for the United States market, and one qualified third-party manufacture from which we can source commercial drug product for markets outside of the United States. \nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of any of our raw materials, drug candidates, API, or finished goods if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. If any of these single source suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to supply us with API or finished product that complies with applicable regulatory requirements, we could incur significant delays in our clinical trials or interruption of commercial supply which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have established a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers and service providers produce materials and provide services, as applicable, in accordance with the FDA and EMA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations. Our quality assurance program extends to our licensed facilities that oversee the manufacturing and distribution activities.\nFor our future products, we intend to continue to establish third-party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our drug candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any product that is approved for commercial sale. If we are unable to contract for large scale manufacturing with third parties on acceptable terms for our future products or develop manufacturing capabilities internally, our ability to conduct large scale clinical trials and meet customer demand for commercial products will be adversely affected. \nThird-party Manufacturers\nOur third-party manufacturers are independent entities, under contract with us, who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nFor products manufactured by our third-party manufacturers, we have licensed the necessary aspects of this manufacturing technology that we believe is proprietary to us to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We have agreements with these third-party manufacturers that are intended to restrict these manufacturers from using or revealing our technology, but we cannot be certain that these third-party manufacturers will comply with these restrictions.\nWhile we believe there are multiple third parties capable of providing most of the materials and services we need in order to manufacture API and distribute finished goods, and that supply of materials that cannot be second sourced can be managed with inventory planning, there is always a risk that we may underestimate demand, and that our manufacturing capacity through third-party manufacturers may not be sufficient. In addition, because of the significant lead times involved in our supply chain for ruxolitinib phosphate, we may have less flexibility to adjust our supply in response to changes in demand than if we had shorter lead times. Our strategy is to maintain 18 to 24 months of safety stock of API to be able to respond to changes in demand to provide on-time supply of drug product as well as at least 6 months of semi-finished goods inventory.\n34\nTable of Contents\n \nAccess to Supplies and Materials\nOur third-party manufacturers need access to certain supplies and products to manufacture our products and drug candidates. If delivery of material from their suppliers were interrupted for any reason or if they are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of raw materials used to manufacture our products and drug candidates, they may be unable to ship our products for commercial supply or to supply our drug candidates in development for clinical trials. For example, currently raw materials used to manufacture ruxolitinib phosphate, the API in JAKAFI and OPZELURA, are supplied by Chinese-based companies. As a result, an international trade dispute between China and the United States or any other actions by the Chinese government that would limit or prevent Chinese companies from supplying these materials would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our products to meet market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. We are currently in the process of qualifying additional European suppliers to reduce the dependency of our key raw materials on Chinese-based suppliers.\nHuman Capital\nOur human capital management philosophy is committed to promoting an environment where our colleagues are fulfilled and valued. We promote a company culture based on scientific excellence as we seek to create new treatments; we are creative in our development strategies; and we seek positive collaboration with each other. Working collaboratively is of the utmost importance as we aim to change the treatment landscape for patients with cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It is our goal to conduct business in a manner that does not compromise the health of people or the state of the environment. It is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulatory requirements and seek to continually improve our EHS management systems. A strong safety culture is a fundamental part of how we work, and our philosophy is that everyone at Incyte has a responsibility to create and maintain a safe and healthy workplace to reduce risk and prevent injuries. \nWe appreciate one another’s differences and strengths and are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We value diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, and our policy is that we do not discriminate based on race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, military and veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic as established by federal, state or local laws. Further, we have policies in place that prohibit harassment of all kinds. At Incyte, we prohibit retaliation in all forms and are committed to encouraging a culture where employees can freely ask questions and raise concerns. Our management team makes themselves available to all employees and quarterly global Town Hall events allow for an open question-and-answer dialogue. \n \nWe believe that creative solutions are best achieved by diverse teams working together, and inclusion is therefore essential to Incyte. Diversity of thoughts, backgrounds, perceptions, and ideas help us create the medical solutions that patients require, and represent the lifeblood of organizations such as ours. We have an Inclusion Committee, which is co-chaired by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, to bring forth actionable plans across multiple focus areas. We have continued to expand our recruitment searches to include organizations and websites dedicated to Black candidates. We post all of our open positions on the Historically Black Colleges and Universities career pages and participate in diversity career fairs with national organizations such as the National Black MBA Association, National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists & Chemical Engineers (NOBBChE) and National Sales Network to expand our recruitment reach. \nWe offer what we believe is a competitive compensation package, which allows 100% of global Incyte employees to participate in our annual incentive compensation plan as well as annual equity-based grants. We seek to ensure our compensation package remains competitive by benchmarking against our peers several times annually as well as conducting annual compensation reviews to confirm that our employees are being compensated fairly, equitably and in accordance with our pay structures and job levels. In addition, we offer what we believe is a competitive benefits package, which includes an option to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for both full-time and part-time employees working at least 20 hours per week. We believe that our health insurance coverage is industry-leading, as it provides 100% coverage for full-time employees and is 95% subsidized for part-time employees working at least 20 hours per week in the United States. Beyond compensation and benefits, we are committed to supporting our colleagues in their professional development. Opportunities for growth are provided through challenging job assignments, performance management and training opportunities. Globally, all full-time employees are eligible for tuition reimbursement. We believe these professional opportunities enhance our colleagues’ skills, career aspirations and job satisfaction as well as provide personal enrichment.\n35\nTable of Contents\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 2,617 employees, representing an increase of approximately 4% over our 2,524 employees as of the end of the prior year. This growth is largely a result of continued expansion of our global commercial reach for our business operations. Among our employees, 896 are in research and development, 212 in medical affairs, 807 in sales and marketing and 702 in operations support and administrative positions. Geographically, 72% of our employees were based in the United States and Canada, 26% in Europe and 2% in Asia. In terms of gender diversity, 1,341 are female, 1,260 are male and 16 are non-binary/prefer not to say. Our employees in Austria, Belgium and Spain are covered by collective agreements, and management considers relations with our employees to be good.\nAvailable Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 1991 and our website is located at \nwww.incyte.com\n.

These website addresses are intended to be inactive, textual references only. None of the materials on, or accessible through, these websites are part of this report or are incorporated by reference herein. \nOverview\nIncyte is a global biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics. Our global headquarters is located in Wilmington, Delaware, where we conduct discovery, clinical development and commercial operations. We also conduct clinical development and commercial operations from our European headquarters in Morges, Switzerland and our other offices across Europe, as well as our Japanese office in Tokyo and our Canadian headquarters in Montreal.\nThrough the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics, Incyte has established a portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class medicines for patients and a strong pipeline of products focused in three core therapeutic areas: Oncology, Inflammation & Autoimmunity, and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) & Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD). We are also eligible to receive milestones and royalties on molecules discovered by us and licensed to third parties. \nOur portfolio focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and includes compounds in various stages, ranging from preclinical to late-stage development, and commercialized products JAKAFI (ruxolitinib), ICLUSIG (ponatinib), PEMAZYRE (pemigatinib), OPZELURA (ruxolitinib cream), MINJUVI (tafasitamab), MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix) and ZYNYZ (retifanlimab-dlwr), as well as NIKTIMVO (axatilimab-csfr), which was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2024 and will be co-commercialized.\nOur revenues depend on continued sales of our products, and we depend substantially on product revenues from JAKAFI. We must develop and commercialize new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses from when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1 of this report, “Business—Patents and Other Intellectual Property” and “Business—Competition.” We devote substantial resources to research and development activities and to acquire rights to new product candidates and technologies, but successful product development in the biopharmaceutical industry is highly uncertain.\nOur product revenues also face challenges from economic conditions and drug pricing initiatives driven by governments and private payors. See Part I, Item 1A of this report, “Risk Factors” for a further discussion of certain factors that could impact our future product revenues.\n68\nTable of Contents\n \nLicense Agreements, Business Relationships and Acquisitions\nWe establish business relationships, including collaborative arrangements with other companies and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our drugs and drug candidates and to provide support for our research programs. We also establish business relationships with other companies and medical research institutions to acquire products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete list of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition.\n We recognize revenue only when we have satisfied a performance obligation through transferring control of the promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation, which for the Company is at a point in time. We also assess collectability based primarily on the customer’s payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.\nProduct Revenues\nProduct revenues are recognized once we satisfy the performance obligation at a point in time under the revenue recognition criteria as described above. We recognize revenues for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, returns, distribution service fees, patient assistance programs, and government rebates, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part D coverage gap reimbursements in the United States and mandated discounts in Europe. These sales allowances and accruals are recorded based on estimates which are described in detail below. Estimates are assessed as of the end of each reporting period and are updated to reflect current information. We believe that our sales allowances and accruals are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2024, a 5% change in our sales allowance and accruals would have had an approximate $79.9 million impact on our income before taxes.\n \nCustomer Credits:\n Our customers are offered various forms of consideration, including allowances, service fees and prompt payment discounts. We expect our customers will earn prompt payment discounts and, therefore, we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized. Service fees are also deducted from total product sales as they are earned.\nRebates and Discounts:\n We accrue rebates for mandated discounts under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the United States and mandated discounts in Europe in markets where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare. These accruals are based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. \nOur estimates for expected utilization of commercial insurance rebates are based on data received from our customers. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters’ unpaid rebates. If actual future rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.\n69\nTable of Contents\n \nChargebacks: \nChargebacks are discounts that occur when certain indirect contracted customers purchase directly from our wholesalers at a discounted price. The wholesalers, in turn, charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesalers and the discounted price paid by the contracted customers. In addition to actual chargebacks received, we maintain an accrual for chargebacks based on the estimated contractual discounts on the inventory levels on hand in our distribution channel. If actual future chargebacks vary from these estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.\nMedicare Part D Coverage Gap:\n Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to fund \n70%\n of the Medicare Part D insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. Our estimates for the expected Medicare Part D coverage gap are based on historical invoices received and in part from data received from our customers. Funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. If actual future funding varies from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.\nCo-payment Assistance:\n Patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. We accrue a liability for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators.\nProduct Royalty Revenues\nRoyalty revenues on commercial sales for JAKAVI and TABRECTA by Novartis are estimated based on information provided by Novartis. Royalty revenues on commercial sales for OLUMIANT by Lilly are estimated based on information provided by Lilly. Royalty revenues on commercial sales for PEMAZYRE by Innovent are estimated based on information provided by Innovent. We recognize royalty revenues in the period the sales occur. We exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon. If actual royalties vary from estimates, we may need to adjust the prior period, which would affect royalty revenue and receivable in the period of adjustment. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual royalty revenues have not been material to our financial results and have been less than 1% of royalty revenues.\nMilestone and Contract Revenues\nAt the inception of a contract, we determine the transaction price, in addition to any upfront payment, by estimating the amount of variable consideration, including milestone payments, at the outset of the contract utilizing the most likely amount method. Our contractual milestones typically relate to the achievement of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization events outside of our control, such as regulatory approval of a compound, first patient dosing or achievement of sales-based thresholds. We include milestones in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the milestone is subsequently resolved. Given the high level of uncertainty of achievement, variable consideration associated with milestones are fully constrained until confirmation of the satisfaction or completion of the milestone by the third-party. We review our estimate of the transaction price each period, and make revisions to such estimates as necessary.\nStock Compensation.\n Share-based payment transactions with employees, which include stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance shares (PSUs), are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their estimated fair values at the date of grant as well as expected forfeiture rates based on actual experience, subject to customary retirement provisions that may accelerate the requisite service period for expense recognition purposes. The stock compensation process requires the use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility over the option term and expected option lives, as well as expected forfeiture rates and the probability of PSUs vesting. For the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023, our Black-Scholes assumptions included a weighted-average stock price volatility of 30% in 2024 and 32% in 2023, average expected option life of approximately five years and an estimated annualized forfeiture rate of 5%. The average risk-free interest rate assumption used in the Black-Scholes valuations increased from 4.01% in 2023 to 4.15% in 2024.\n70\nTable of Contents\n \nThe fair value of stock options, which are subject to graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. The fair value of RSUs that are subject to cliff vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method, and the fair value of RSUs that are subject to graded vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. The fair value of PSUs are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement. We assess the probability of achievement of performance conditions, including projected product revenues and clinical development milestones, as of the end of each reporting period. Once a performance condition is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that award, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method for PSUs that are subject to cliff vesting and using the accelerated attribution method for PSUs that are subject to graded vesting. Compensation expense for PSUs with market performance conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant and recorded over the requisite service period.\nIncome Taxes.\n We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to financial accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the basis differences are expected to reverse. We periodically assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets to an amount that is considered to be more-likely-than-not to be realizable. Our assessment considers recent cumulative earnings experience, projections of future taxable income (losses) and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. When performing our assessment on projections of future taxable income (losses), we consider factors such as the likelihood of regulatory approval and commercial success of products currently under development, among other factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of such reversal.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit that is recorded for these positions is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Any interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included within the tax provision. \nWe record estimates and prepare and file tax returns in various jurisdictions across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia based upon our interpretation of local tax laws and regulations. While we exercise significant judgment when applying complex tax laws and regulations in these various taxing jurisdictions, many of our tax returns are open to audit, and may be subject to future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. \nWe believe our estimates for the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits associated with uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements are appropriate based upon our assessment of the factors mentioned above. Given we do not record a valuation allowance on the majority of our U.S. deferred tax assets, we expect that our reported income tax expense (current plus deferred) for future periods will be higher than that recorded for prior periods.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\nWe recorded net income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $32.6 million and $597.6 million, respectively. On a per share basis, basic net income was $0.16 and diluted net income was $0.15 for the year ended December 31, 2024. On a per share basis, basic net income was $2.67 and diluted net income was $2.65 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n71\nTable of Contents\n \nRevenues\nFor the Year Ended,\nDecember 31, \n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nJAKAFI revenues, net\n$\n2,792.1 \n$\n2,593.7 \nOPZELURA revenues, net\n508.3 \n337.9 \nICLUSIG revenues, net\n114.3 \n111.6 \nPEMAZYRE revenues, net\n81.7 \n83.6 \nMINJUVI/MONJUVI revenues, net\n119.3 \n37.1 \nZYNYZ revenues, net\n3.2 \n1.3 \nTotal product revenues, net\n3,618.9 \n3,165.2 \nJAKAVI product royalty revenues\n418.8 \n367.6 \nOLUMIANT product royalty revenues\n135.6 \n136.1 \nTABRECTA product royalty revenues\n22.7 \n17.8 \nPEMAZYRE product royalty revenues\n2.2 \n1.9 \nTotal product royalty revenues\n579.3 \n523.4 \nMilestone and contract revenues\n43.0 \n7.0 \nTotal revenues\n$\n4,241.2 \n$\n3,695.6 \nThe increase in JAKAFI product revenues from 2023 to 2024 was comprised of a volume increase of $142.3 million and a price increase of $56.1 million. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in paid demand across all indications.\nThe increase in OPZELURA net product revenues from 2023 to 2024 was comprised of a volume increase of $165.3 million and a price increase of $5.1 million. The increase was driven by continued growth in new patient starts and refills, and approximately $60.7 million of OPZELURA net product revenues for 2024 were from Europe.  \nThe increase in MINJUVI/MONJUVI net product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior period was driven by the acquisition completed in February 2024, under which we gained exclusive global rights to tafasitamab marketed in the United States as MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix). Refer to Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition.\nOur product revenues may fluctuate from period to period due to our customers’ purchasing patterns over the course of a year, including as a result of increased inventory building by customers in advance of expected or announced price increases. Product revenues are recorded net of estimated product returns, pricing discounts including rebates offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and distribution fees and co-pay assistance. Our revenue recognition policies require estimates of the aforementioned sales allowances each period.\n72\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nDiscounts and \nDistribution\nFees\nGovernment\nRebates and\nChargebacks\nCo-Pay\nAssistance\nand Other\nDiscounts\nProduct\nReturns\nTotal\nBalance at January 1, 2024\n$\n20,479 \n$\n264,422 \n$\n13,016 \n$\n11,021 \n$\n308,938 \nAllowances for current period sales\n152,167 \n1,282,224 \n131,979 \n23,251 \n1,589,621 \nAllowances for prior period sales\n429 \n2,718 \n(68)\n4,386 \n7,465 \nCredits/payments for current period sales\n(129,777)\n(1,049,069)\n(127,400)\n(238)\n(1,306,484)\nCredits/payments for prior period sales\n(15,858)\n(117,737)\n(4,237)\n(15,407)\n(153,239)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n27,440 \n$\n382,558 \n$\n13,290 \n$\n23,013 \n$\n446,301 \nU.S. government rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our sales allowances. Increases in certain U.S. government reimbursement rates are limited to a measure of inflation, and when the price of a drug increases faster than this measure of inflation it will result \nin a penalty adjustment factor th\nat causes a larger sales allowance to those government related entities. We expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of our gross product sales will continue to increase in connection with any future product price increases greater than the rate of inflation, and any such increase in these government rebates and chargebacks will have a negative impact on our reported product revenues, net. We adjust our estimates for government rebates and chargebacks based on new information regarding actual rebates as it becomes available. \nWe brought a lawsuit against the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) alleging that a recent regulation issued by CMS on the definition of “line extension” for purposes of the Medicaid rebate program is too broad and has the unintended consequence of treating OPZELURA as a “line extension” of JAKAFI under this program. We believe that such a reading would violate CMS’s statutory authority and be arbitrary and capricious, given that OPZELURA, among other differentiators, is indicated to treat entirely different medical conditions and entirely different patient populations than JAKAFI. As of December 31, 2024, we have accrued approximately $127.6 million within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, relating to the incremental rebates that would be owed were OPZELURA considered a line extension of JAKAFI. The impact on OPZELURA gross to net deductions for the quarter ending December 31, 2024, is approximately 6.3%. If OPZELURA is not treated as a line extension of JAKAFI, this would result in a reversal of our accrual and a lower future gross to net deduction for OPZELURA.\nClaims by third-party payors for rebates and chargebacks are frequently submitted after the period in which the related sales occurred, which may result in adjustments to prior period accrual balances in the period in which the new information becomes available. Our company-sponsored patient savings program in which we provide financial assistance to enable commercially-insured patients to afford their insurance premium and co-pays may fluctuate as the commercial insurance landscape evolves and may impact net revenues, particularly for drugs like OPZELURA. We also adjust our allowance for product returns based on new information regarding actual returns as it becomes available.\nWe expect our sales allowances to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as changes in discount percentages, which are impacted by potential future price increases, rate of inflation, and other factors, such as changes to the 340B drug pricing program. In 2025, we expect to see a reduction in our sales allowances owed under Medicare Part D, due to changes from the Inflation Reduction Act, which effective January 1, 2025, replaced the manufacturer's coverage gap liability with a different discount structure.\nProduct royalty revenues on commercial sales of JAKAVI and TABRECTA by Novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by Novartis. Product royalty revenues on commercial sales of OLUMIANT by Lilly are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by Lilly. Product royalty revenues on commercial sales of PEMAZYRE by Innovent are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by Innovent. \n73\nTable of Contents\n \nOur milestone and contract revenues were $43.0 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our milestone and contract revenues were derived from a $25.0 million upfront payment received during the first quarter of 2024 upon our transfer of functional intellectual property to China Medical Systems Holdings Limited, and we recognized $18.0 million of upfront and milestone payments from two of our collaboration partners during the third quarter of 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, our milestone and contract revenues were primarily derived from a regulatory milestone under the Novartis collaboration and license agreement. \nCost of Product Revenues\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nProduct costs\n$\n129.0 \n$\n89.2 \nSalary and benefits related\n16.2 \n11.9 \nStock compensation\n2.3 \n3.1 \nRoyalty expense\n141.0 \n128.2 \nAmortization of definite-lived intangible assets\n23.6 \n22.6 \nTotal cost of product revenues\n$\n312.1 \n$\n255.0 \nCost of product revenues includes all product related costs, reserves for obsolescence, employee personnel costs, including stock compensation, for those employees dedicated to the production of our commercial products, royalties owed under our collaborative agreements and amortization of our licensed intellectual property rights for ICLUSIG and the amortization of capitalized milestone payments. The increase in cost of product revenues from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to growth in net product revenues, increased royalty expense and increased manufacturing related costs.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nSalary and benefits related\n$\n505.9 \n$\n399.1 \nStock compensation\n161.3 \n126.7 \nEscient acquisition related compensation expense\n11.3 \n— \nEscient IPR&D expense\n679.4 \n— \nClinical research and outside services\n1,074.7 \n936.7 \nOccupancy and all other costs\n174.2 \n165.1 \nTotal research and development expenses\n$\n2,606.8 \n$\n1,627.6 \nWe account for research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. Salary and benefits related expense increased from 2023 to 2024 due primarily to increased headcount to sustain our development pipeline. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. Additionally, as described in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as part of the Escient acquisition, we recognized compensation expense in research and development of $11.3 million associated with the accelerated vesting for certain Escient stock awards in connection with the acquisition on our consolidated statements of operations. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 also include the $679.4 million of expense related to the acquired in-process research and development assets as part of the Escient acquisition.  \n74\nTable of Contents\n \nThe increase in clinical research and outside services expense from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to continued investment in our late-stage development assets, additional expenses resulting from the Escient acquisition and timing of certain expenses. Research and development expenses include upfront and milestone expenses related to our collaborative agreements, which were $104.4 million and $36.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were net of $29.9 million and $49.1 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners.\nIn addition to one-time expenses resulting from upfront fees in connection with the entry into any new or amended collaboration agreements and payment of milestones under those agreements, research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre-clinical and clinical trial related activities. Many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including requests by regulatory agencies for more information, inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among patients, insufficient supplies for our clinical trials, timing of drug supply, including API, and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials. In addition, the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. These factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products.\n Selling, general and administrative expenses \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nSalary and benefits related\n$\n349.6 \n$\n300.1 \nStock compensation\n102.5 \n86.1 \nEscient acquisition related compensation expense\n20.2 \n— \nOther contract services and outside costs\n769.9 \n775.1 \nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n1,242.2 \n$\n1,161.3 \nSalary and benefits related expense increased from 2023 to 2024 due primarily to increased headcount. This increased headcount was due primarily to the establishment of our dermatology commercial organization. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. Additionally, as described in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as part of the Escient acquisition, we recognized compensation expense in selling, general and administrative expenses of $20.2 million associated with the accelerated vesting for certain Escient stock awards in connection with the acquisition on our consolidated statements of operations. \nLoss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration, which consists of our future royalty obligations to ARIAD/Takeda, was recorded on the acquisition date, June 1, 2016, at the estimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured quarterly. The change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was expense of $19.8 million and $29.2 million, respectively, which is recorded in loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration on the consolidated statements of operations. The loss on change in fair value of the contingent consideration during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was due primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impacting future revenue projections of ICLUSIG and the passage of time.\n75\nTable of Contents\n \nProfit sharing from co-commercialization activities\nUnder the former collaboration and license agreement with MorphoSys, which was executed in March 2020 and continued through February 5, 2024 as described further in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we and MorphoSys were both responsible for the commercialization efforts of tafasitamab in the United States and shared equally the profits and losses from the co-commercialization efforts. For the period from January 1, 2024 through February 5, 2024, our 50% share of the profits for tafasitamab was $1.0 million, as recorded in (profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements on the consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our 50% share of the costs for tafasitamab was $2.0 million, as recorded in (profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements on the consolidated statement of operations.\nUnder the collaboration agreement with Syndax, as described further in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we and Syndax are both responsible for the co-commercialization of axatilimab in the United States and share equally in the profits and losses from those efforts. We are the principal in the U.S. axatilimab co-commercialization efforts and will record 100% of all product revenues and associated costs in accordance with our profit sharing from co-commercialization activities accounting policy outlined in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no revenues from sales of axatilimab, however, there was $22.4 million of expense incurred in connection with the co-commercialization efforts, 50% of which is recorded as selling, marketing and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations.      \nNon-operating Income and Expenses\nInterest income\nInterest income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $128.7 million and $158.4 million, respectively. The decrease in Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily relates to a decrease in interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities generally due to lower cash equivalent and marketable securities balance in the second half of 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\nRealized and unrealized gain (loss) on equity investments \nRealized and unrealized gains and losses on equity investments will fluctuate from period to period, based on sales of securities and the change in fair value of the securities we hold in our publicly held collaboration partners. The following table provides a summary of those realized and unrealized gains and (losses): \nFor the Years Ended,\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nAgenus\n$\n(8.2)\n$\n(18.9)\nMerus\n106.1 \n45.2 \nMorphoSys\n30.7 \n22.9 \nSyndax\n(11.9)\n(5.5)\nOther\n(0.7)\n0.2 \nTotal realized and unrealized gain on equity investments\n$\n116.0 \n$\n43.9 \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold all remaining investments in Agenus Inc., Merus and MorphoSys AG as described further in in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $284.0 million and $236.6 million, respectively. \n76\nTable of Contents\n \nOur effective tax rate of 89.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased as compared to 28.4% for the prior year primarily due to non-deductible charges of $710.9 million associated with the Escient acquisition. Our effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible charges of $710.9 million associated with the Escient acquisition. Our effective tax rate for 2023 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign losses with no associated tax benefit and an increase in our valuation allowance against certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. This was partially offset by tax rate benefits associated with research and development and orphan drug tax credit generations and the foreign derived intangible income deduction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nDecember 31:\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n$\n2,158.1 \n$\n3,656.0 \nWorking capital\n$\n1,597.2 \n$\n3,405.0 \nYear ended December 31:\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n335.3 \n$\n496.5 \nInvesting activities\n$\n157.5 \n$\n(207.7)\nFinancing activities\n$\n(2,021.5)\n$\n(20.0)\nCapital expenditures (included in investing activities above)\n$\n(86.3)\n$\n(32.5)\nSources and Uses of Cash.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.2 billion. Our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts and U.S. government debt securities. Available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy’s primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments.\nCash provided by operating activities.\n The decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2023 to 2024 was due primarily to the Escient acquisition and changes in working capital.\nCash used in investing activities.\n Our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales of long term investments. During 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $157.5 million, which primarily represented sales of equity investments of $284.8 million and sale and maturity of marketable securities of $231.3 million, offset in part by purchases of marketable securities of $258.4 million, payments for intangible assets of $13.9 million, and capital expenditures of $86.3 million. During 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $207.7 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $456.0 million, capital expenditures of $32.5 million, payments for intangible assets of $15.0 million, and purchases of long term investments of $10.0 million, offset in part by the sale and maturity of marketable securities of $305.8 million.\nCash used in financing activities. \nDuring 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $2.0 billion and was primarily driven by expenditures associated with the share repurchase of $2.0 billion. During 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $20.0 million, consisting primarily of cash paid to ARIAD/Takeda for contingent consideration, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans net of tax withholdings.\nOur capital expenditures for construction activities and our non-operating contractual operating and finance lease obligations are discussed in Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n77\nTable of Contents\n \nIn August 2021, we entered into a $500.0 million, senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was subsequently amended in May 2023 and June 2024 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The June 2024 amendment to the Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from August 2024 to June 2027. We may increase the maximum revolving commitments or add one or more incremental term loan facilities, subject to obtaining commitments from any participating lenders and certain other conditions, in an amount not to exceed $250.0 million plus a contingent additional amount that is dependent on our pro forma consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. The Credit Agreement is described further in Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDue to the full utilization of our research and development and orphan drug tax credit carryforwards generated in prior years, our U.S. tax liabilities continue to reflect the adverse impacts of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses as required under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which eliminated the immediate expensing of such expenses.\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds available under our revolving credit facility, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; costs for future facility requirements; and expenditures for future strategic equity investments or potential acquisitions. We have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies or drug development candidates in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these licenses, we may be required to pay upfront fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products. These contingent future payments are discussed in detail in Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTo the extent we seek to augment our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations to satisfy our cash requirements for future acquisitions or other strategic purposes, we expect that additional funding can be obtained through equity or debt financings or from other sources. The sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock. Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness.",
