Based in Corona, California, Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating business, except through its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company’s subsidiaries primarily develop and market energy drinks. \nOverview\nWe develop, market, sell and distribute energy drink beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names:\n●\n     Monster Energy®\n●\n     Monster Energy Ultra®\n●\n     Rehab Monster®\n●\n     Monster Energy®Nitro\n●\n     Java Monster®\n●\n     Punch Monster®\n●\n     Juice Monster®\n●\n     Reign Total Body Fuel®\n●\n     Reign Inferno® Thermogenic Fuel\n●\n     Reign Storm®\n●\n     Bang Energy®\n●\n     NOS®\n●\n     Full Throttle®\n    \n●\n     Burn®\n●\n     Mother®\n●\n     Nalu®\n●\n     Ultra Energy®\n●\n     Play® and Power Play® (stylized)\n●\n     Relentless®\n●\n     BPM®\n●\n     BU®\n●\n     Samurai®\n●\n     Live+®\n●\n     Predator®\n●\n     Fury®\n​\nWe also develop, market, sell and distribute craft beers, flavored malt beverages (“FMBs”) and hard seltzers under a number of brands, including Jai Alai® IPA, Florida Man® IPA, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Wild Basin® Hard Seltzers, Dallas Blonde®, Deep Ellum\nTM\n IPA, Perrin Brewing Company® Black Ale, Hop Rising® Double IPA, Wasatch® Apricot Hefeweizen, The Beast\nTM\n, Nasty Beast® Hard Tea and a host of other brands.\nWe also develop, market, sell and distribute still and sparkling waters under the Monster Tour Water® brand name.\nIndustry Overview\nThe “alternative” beverage category combines non-carbonated, ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single-serve juices and fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks and single-serve still waters (flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with “new age” beverages, including sodas that are considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling beverages. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation, domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2024 for the “alternative” beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $74.2 billion, representing an increase of approximately 1.1% over estimated domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2023 of approximately $73.4 billion.\nReportable Segments\nWe have four operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment (“Monster Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks and Bang Energy® drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment (“Strategic Brands”), which is primarily comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”) in 2015 as well as our affordable energy brands, Predator® and Fury®, (iii) Alcohol Brands segment (“Alcohol Brands”), which is comprised of various craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers and (iv) Other segment (“Other”), which is comprised of certain products sold by American Fruits and Flavors LLC (“AFF”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”).\n3\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors (“bottlers/distributors”). In some cases, we sell ready-to-drink packaged drinks directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. \nOur Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling “concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold by such bottlers to other bottlers/distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers/distributors.\nGenerally, the Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating revenues, but lower per case gross profit margin percentages than the Strategic Brands segment.\nThe Company’s Alcohol Brands segment primarily generates operating revenues by selling kegged and ready-to-drink canned beers, FMBs and hard seltzers, primarily to beer distributors in the United States.\nGenerally, the Alcohol Brands segment has lower gross profit margin percentages than the Monster Energy® Drinks segment.\nFor certain risks with respect to our beverages see “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” below.\nCorporate History\nIn the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his sons started a business selling fresh non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles, California. In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a demand for shelf stable pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods, Inc. (“HFI”). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen’s Natural Soda® brand sodas. In 1990, California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (“CCC”) acquired certain assets of HFI, including the right to market the Hansen’s® brand name. In 1992, Hansen Natural Corporation acquired the Hansen’s® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC. Under our ownership, the Hansen’s® beverage business significantly expanded to include a wide range of beverages within the growing “alternative” beverage category including, in particular, energy drinks. In 2012, we changed our name from Hansen Natural Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In 2015, we acquired various energy brands from TCCC and disposed of our non-energy drink business. In 2016, we completed our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner AFF. In 2022, we completed our acquisition of Monster Brewing Company, which facilitated our entry into the alcohol beverage sector. In 2023, we completed our acquisition of the Bang Energy® drink business.\nTender Offer\nOn May 1, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to execute a modified “Dutch auction” tender offer to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. On May 8, 2024, the Company commenced the tender offer, with such offer expiring on June 5, 2024. On June 10, 2024, the Company accepted for purchase a total of approximately 56.6 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $53.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.0 billion. The repurchase was funded with approximately $2.25 billion of cash on hand and approximately $750 million in borrowings. The cost of these shares and the fees relating to the tender offer are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\n2024 Product Introductions\nDuring 2024, we continued to expand our existing energy drink portfolio by adding additional products to our portfolio in a number of countries and further developed our distribution markets.

We also began production at our facility in Norwalk, CA in January 2024. In addition, we manufacture Bang Energy® drinks and certain of our other energy drink products at our manufacturing facility in Phoenix, AZ. \nWe purchase flavor ingredients, flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, supplement ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our non-alcohol products from ingredient suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including supplement ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.\nFor our Strategic Brands segment, we primarily purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases from ingredient suppliers including TCCC, which are then sold to certain of our various third-party bottlers/distributors. The third-party bottlers/distributors are responsible for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products, including the procurement of all other required ingredients and packaging materials. \nFor certain limited products in the Strategic Brands segment, we may purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, supplement ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our Strategic Brand products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including supplement ingredients), for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/co-packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.\nFor our Alcohol Brands segment, we purchase cans, cartons, hops, malt, yeast, sugar, ethanol and other additives and flavorings and packaging materials from ingredient and raw material suppliers to be used in the brewing, fermentation, and packaging of alcohol beers, FMBs and hard seltzers. We are granted a right-of-use for any kegs used in production from a third-party supplier at a contracted rate per fill. Most of our alcohol finished goods are manufactured at our owned or leased manufacturing facilities or at third-party co-packers.\nCo-Packing Arrangements\nA majority of our non-alcohol and certain alcohol finished goods are manufactured by various third-party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our co-packaging arrangements vary in terms and, from time to time, we may enter into manufacturing contracts with agreed upon minimum quantities to ensure continuity of supply of certain products in certain territories.\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn some instances, subject to agreement, certain equipment may be purchased exclusively by us and/or jointly with our co-packers and installed at their facilities to enable them to produce certain of our products. In certain cases, such equipment remains our property and is required to be returned to us upon termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers, unless we are reimbursed by the co-packer at the then book value or via a per-case credit over a pre-determined number of cases that are produced at the facilities concerned.\nFor our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, we are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase and delivery to our third-party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our beverage products are packaged.\nOur products are packaged in a number of locations, both domestically and internationally. As distribution volumes increase in both our domestic and international markets, we will continue to source additional packing arrangements. \nOur ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, including in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, to a limited extent PET plastic bottles and caps, labels, flavor ingredients, flavors, juice concentrates, coffee, tea, supplement ingredients, ethanol, other ingredients and certain sweeteners, and/or procure adequate packing arrangements and/or obtain adequate or timely shipment of our products, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).\nFor certain of our products, there are limited co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment to package our products. We believe a short disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenues; however, as alternative co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products, either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all, a lengthy disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues. \nWe continue to actively seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities globally with adequate capacity and capability for the production of our various products to minimize transportation costs and transportation-related damages as well as to mitigate the risk of a disruption in production and/or importation.\nDistribution Agreements\nDuring 2024, we continued to expand distribution of our products in both our domestic and international markets.\nDistribution levels vary by product and geographic location. Net sales outside the United States were $2.96 billion, $2.71 billion and $2.36 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nMonster Energy\n®\n Distribution Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with various bottlers/distributors providing for the distribution of certain of our energy drinks during initial terms of up to twenty years, which may be extended thereafter, subject to certain terms and conditions, which may vary depending on the form of the agreement. Such agreements remain in effect for their then-current term as long as our products are being distributed, but are subject to specified termination rights held by each party, which may include by way of example, and depending on the form of agreement, termination upon: mutual agreement; material breach of the agreement by, or an insolvency of, either party; deadlock; change of control; changes in legal or regulatory conditions and termination of certain related agreements. Additionally, we are entitled to terminate certain distribution agreements at any time without cause upon payment of a termination fee, including a limited number of distribution agreements with TCCC network bottlers that were entered into prior to 2015.\nCertain of our material distribution arrangements for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, as amended from time to time, are described below:\n(a)\nAmended and Restated Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCC’s approval, territories in Canada and the United States in which bottlers from TCCC’s network of wholly or partially-owned and independent bottlers (the “TCCC North American Bottlers”) will distribute and sell, or continue to distribute and sell, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\n(b)\nAmended and Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries, or territories within countries, in which we wish to appoint TCCC network bottlers to distribute and sell our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, subject to TCCC’s approval. In February 2025, the Amended and Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC was renewed for an additional five-year term.\n(c)\nAdditionally, we have entered into distribution agreements for certain of our Monster Energy® products with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally.\nAll distribution territories in the United States, and substantially all distribution territories internationally have been transitioned to TCCC network bottlers/distributors. \nStrategic Brands Distribution Agreements\nWe have entered into distribution coordination agreements with TCCC pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCC’s approval, territories in which TCCC network bottlers will distribute our Strategic Brands energy drinks. We have entered into agreements with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally, providing for the distribution and sale of our Strategic Brands energy drinks.\nAlcohol Brands Distribution Agreements\nMonster Brewing Company has entered into agreements with various beer distributors, both in the United States and, to a limited extent, internationally, providing for the distribution of our alcohol products. Such agreements have varying terms and durations. Monster Brewing Company has also entered into distribution agreements with licensed beer distributors for the exclusive distribution of certain beverages in agreed upon territories. \nRaw Materials and Suppliers\nThe principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, to a limited extent PET plastic bottles and caps, kegs, cartons as well as flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, coffee, tea, hops, malt, yeast, ethanol, supplement ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations.\nAFF is the primary flavor supplier for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. We also purchase flavors from other suppliers as well as juices, supplement ingredients, glucose, sugar, sucralose, other sweeteners and other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.\nFor our Strategic Brands energy drinks, we purchase flavors, concentrates and/or beverage bases from flavor suppliers including TCCC in the United States and abroad, and may purchase certain other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.\nFor certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, Strategic Brands energy drinks and/or our alcohol drinks, these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor suppliers generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party customers.\nWe have entered into purchase agreements with key packaging and ingredient suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of such packaging and ingredients for the next one to four years based on current anticipated volume needs. Changes to those volume needs could result in shortages or excess supply of these contracted varieties. Many outside factors such as crop yield, weather, agricultural legislation, and the geopolitical climate could impact supply and price; however, we do source certain ingredients from different regions and suppliers to mitigate some of this risk.\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have identified alternative suppliers for many of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain flavor ingredients, flavors, fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea, dairy-based products, supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the future be, encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products.\nWe continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavor ingredients, flavors and concentrates purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as to negotiate arrangements with our existing suppliers, which would enable us to obtain access to certain of such concentrates or flavor formulas under certain circumstances. We have been partially successful in these endeavors. Additionally, in a limited number of cases, contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers, manufacturers and/or distributors.\nCompetition\nThe beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors as well as promotional and marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.\nImportant factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include brand and product image, taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting-edge products, ingredients, production processes, attractive and different packaging, brand exposure and marketing as well as pricing. We depend on our bottlers/distributors to prioritize our products, provide efficient, stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the “alternative,” energy, coffee, “functional,” “craft beer” and “beyond beer” (hard seltzers, FMBs, canned cocktails and other ready-to-drink beverages) beverage categories could cause our products to maintain or to lose market share, or we could experience price erosion, which could materially impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience competition from new entrants in the energy drink, energy shot, beer and beyond beer categories. For instance, a number of companies which market and distribute iced teas, coffees, juice cocktails, enhanced waters and sports drinks in various larger volume packages in glass and plastic bottles (including BODYARMOR, Vitamin Water, CORE, Arizona, Ocean Spray, Powerade, Prime and Starbucks), have added supplement ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as “functional” or energy beverages or as having “functional” benefits. We believe that many of those products contain lower levels of supplement ingredients, principally deliver refreshment and are positioned differently from our energy or “functional” drinks.\nWe are also subject to increasing levels of regulatory issues including in relation to the registration and/or taxation of our products in certain international markets, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. (See “Government Regulation” below for additional information).\nWe compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum marketing, sales efforts and attention from our multi-brand licensed bottlers and distributors, many of which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and brands. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases with products of much larger and in some cases better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”), Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (“KDP”) and Red Bull GmbH. From time to time, competitors have entered into distribution or acquisition agreements with certain other competitors. For example, last year, KDP, which distributes C4, entered into a long-term sales and distribution agreement with Black Rifle Coffee Company as well as a definitive agreement to acquire GHOST Lifestyle LLC and GHOST Beverages LLC.

We support our non-alcohol brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, sports personality endorsements, sampling and sponsorship of selected athletes, teams, series, bands, esports, causes and events. We utilize “push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. In-store posters, outdoor posters, social media, concerts, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. These strategies and activities may apply to our alcohol products where permitted by applicable laws.\nWe also manage taprooms and brewpubs adjacent to some of our manufacturing locations where we sell our alcohol products, merchandise, and food to consumers in a branded environment.\nWe believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned and refreshed from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which designs we continue to reevaluate from time to time.\nWhere appropriate, we partner with our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers to assist our marketing efforts.\nWe increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 11.9% in the twelve-months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023.\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCustomers\nOur non-alcohol customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. Our alcohol customers are primarily beer distributors who in turn sell to retailers within the alcohol distribution system. Percentages of our gross billings to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors’ sales to their own customers.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nU.S. full service bottlers/distributors\n \n46%\n​\n47%\n​\n48%\nInternational full service bottlers/distributors\n \n41%\n​\n40%\n​\n39%\nClub stores and e-commerce retailers\n \n8%\n​\n8%\n​\n9%\nRetail grocery, direct convenience, specialty chains and wholesalers\n \n2%\n​\n2%\n​\n2%\nAlcohol, value stores and other\n \n3%\n​\n3%\n​\n2%\n​\nOur non-alcohol customers include Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Limited, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, Inc., Reyes Holdings, LLC, Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages LLC, The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England, Inc., Swire Pacific Holdings, Inc.

Taylor Distributing and Admiral Beverage Corporation.\nA decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners accounted for approximately 14%, 13% and 13% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nCoca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately 10%, 10% and 11% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nReyes Holdings, LLC accounted for approximately 9% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nSeasonality\nSales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage industry is affected by weather conditions. However, the energy drink category appears to be less seasonal than traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets, particularly internationally, where temperature fluctuations may be more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of our finished products and increased or decreased advertising and promotional expenses.\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual Property\nWe presently have more than 21,400 registered trademarks and pending applications in various countries worldwide, and we apply for new trademarks on an ongoing basis. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and other intellectual property as very important to our business. We consider Monster®, Monster Energy®, \n ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the Beast!®, Rehab Monster®, Java Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster Energy® Nitro, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno®, Reign Storm®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, Predator®, Fury®, Live+®, BPM®, Samurai®, Bang Energy®, Monster Tour Water®, Oskar Blues Brewery®, Cigar City®, Deep Ellum Brewing Co®, Perrin Brewing Company®, Squatters®, Wasatch®, Jai Alai®, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Dallas Blonde®, Wild Basin®, Dale’s®, Hop Rising®, The Beast\nTM\n, The Beast Unleashed® and Nasty Beast® Hard Tea to be our core trademarks. We also own the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity. \nWe have registered Monster®, Monster Energy®, \n ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the Beast!®, Rehab Monster®, Java Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Play®, Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, Ultra Energy®, BPM®, Predator®, Fury®, Live+®, Samurai®, Reign®, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno®, Reign Storm®, Bang®, Bang Energy®, Monster Tour Water®, The Beast\nTM\n, The Beast Unleashed® and Nasty Beast® Hard Tea outside of the United States in certain jurisdictions.\nWe protect our trademarks by applying for registrations and registering our trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with government agencies in other countries around the world, particularly where our products are distributed and sold. We assert copyright ownership of the statements, graphics and content appearing on the packaging of our products and in our marketing materials. We aggressively pursue individuals and/or entities seeking to profit from the unauthorized use of our trademarks and copyrights, including, without limitation, wholesalers, street vendors, retailers, online auction site sellers, website operators and third parties. In addition to initiating civil actions against these individuals and entities, we work with law enforcement officials where appropriate.\nDepending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use.\nWe also enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or disparaging our trademarks by opposing registration of conflicting trademarks and initiating litigation as necessary.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to various U.S. regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”); the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health and safety; various environmental statutes; the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“California Proposition 65”); various state and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of alcohol beverages; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act) and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging, and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations.\nWe also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors – Changes in government regulation, or a failure to comply with existing regulations, related to energy drinks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,” “Regulations concerning our alcohol beverages may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and inhibit the sales of such products,” and “Significant changes to or failure to comply with various environmental laws may expose us to liability and/or cause certain of our facilities and/or those of our co-packers to close, relocate or operate at reduced production levels, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” below for additional information.\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, legislation and regulation may be introduced in the United States and other countries at the federal, state, provincial, municipal and supranational level in respect of each of the subject areas discussed below. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity and alcohol consumption, especially as they may affect children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened and alcohol beverages. There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages and we are seeing some attention to other ingredients in energy drinks. More generally, individuals in the recently inaugurated U.S. presidential administration have articulated significant concerns about ultra-processed foods, including sugar-sweetened beverages, and particular ingredients, as well as the “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) process for getting food ingredients to the market. Additionally, there are growing calls for the removal of such products from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly food stamps. In some territories, such as the European Union, food additives including sweeteners such as sucralose are subject to a safety re-evaluation which could potentially lead to changes in the specification for such additives or removal from the approved list of additives. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also recently initiated a process for post-market review of food ingredients.\nProduct Formulation, Labeling, Packaging, and Advertising.\n Globally, we are subject to a number of regulations applicable to the formulation, labeling, packaging, and advertising (including promotional campaigns) of our products. In California, we are subject to California Proposition 65, a law that requires that a specified warning be provided before exposing California consumers to any product that contains in excess of threshold amounts of a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. California Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to an average daily quantity of a listed substance that is below that threshold amount, which is determined either by scientific criteria set forth in applicable regulations or via a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established by the state, or the substance is naturally occurring, or is subject to another applicable exception. If we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold, it will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a warning would have an adverse impact on sales of our products in those locations or elsewhere. In addition, there has been increasing regulatory activity globally regarding constituents in packaging materials, including perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) and bisphenol A (“BPA”). Regardless of whether perceived health consequences of these constituents are justified, such regulatory activity could result in additional government regulations that impact the packaging of our beverages.\nIn addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products, including a requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. The FDA also recently published a proposed rule that, if finalized, would require certain front-of-pack nutrition labeling, including with respect to the level of added sugars in a product. Further, the U.S. Department of Agriculture promulgated regulations requiring that, as of January 1, 2022, the labels of certain bioengineered foods include a disclosure that the food is bioengineered. These regulations may impact, reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by consumers.\nOther countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, Hungary, Jordan, Poland, the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the member states of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), Mexico, the Central American Community, the People’s Republic of China, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and South Africa are also considering, or have enacted, new labeling requirements, which may require us to amend our labels and warning statements.\nMore generally, some markets, such as Tanzania, have specific energy drink standards that do not always allow for inclusion of certain ingredients, such as L-carnitine and ginseng, or that otherwise restrict the levels of certain ingredients in our products. In 2023, Peru challenged the use of L-carnitine in energy drinks. Other markets may also restrict or prohibit the use of ginseng and certain other botanicals in food. We may incur costs to address such country-specific requirements or face restrictions on our products.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAge and Other Restrictions on Energy Drink Products.\n Proposals to limit or restrict the sale and/or advertising of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age, and/or restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold, and/or to restrict the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) to purchase energy drinks have been raised and/or enacted in certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and/or in certain foreign countries. For example, the City of Lancaster, CA, passed an ordinance on January 14, 2025, making it an infraction to sell or otherwise distribute an energy drink to a person under 18 years of age. Bills seeking to impose an age restriction on the sale of energy drinks have also been introduced in the Connecticut, Massachusetts, and South Carolina legislatures. Outside of the United States, for example, Honduras, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Turkey, and Bahrain prohibit the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 18, and Armenia passed such a law in January 2025; Kazakhstan prohibits the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 21; Canada prohibits the promotion of energy drinks to children 12 years and under; Honduras, Latvia, Romania, and Scotland prohibit the sale of energy drinks in educational establishments; and Honduras and Turkey prohibit the sale or advertising of energy drinks at sports facilities, school cafeterias and hospitals. In Mexico, the States of Tabasco and Oaxaca prohibit the sale of energy drinks to minors and the consumption in schools; Colima prohibits the sale of energy drinks in private and public schools. Other Latin American countries such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Honduras and Uruguay have been considering age and other sales restrictions on energy drinks, as are other countries such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Spain, Hungary, and parts of the United Kingdom. Similar rules would not apply to coffee products that contain similar or higher levels of caffeine.\nExcise Taxes and Tariffs on Energy Drinks.\n Legislation that would impose an excise tax on sweetened beverages has been proposed in the U.S. Congress, in some state legislatures and by some local governments, with excise taxes generally ranging between $0.01 and $0.02 per ounce of sweetened beverage. Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction to pass such a measure, and a general tax of $0.01 per ounce on certain sweetened drinks, including energy drinks, became effective on January 1, 2015. Other U.S. jurisdictions (including Albany, Oakland and San Francisco, California; Boulder, Colorado; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, DC) have passed similar measures, some of which have been challenged in litigation. The imposition of such taxes on our products would increase the cost of certain of our products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make certain of our products less affordable. Excise taxes on sweetened beverages already are in effect in certain foreign countries where we do business, such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Mexico, Poland and Colombia. Slovakia recently established a tax on sweetened soft drinks, specifically targeting beverages containing caffeine from any source in excess of 150mg/l. Brazil recently approved a tax reform that includes the creation of a Selective Tax (IS) which may potentially impose additional taxes on energy drinks. Other countries are considering similar measures. In addition, legislation has been proposed in certain jurisdictions that would specifically impose excise taxes on energy drinks. For example, Kuwait is considering a proposal that would impose an excise tax on energy drinks. Such targeted legislation has been passed in other countries. For instance, on January 1, 2020, a reform to a Mexican excise tax went into effect that expanded the definition of an “energy drink” subject to this tax to include products with any amount of caffeine (the prior version of the tax required a threshold of 20mg of caffeine per 100 millimeters for the tax to be applicable) and “taurine or glucuronolactone or thiamine and/or any other substance that produces similar stimulating effects.” Hungary has instituted an excise tax to which our products are subject. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates began applying a selective tax of 100% on energy drinks in 2017, Qatar and Oman began applying the tax in 2019, and there are indications that a similar measure may be enacted in Kuwait.\nSeparately, geopolitical tensions and related trade disputes may affect our ability to operate or sell our products in certain jurisdictions. For example, the recently inaugurated U.S. presidential administration has proposed or implemented a range of new tariffs and trade restrictions affecting U.S. imports from China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and elsewhere, the nature and scope of which are difficult to predict. In response to such measures, U.S. trading partners have suggested they may impose, or have imposed, retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, and/or other trade or commercial restrictions on U.S. companies. The threat, implementation, or modification of new U.S. trade restrictions, as well as any retaliatory measures adopted by affected U.S. trading partners, could prove disruptive to the international market in which we operate and may lead to increased costs of raw materials and finished products.\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLimits on Caffeine Content.\n Legislation has been proposed to limit the amount of caffeine that may be contained in beverages, including energy drinks. Some jurisdictions where we do business have prescribed limits on caffeine content for beverages. For example, in Canada, the maximum amount of caffeine in a caffeinated energy drink cannot exceed 180mg per single-serving container or per serving (500 ml) in the case of a multi-serving container. We adjusted the caffeine levels in certain of our Monster Energy® products that are sold in Canada as caffeinated energy drinks to address these regulations, although the majority of our products were unaffected. In Europe, examples of caffeine restrictions include the Netherlands where there is a limit of 35mg/100ml, and Norway introduced, as of January 1, 2020, a limit of 32mg/100ml. Caffeine limit restrictions or restrictions on combining caffeine with other ingredients or in particular product sectors (such as performance beverages/sport drinks) have also been implemented or proposed in other jurisdictions, including Turkey, India, Pakistan’s Punjab region, Egypt, Colombia, Iraq, and the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Such restrictions could require reformulations of certain of our products. However, we may not be able to satisfactorily reformulate our products in all jurisdictions that adopt similar legislation.\nLimitations on Container Size.\n We package our products in a variety of different package types and sizes including, for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, aluminum cans larger than 16 fluid ounces. Certain jurisdictions, such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, and the Dominican Republic, have considered container size limitations on energy drinks and other beverages. If adopted, such limitations may require us to change the container size of our products sold in certain countries.\nCompliance with Alcohol-Related Regulation and Laws.\n Our Alcohol Brands segment is regulated by federal, state and local governments in both the U.S. and abroad whose laws and regulations govern the production, distribution and sale of alcohol beverages, including licensing, permitting, advertising and marketing. To operate our breweries, manufacturing facilities and other alcohol-related facilities, as well as to sell our alcohol products, we must obtain and maintain numerous approvals, licenses and permits from governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the FDA, state and local alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. Our breweries, in particular, are subject to audits and inspections by TTB and applicable state alcohol regulatory agencies at any time.\nOur alcohol beverages are also subject to various taxes, license fees, and the like levied by governmental entities as well as bonds that such entities may deem necessary to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. One such tax that we must comply with is the U.S. federal excise tax. Beginning in January 2018, the federal excise taxes imposed on domestic brewers that produce less than 2 million barrels annually were reduced from $7.00 to $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped annually. State and local excise taxes, on the other hand, vary based on the alcohol content and type of beverage. Federal, state, or local governments may increase such excise taxes in the future.\nCompliance with Environmental Laws. \nOur facilities and those of our co-packers in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, the use of water resources, waste disposal, and recycling. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar federal, state, local and supranational laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Changes in environmental compliance mandates, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance and future growth. In addition, continuing concern over environmental matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in and outside of the United States), including to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.\nContainer Deposits.\n Various municipalities, states and foreign countries require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary by jurisdiction. Other deposit, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship proposals have been, and may in the future be, introduced and enacted at the federal, state, and local levels, and in foreign countries.\nIn California, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other states and countries where our products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have employees in 83 countries, with a total of 6,558 employees working worldwide.

Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® Drinks segment. Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment represented 91.6% and 91.8% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Strategic Brands segment represented 5.8% and 5.3% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Alcohol Brands segment represented 2.3% and 2.6% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Other segment represented 0.3% of our net sales for both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nNet changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOur growth strategy includes further developing our domestic markets, expanding our international business and growing our business into new sectors, such as the alcohol beverage sector. Net sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $2.96 billion and $2.71 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such sales were approximately 40% and 38% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales to customers outside of the United States of approximately $247.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales to customers outside the United States, on a foreign currency adjusted basis, increased 18.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOur non-alcohol customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. Our alcohol customers are primarily beer distributors who in turn sell to retailers within the alcohol distribution system. Percentages of our gross billings to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below.

One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 159 countries and territories worldwide.\n●\nProfitable Growth\n – We believe “functional” value-added beverage brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, our Strategic Brands segment and our Alcohol Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.\n●\nCost Management\n – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on mitigating increases and/or reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.\n●\nEfficient Capital Structure\n – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.\nWe believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) reducing our expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. \nNet sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2025 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations”). \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of $2.54 billion compared to $4.43 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments related to treasury stock repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.93 billion as compared to $1.72 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Principal uses of cash flows in 2024 were purchases of treasury stock and purchases of real property, property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).\nOpportunities, Challenges and Risks\nLooking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant stockholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.” \n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy and alcohol drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy and/or alcohol drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine and/or alcohol content, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy and/or alcohol drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits, or alcohol drinks and their misuse or abuse, as well as articles indicating certain health risks of energy and alcohol drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. \nIn addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \nConsumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. \nIncreases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles as well as alcohol consumption continue to represent a challenge. \nWe recognize that obesity and alcohol abuse and misuse are complex and serious public health problems. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).\nOur historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative energy beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.\nIn addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to:\n●\nthe risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;\n●\nprofitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”);\n●\nchanges in consumer preferences and demand for our products;\n●\nthe emergence of new subcategories within the energy and/or alcohol beverage sectors that we fail (or are late) to successfully react to;\n●\neconomic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;\n●\nthe risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n●\nmaintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;\n●\nincreasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including obesity, caffeine and/or alcohol consumption and energy and/or alcohol drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns;\n●\ncosts of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;\n●\nthe risks associated with entering into new sectors in the beverage industry, in particular the alcohol beverage sector, and making acquisitions to implement our growth strategy;\n●\nincreases in costs of raw materials used by us;\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nrestrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients including flavors, flavor ingredients and supplement ingredients, due to port strikes and/or port congestion, delays due to natural disasters, pandemics, related labor issues or other importation impediments;\n●\nprotection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and our continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines;\n●\nlimitations on available quantities of aluminum cans, other packaging materials and ingredients;\n●\nlimitations on co-packing availability and in particular, consolidation in the co-packing industry; \n●\nincreases in ocean and domestic fuel and freight rates; and\n●\nthe imposition of additional regulations, including regulations restricting the sale of energy or alcohol drinks, limiting caffeine or alcohol content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions.\nSee “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.\nWe believe that the following opportunities exist for us:\n●\ndomestic and international growth potential of our products;\n●\ngrowth potential of the energy drink and alcohol beverage categories, both domestically and internationally;\n●\ngrowth potential of the affordable energy drink category;\n●\nplanned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;\n●\nthe introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;\n●\npackage, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;\n●\neffective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;\n●\nbroadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;\n●\nlaunching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and international markets and channels;\n●\ncontinued focus on reducing our cost base; and\n●\nour entry into the alcohol category and development of our alcohol portfolio.\nResults of Operations\nThis section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023.

We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales.\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $7.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $352.7 million, or 4.9% higher than net sales of $7.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net sales increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand as well as due to the Pricing Actions. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $247.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nNet sales were $2.77 billion and $2.53 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in EMEA, Asia Pacific (including Oceania), Latin America and the Caribbean. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales to customers in EMEA, Asia Pacific (including Oceania), Latin America and the Caribbean of approximately $245.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis in EMEA, Asia Pacific (including Oceania), Latin America and the Caribbean increased 19.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNet sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $6.86 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $309.5 million, or 4.7% higher than net sales of $6.56 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand as well as due to the Pricing Actions. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nNet sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $432.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $55.6 million, or 14.8% higher than net sales of $376.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Burn®, Predator®, NOS® and Fury® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $37.1 million for the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 24.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales of concentrates within the Strategic Brands segment tend to have more pronounced fluctuations from period to period as compared to net sales of our finished goods within the Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily as a result of bottler production schedules.\nNet sales for the Alcohol Brands segment were $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately $12.5 million, or 6.8% lower than net sales of $184.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to decreased sales by volume of craft beers.\nNet sales for the Other segment were $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 0.3% higher than net sales of $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nCase sales for our energy drink products, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 846.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately 77.4 million cases or 10.1% higher than case sales of 769.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2023. The overall average net sales per case for our energy drink products (excluding net sales of Alcohol Brands and Other segments) decreased to $8.62 for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was 4.4% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.01 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in overall average net sales per case for our energy drink products for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales as well as geographical/product sales mix.\nCase sales for our craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers in 192-ounce equivalents, were 12.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately 0.7 million cases or 5.0% lower than case sales of 13.1 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2023. Barrel sales for our craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers in 31 U.S. gallon equivalents, were 0.60 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately 0.03 million barrels or 5.0% lower than barrel sales of 0.64 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $4.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $254.7 million, or 6.7% higher than the gross profit of $3.79 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the increase in net sales.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 53.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily the result of the Pricing Actions, decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs\n, partially offset by production inefficiencies\n.\nOperating Expenses \nTotal operating expenses were $2.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $277.7 million, or 15.1% higher than total operating expenses of $1.84 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 included impairment charges of $138.8 million related to the Alcohol Brands segment (the “Alcohol Impairment Charges”). The Alcohol Impairment Charges were primarily the result of operating and financial performance not meeting projections due in part to challenges in the category, as well as a decrease in projected ongoing operating and financial performance. The Alcohol Impairment Charges relate primarily to goodwill and to certain other indefinite lived intangible assets as well as property and equipment.\nAdditionally, the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses of $110.0 million (primarily impairment charges related to the Alcohol Brands segment), increased selling and marketing expenses of $80.5 million (primarily sponsorships and endorsements), increased payroll expenses of $68.7 million and increased distribution expenses (including storage and warehouse) of $18.5 million. \nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 28.3% and 25.8%, respectively.\nOperating Income \nOperating income was $1.93 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately $23.1 million, or 1.2% lower than operating income of $1.95 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 27.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased primarily due to the Alcohol Impairment Charges partially offset by an increase in gross profit.\nOperating income was $536.3 million and $409.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for our operations in EMEA, Asia Pacific (including Oceania), Latin America and the Caribbean. \nOperating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $2.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $123.7 million, or 5.3% higher than operating income of $2.34 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of a $233.4 million increase in gross profit.\nOperating income for the Strategic Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $233.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $26.6 million, or 12.8% higher than operating income of $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in operating income for the Strategic Brands segment was primarily the result of a $35.5 million increase in gross profit.\nOperating loss for the Alcohol Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $200.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $119.2 million, or 146.9% higher than operating loss of $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in the operating loss for the Alcohol Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily the result of the Alcohol Impairment Charges.\nOperating income for the Other segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $1.1 million, or 30.4% higher than operating income of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily the result of the increase in gross profit.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest and other income (expense), net, was $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to interest and other income (expense), net, of $115.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were ($26.4) million and ($60.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income was $115.0 million and $130.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily related to lower short- and long-term investment balances as a result of treasury stock repurchases made during the year ended December 31, 2024. Interest expense was $27.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest and other income (expense), net included a gain on transaction of $45.4 million related to the acquisition of Bang Energy (“Bang Transaction Gain”) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Income Taxes \nProvision for income taxes was $480.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $42.9 million, or 9.8% higher than the provision for income taxes of $437.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate was 24.1% and 21.2% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stock-based compensation deduction for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nNet Income\nNet income was $1.51 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $121.9 million, or 7.5% lower than net income of $1.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the Alcohol Impairment Charges.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe use certain key metrics and financial measures not prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate and manage our business. For a further discussion of how we use key metrics and certain non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics” below.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics\nGross Billings**\nGross billings were $8.74 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $506.0 million, or 6.1% higher than gross billings of $8.23 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross billings of approximately $246.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Gross billings on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nGross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $8.04 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $452.1 million, or 6.0% higher than gross billings of $7.59 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand as well as due to the Pricing Actions. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $209.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nGross billings for the Strategic Brands segment were $490.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $65.5 million, or 15.4% higher than gross billings of $425.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Gross billings for the Strategic Brands segment increased primarily due to increased sales by volume of our Burn®, Predator®, NOS® and Fury® brand energy drinks. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross billings in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Gross billings for the Strategic Brands segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 24.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nGross billings for the Alcohol Brands segment were $176.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $11.8 million, or 6.3% lower than gross billings of $188.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in gross billings for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to decreased sales by volume of craft beers.\nGross billings for the Other segment were $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.7% higher than gross billings of $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPromotional allowances, commissions and other expenses, as described in the footnote below, were $1.28 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $153.2 million, or 13.6% higher than promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses of $1.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Promotional allowances as a percentage of gross billings were 14.7% and 13.7% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n**Gross billings represent amounts invoiced to customers net of cash discounts, returns and excise taxes. Gross billings are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evaluating overall Company performance. The use of gross billings allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross billings is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross billings may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.\nThe following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross billings with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n​\n    \n    \n​\n    \n    \n​\n    \n    \nPercentage\n    \nPercentage\n​\n(In thousands)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \nChange\n​\nChange\n​\n​\n \n2024\n \n2023\n \n2022\n \n24 vs. 23\n​\n23 vs. 22\n​\nGross Billings\n​\n$\n 8,735,661\n​\n$\n 8,229,709\n​\n$\n 7,261,639\n \n 6.1\n%\n 13.3\n%\nDeferred Revenue\n​\n​\n 39,935\n​\n​\n 39,955\n​\n​\n 39,969\n​\n (0.1)\n%\n (0.0)\n%\nLess: Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses***\n​\n \n (1,282,887)\n​\n \n (1,129,637)\n​\n \n (990,558)\n \n 13.6\n%\n 14.0\n%\nNet Sales\n​\n$\n 7,492,709\n​\n$\n 7,140,027\n​\n$\n 6,311,050\n \n 4.9\n%\n 13.1\n%\n​\n***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products primarily include consideration given to our non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs for our energy drink products with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for our energy drink products for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Promotional and other allowances for our Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted.\nSales\nThe table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past three years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.\nSales of our energy drinks are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us.\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. Beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. However, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. In addition, our continued growth internationally may further reduce the impact of seasonality on our business. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Inflation did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. Inflation had a negative impact on our results of operations, leading to increased cost of sales and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022. To mitigate the impact of inflation, we implemented the Pricing Actions\n.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents.\n As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.53 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Of our $1.53 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2024, $1.07 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nLong-term debt.\n In May 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other lenders, which provides for senior unsecured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.50 billion (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”). The Credit Facilities consist of a $750.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and up to $750.0 million in multicurrency revolving loan commitments (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Term Loan matures May 2027, and the Revolving Credit Facility matures May 2029. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities may be repaid at any time during the term of the Credit Facilities and, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, may be reborrowed prior to the maturity date. As of December 31, 2024, borrowings of $375.0 million remained outstanding on the Term Loan. As of February 27, 2025, borrowings of $225.0 million remained outstanding on the Term Loan. As of December 31, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility had remaining availability of $750.0 million.\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and access to credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development requirements, purchases of capital assets, purchases of equipment, purchases of real property and purchases of shares of our common stock, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be less than $500.0 million through December 31, 2025. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.\nPurchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property, plant and manufacturing equipment, and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n    \n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n​\n \n2024\n \n2023\n \n2022\nOperating activities\n​\n$\n 1,928,533\n​\n$\n 1,717,753\n​\n$\n 887,699\nInvesting activities\n​\n$\n 733,727\n​\n$\n (193,395)\n​\n$\n (161,367)\nFinancing activities\n​\n$\n (3,329,029)\n​\n$\n (542,599)\n​\n$\n (706,938)\n​\nCash flows provided by operating activities. \nCash provided by operating activities was $1.93 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $1.72 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $1.51 billion and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $127.1 million impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, $91.0 million of stock-based compensation, $80.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $13.5 million of non-cash lease expense and $8.2 million impairment of property and equipment.

GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nThe following summarizes our most significant critical accounting estimates:\nGoodwill\n – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2024, goodwill impairment charges of $86.3 million were recorded related to the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. Subsequent to the impairment charges recorded, there is no remaining goodwill for the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. As of December 31, 2024, the accumulated goodwill impairment balance was $86.3 million related entirely to the Alcohol Brands reporting unit. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no goodwill impairments recorded and there were no accumulated impairment balances.\nOther Intangibles\n – In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty methodology, which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues and terminal growth rates. A significant change in any or a combination of the assumptions used to estimate fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, impairment charges of $40.8 million and $38.7 million were recorded to intangibles primarily related to trademarks in our Alcohol Brands segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $2.2 million was recorded to intangibles.\nRevenue Recognition\n – Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales for our energy drink products primarily include consideration given to the Company’s non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:\n●\ndiscounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; \n●\nreimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; \n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nthe Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; \n●\nthe Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; \n●\nincentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; \n●\ndiscounted or free products; \n●\ncontractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and \n●\ncommissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of TCCC and/or to certain companies accounted for under the equity method by TCCC.\nThe Company’s promotional allowance programs for its energy drink products with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances for its energy drink products are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.\nPromotional and other allowances for the Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things.

See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.\nITE",
