See “Terminology” for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yield to manage our business on a day-to-day basis because they reflect revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. We also utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to \n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmanage our business on a day-to-day basis. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. \nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.\nIn addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. In 2025, we took on two newbuilds that have euro-denominated debt, that is primarily unhedged, and we expect to take delivery of ships that have euro-denominated debt in the future. Due to the significant increase in our euro-denominated debt in 2025 and the fact that a substantial portion of our debt is in dollars, we have included the related net foreign currency remeasurement losses as a supplemental adjustment in our calculation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS. To ensure comparability, we have retrospectively applied this adjustment to the corresponding periods in 2024, using a consistent methodology. The quantitative impact of these adjustments is presented in the accompanying reconciliation tables within this report. Non-GAAP diluted weighted-average shares are calculated using the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of restricted share units and options and the if-converted method to calculate the effect of convertible instruments. This is the same methodology that is used when calculating GAAP diluted weighted-average shares. However, the determination of whether the shares are dilutive or anti-dilutive is made independently on a GAAP and non-GAAP net income basis, and therefore, the number of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for GAAP and non-GAAP may be different. \nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “Results of Operations” section.\nFinancial Presentation  \nWe categorize revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities as either “passenger ticket” revenue or “onboard and other” revenue. Passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering, the size of the ship in operation, the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates. Our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises, which has historically been strongest during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. Passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations, meals in certain restaurants on the ship, certain onboard entertainment, government taxes, fees and port expenses and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us. Onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from casino, beverage sales, shore excursions, specialty dining, retail sales, spa \n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nservices and Wi-Fi services. Our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires, from which we receive a share of their revenue.\nOur cruise operating expense is classified as follows:\n●\nCommissions, transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with passenger ticket revenue. These costs include travel advisor commissions, air and land transportation expenses, related credit card fees, certain government taxes, fees and port expenses and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accommodations included as part of the overall cruise purchase price.\n●\nOnboard and other primarily consists of direct costs incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue, including casino, beverage sales and shore excursions.\n●\nPayroll and related consists of the cost of wages, benefits and logistics for shipboard employees and costs of certain inventory items, including food, for a third party that provides crew and other hotel services for certain ships. \n●\nFuel includes fuel costs, the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs.\n●\nFood consists of food costs for passengers and crew on certain ships.\n●\nOther consists of repairs and maintenance (including Dry-dock costs), ship insurance and other ship expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n​\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see “Critical Accounting Policies” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We have made no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n​\nFinancing Transactions\nIn January 2025, the full amount of outstanding borrowings under the Breakaway one loan, Breakaway two loan, Marina newbuild loan and Riviera newbuild loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was repaid with funds drawn from the Revolving Loan Facility, and the related collateral was also released. NCLC also issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2032. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to pay any related transaction premiums, fees and expenses. Concurrently, the Revolving Loan Facility was increased from $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion with the maturity date extended to 2030. \nIn April 2025, Holders exchanged $353.9 million of 2025 Exchangeable Notes for 2030 0.875% Exchangeable Notes and an aggregate Cash Payment of $64.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2025 Exchangeable Notes that were exchanged to, but excluding, the closing date of the Exchange. Additionally, in April 2025, the Company completed April Equity Offerings of 3,358,098 ordinary shares to the Holders at a price of $19.06 per share. The Company used the net proceeds from the April Equity Offerings, together with cash on hand, to make the Cash Payment. \nIn June 2025, NCLC amended the Seventh ARCA to increase the aggregate amount of the lenders’ commitments under the Revolving Loan Facility from $1.7 billion to approximately $2.5 billion. \nIn September 2025, NCLC issued approximately $1.4 billion of 2030 0.750% Exchangeable Notes, $1.2 billion of 2031 Notes, and $850.0 million of 2033 Notes. Additionally, in September 2025, the Company completed the September Equity Offering with certain institutional investors of 3,313,868 ordinary shares at a price of $24.53 per share. The net \n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nproceeds from these transactions, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) complete the Repurchases of a portion of the 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes and 2027 2.50% Exchangeable Notes, (ii) complete the Tender Offer or redeem all of the 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes and (iii) pay related accrued and unpaid interest, transaction premiums, fees and expenses. The collateral of the Revolving Loan Facility was also modified.\nSee Note 7 – “Long-Term Debt” for more information.\nUpdate on Bookings\nThe Company continues to experience healthy consumer demand across its portfolio of three brands for the balance of 2025 and into 2026, with strong demand for its Caribbean sailings. As a result, the Company remains well positioned within its optimal range for its forward 12-month booked position.\nStrategic Destination Investment\nWe announced a second phase of expansion plans for Great Stirrup Cay, the Company’s private island destination in the Bahamas, including a nearly six-acre Great Tides Waterpark expected to open in the summer of 2026. The addition of the nearly six-acre, 19-slide, Great Tides Waterpark which includes a 800-foot dynamic river and a 9,000-square-foot kids’ splash zone, along with other new amenities, will further enhance the guest experience at one of our most popular destinations. This is in addition to the previously announced two-ship pier, pool, family splash pad, welcome center and tram, which are expected to open by the end of 2025.\nStrategic Cost Optimization and Macroeconomic Trends \nOur strategic cost optimization efforts are driving a disciplined, company-wide focus on identifying efficiencies and optimizing costs across the organization. These initiatives are designed to deliver sustainable savings without compromising the guest experience or the quality of our offerings. Beyond the financial impact, this effort represents an evolution in our culture, embedding cost awareness, accountability, and continuous improvement into the way we operate.\nOur cost savings initiatives continue to deliver tangible results, which we believe position us well to cushion macroeconomic pressures. While there may be pressures on revenue, we believe these can be effectively offset by the continued execution of our cost optimization efforts. Our focus remains on managing the business for the long term, balancing disciplined pricing and cost control with guest experience and strategic investments for the future. However, global macroeconomic events have created volatility and disruptions in the past that have adversely impacted our Company, and they may do so again in the future. Furthermore, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for certain portions of ship construction contracts, euro-denominated debt and various exchange rates for customer deposits that have not been hedged. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” below for additional information.\nClimate Change\nWe believe the increasing focus on climate change, including the Company’s targets for greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reductions, and evolving regulatory requirements will materially impact our future capital expenditures and results of operations. We have set interim targets to guide us on our path to net zero GHG emissions and provide more details about such targets in our annual Sail & Sustain Report (which does not constitute a part of, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into, this report). We expect to incur significant expenses related to these regulatory requirements and commitments, which have and will include expenses related to GHG emissions reduction initiatives, including modifications to our ships, and have and will include the purchase of emissions allowances and alternative fuels, among other things. We have changed and may continue to be required to change certain operating procedures, for example slowing the speed of our ships, to meet regulatory requirements, which could adversely impact our operations. We are also evaluating the effects of global climate change-related requirements, which are still evolving, including our ability to mitigate certain future expenses through initiatives to reduce GHG emissions; consequently, the full impact to the Company is not yet known. Additionally, our ships, port facilities, corporate offices and island destinations have in \n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthe past and may again be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. For example, certain ports have become temporarily unavailable to us due to hurricane damage and other destinations have either considered or implemented restrictions on cruise operations due to environmental concerns. Refer to “Impacts related to climate change may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nQuarterly Overview\nThree months ended September 30, 2025 (“2025”) compared to three months ended September 30, 2024 (“2024”)\n●\nTotal revenue increased 4.7% to $2.9 billion compared to $2.8 billion.\n●\nNet income and diluted EPS were $419.3 million and $0.86, respectively, compared to $474.9 million and $0.95, respectively.\n●\nOperating income was $749.4 million compared to $691.2 million. \n●\nGross margin increased 8.4% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion.

months ended September 30, 2025 (“2025”) compared to three months ended September 30, 2024 (“2024”)\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased to $2.9 billion in 2025 compared to $2.8 billion in 2024 primarily due to an increase in Capacity Days related to the delivery of Norwegian Aqua in March 2025 and Oceania Allura in July 2025. \nExpense\nTotal cruise operating expense increased 1.0% primarily due to the delivery of Norwegian Aqua in March 2025 and Oceania Allura in July 2025 offset primarily by a reduction in air costs largely due to changes in itinerary mix. Total other operating expense increased 10.0% in 2025 compared to 2024 primarily related to an increase in marketing, general and administrative expense from higher advertising and promotions.\n​\nInterest expense, net was $328.8 million in 2025 compared to $175.2 million in 2024. The change in interest expense reflects losses in 2025 from extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs, which were $154.5 million. Excluding these losses, the impact from an increase in debt in 2025 was offset by a reduction in average rates.\nOther income (expense), net was income of $13.0 million in 2025 compared to expense of $34.1 million in 2024. The income and expense primarily related to net gains and losses from foreign currency remeasurements.\n​\nNine months ended September 30, 2025 (“2025”) compared to nine months ended September 30, 2024 (“2024”)\nRevenue\nTotal revenue was $7.6 billion in 2025 and $7.4 billion in 2024. The increase in Capacity Days related to the delivery of Norwegian Aqua in March 2025 and Oceania Allura in July 2025 was offset by an increased number of Berths in Dry-dock in 2025 as larger ships were in Dry-dock.\nExpense\nTotal cruise operating expense decreased 1.5% primarily related to a reduction in air costs largely due to changes in itinerary mix and fuel cost offset by the delivery of Norwegian Aqua in March 2025 and Oceania Allura in July 2025. Total other operating expense increased 8.9% in 2025 compared to 2024 primarily related to an increase in marketing, general and administrative expense from higher advertising and promotions.\n​\nInterest expense, net was $783.5 million in 2025 compared to $571.9 million in 2024. The change in interest expense reflects higher losses in 2025 from extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs, which were $272.5 million in 2025 compared to $29.2 million in 2024. Excluding these losses, interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower average rates, partially offset by higher debt outstanding in connection with the delivery of ships.\nOther income (expense), net was expense of $167.9 million in 2025 compared to $14.1 million in 2024. The expense primarily related to net gains and losses from foreign currency remeasurements. \n​\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of September 30, 2025, our liquidity was approximately $1.8 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $166.8 million and $1.6 billion available under our Revolving Loan Facility. Our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. \n​\nIn January 2025, the full amount of outstanding borrowings under the Breakaway one loan, Breakaway two loan, Marina newbuild loan and Riviera newbuild loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was repaid with funds drawn \n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfrom the Revolving Loan Facility, and the related collateral was also released. NCLC also issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2032. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to pay any related transaction premiums, fees and expenses. Concurrently, the Revolving Loan Facility was increased from $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion with the maturity date extended to 2030. \n​\nIn April 2025, Holders exchanged $353.9 million of 2025 Exchangeable Notes for 2030 0.875% Exchangeable Notes and an aggregate Cash Payment of $64.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2025 Exchangeable Notes that were exchanged to, but excluding, the closing date of the Exchange. Additionally, in April 2025, the Company completed April Equity Offerings of 3,358,098 ordinary shares to the Holders at a price of $19.06 per share. The Company used the net proceeds from the April Equity Offerings, together with cash on hand, to make the Cash Payment. \n​\nIn June 2025, NCLC amended the Seventh ARCA to increase the aggregate amount of the lenders’ commitments under the Revolving Loan Facility from $1.7 billion to approximately $2.5 billion. \n​\nIn September 2025, NCLC issued approximately $1.4 billion of 2030 0.750% Exchangeable Notes, $1.2 billion of 2031 Notes, and $850.0 million of 2033 Notes. Additionally, in September 2025, the Company completed the September Equity Offering with certain institutional investors of 3,313,868 ordinary shares at a price of $24.53 per share. The net proceeds from these transactions, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) complete the Repurchases of a portion of the 2027 1.125% Exchangeable Notes and 2027 2.50% Exchangeable Notes, (ii) complete the Tender Offer or redeem all of the 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes and (iii) pay related accrued and unpaid interest, transaction premiums, fees and expenses. The collateral of the Revolving Loan Facility was also modified.\n​\nSee Note 7 – “Long-Term Debt” for further details about the above financing transactions.\n​\nBased on our liquidity estimates and our current resources, we have concluded we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that the accuracy of the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the dynamic nature of the current operating environment, including any current macroeconomic events and conditions such as inflation, tariff increases and trade wars, rising fuel prices and higher interest rates. Within the next twelve months, we may optimize our liquidity or pursue other refinancings in order to reduce interest expense and/or extend debt maturities. There is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations. Beyond the next 12 months, we will pursue refinancings and other balance sheet optimization transactions in order to reduce interest expense and/or extend debt maturities. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ from our expectations.\n​\nAs of September 30, \n2025, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. If we do not continue to remain in compliance with our covenants, we would have to seek additional amendments to or waivers of the covenants. However, no assurances can be made that such amendments or waivers would be approved by our lenders.  Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default and/or cross acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and liquidity.\n​\nOur Moody’s long-term issuer rating is B1 and our senior unsecured rating is B3. Our S&P Global issuer credit rating is B+, our issue-level rating on our Revolving Loan Facility is BB and our senior unsecured rating is B+. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as has occurred in the past, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be negatively impacted. We also have capacity to incur additional indebtedness under our debt agreements and may issue additional ordinary shares from time to time, subject to our authorized number of ordinary shares. However, there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.\n​\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had advance ticket sales of $3.3 billion, including the long-term portion. We also have agreements with our credit card processors that, as of September 30, 2025, governed approximately $2.9 billion in advance ticket sales that had been received by the Company relating to future voyages. These agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances, including the existence of a material adverse change, excessive chargebacks and other triggering events, that the Company maintain a reserve which would be satisfied by posting collateral. Although the agreements vary, these requirements may generally be satisfied either through a percentage of customer payments withheld or providing cash funds directly to the card processor. Any cash reserve or collateral requested could be increased or decreased. We may be required to pledge additional collateral and/or post additional cash reserves or take other actions in the future that may adversely affect our liquidity.\n​\nSources and Uses of Cash\nIn this section, references to “2025” refer to the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and references to “2024” refer to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion in 2025 and $1.7 billion in 2024. The net cash provided by operating activities included net income and timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities. Advance ticket sales increased by $13.9 million in 2025 and by $90.9 million in 2024. \nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.8 billion in 2025 and $985.7 million in 2024. The net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the delivery of Norwegian Aqua and Oceania Allura in 2025. The net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to newbuild payments and ship improvements in 2024.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 billion in 2025 primarily due to newbuild loans related to the delivery of Norwegian Aqua and Oceania Allura, net receipts from our Revolving Loan Facility and the impact of various note refinancings. Net cash used in financing activities was $734.8 million in 2024 primarily due to repayments of newbuild loans, our 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028 and a portion of the 3.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024 partially offset by the proceeds from newbuild loan facilities and the 6.250% senior unsecured notes due 2030.\nFuture Capital Commitments \nFuture capital commitments consist of contracted commitments, including ship construction contracts. Anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts and growth, which includes private island developments and enhancements and other strategic growth initiatives, were $0.4 billion for the remainder of 2025 and $2.7 billion for the years ending December 31, 2026 and 2027. The Company has export credit financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of $49.5 million for the remainder of 2025 and $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ending December 31, 2026 and 2027, respectively. Anticipated other non-newbuild capital expenditures for the remainder of 2025 are approximately $0.1 billion. Future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense. \n​\n​\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNewbuilds\n​\nThe following chart discloses details about our newbuild program. The impacts of initiatives to improve environmental sustainability and modifications that NCLH plans to make to its newbuilds to improve their profitability and better space out the newbuilds, along with shipyard availability, have resulted in us resetting the delivery dates of certain expected ship deliveries. These and other impacts could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged. Expected delivery dates for our most recently announced newbuilds are preliminary and subject to change.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nYear\nBrand\nClass\nShip Name\nGross Tons\n(1)\nBerths\n(1)\nStatus\n2026\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nPrima Class\nNorwegian Luna\n~156,000\n~3,565\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2026\nRegent Seven Seas Cruises\nPrestige Class\nSeven Seas Prestige\n~77,000\n~822\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2027\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNext Gen \"Methanol-Ready\n(2)\n\"\n \nPrima Class\nTo come\n~169,000\n~3,840\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2027\nOceania Cruises\nSonata Class\nOceania Sonata\n~86,000\n~1,390\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2028\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNext Gen \"Methanol-Ready\n(2)\n\"\n \nPrima Class\nTo come\n~169,000\n~3,840\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2029\nOceania Cruises\nSonata Class\nOceania Arietta\n~86,000\n~1,390\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2030\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNew Class\nTo come\n~227,000\n~5,000\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2030\nRegent Seven Seas Cruises\nPrestige Class\nTo come\n~77,000\n~822\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2032\nOceania Cruises\nSonata Class\nTo come\n~86,000\n~1,390\nContract effective, but not yet financed. \n2032\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNew Class\nTo come\n~227,000\n~5,000\nContract effective / financed\n(3)\n2034\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNew Class\nTo come\n~227,000\n~5,000\nContract effective / financing is being negotiated.\n2035\nOceania Cruises\nSonata Class\nTo come\n~86,000\n~1,390\nContract effective, but not yet financed. \n2036\nNorwegian Cruise Line\nNew Class\nTo come\n~227,000\n~5,000\nContract effective / financing is being negotiated.\n(1)\nBerths and gross tons are preliminary and subject to change as we approach delivery.\n(2)\nDesigns for the final two Prima Class ships have been lengthened and reconfigured to accommodate the use of green methanol as a future fuel source. Additional modifications will be needed to fully enable the use of green methanol.\n(3)\nWe have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship as well as related financing premiums, subject to certain conditions.\n​\nThe combined contract prices, including amendments and change orders, of the 13 ships on order for delivery was approximately €18.4 billion, or $21.6 billion based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of September 30, 2025. We do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur. However, if any such events were to occur, it could result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCapitalized interest for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $21.6 million and $17.2 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $65.5 million and $40.5 million, respectively, primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of September 30, 2025, our material cash requirements for debt and ship construction were as follows (in thousands): \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nRemainder of\n    \n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2025\n    \n2026\n    \n2027\n    \n2028\n    \n2029\n    \n2030\n    \nThereafter\n    \nTotal\nLong-term debt (1)\n​\n$\n 306,131\n​\n$\n 1,461,396\n​\n$\n 1,589,060\n​\n$\n 1,783,209\n​\n$\n 1,747,516\n​\n$\n 3,904,985\n​\n$\n 7,299,683\n​\n$\n 18,091,980\nShip construction contracts (2)\n​\n \n 161,281\n​\n​\n 2,360,781\n​\n​\n 2,471,917\n​\n​\n 1,509,721\n​\n​\n 1,320,504\n​\n​\n 3,335,466\n​\n​\n 9,455,741\n​\n \n 20,615,411\nTotal\n​\n$\n 467,412\n​\n$\n 3,822,177\n​\n$\n 4,060,977\n​\n$\n 3,292,930\n​\n$\n 3,068,020\n​\n$\n 7,240,451\n​\n$\n 16,755,424\n​\n$\n 38,707,391\n(1)\nIncludes principal as well as estimated interest payments with Term SOFR held constant as of September 30, 2025. Includes exchangeable notes, portions of which can be settled in NCLH ordinary shares. Excludes the impact of any future possible refinancings and undrawn export-credit backed facilities. \n(2)\nShip construction contracts are for our newbuild ships based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of September 30, 2025. We currently have committed undrawn export-credit backed facilities of approximately $12.3 billion which funds approximately 80% of our ship construction contracts, with the exception of the two Sonata Class Ships on order for Oceania Cruises with currently scheduled delivery in 2032 and 2035 and the two additional ships on order for Norwegian Cruise Line with currently scheduled delivery in 2034 and 2036. \n​\nFunding Sources\nCertain of our debt agreements contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital ratio and maintain certain other ratios. The net book value of our ships pledged as collateral for certain of our debt is approximately $14 billion. We believe we were in compliance with our covenants as of September 30, 2025.\nIn addition, our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of our subsidiaries, including NCLC, to make distributions and/or pay dividends to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. NCLH is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to it to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. However, we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations.\nWe believe our cash on hand, borrowings available under the Revolving Loan Facility, expected future operating cash inflows and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities will be sufficient to fund operations, debt payment requirements and capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12-month period. Refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—General” for further information regarding liquidity. \nOther\nCertain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business. The amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions. We refer you to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—General” for information regarding collateral that may be provided to our credit card processors.\nAs a routine part of our business, depending on market conditions, exchange rates, pricing and our strategy for growth, we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships, acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these transactions were to occur, they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness, through cash flows from operations, or through the issuance of debt, equity or equity-related securities. \n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, we consider opportunities for the sale of ships and long-term charters with purchase options. For example, the Company recently executed long-term charter agreements, each inclusive of purchase options, for Norwegian Sky beginning in 2026 and Norwegian Sun beginning in 2027. We are currently contemplating additional long-term charters with a purchase option for a nominal value at the end of the lease period. These types of agreements are being pursued as part of our ship disposal strategy for certain older vessels in our fleet.\n​"
