Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\nThe following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both MAA and the Operating Partnership, of which MAA is the sole general partner and in which MAA owned a 97.4% interest as of December 31, 2024. MAA conducts all of its business through the Operating Partnership and its various subsidiaries.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance and achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nMAA, an S&P 500 company, is a multifamily-focused, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. We own, operate, acquire and selectively develop apartment communities primarily located in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. As of December 31, 2024, we owned and operated 293 apartment communities (which does not include development communities under construction) through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, and had an ownership interest in one apartment community through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had seven development communities under construction, and 35 of our apartment communities included retail components. Our apartment communities, including development communities under construction, were located across 16 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\nWe report in two segments, Same Store and Non-Same Store and Other. Our Same Store segment represents those apartment communities that have been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months as of the first day of the calendar year. Communities are considered stabilized when achieving 90% average physical occupancy for 90 days. Our Non-Same Store and Other segment includes recently acquired communities, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities that have been disposed of or identified for disposition, communities that have incurred a significant casualty loss and stabilized communities that do not meet the requirements to be Same Store communities. Also included in our Non-Same Store and Other segment are non-multifamily activities and expenses related to severe weather events, including hurricanes and winter storms.  Additional information regarding the composition of our segments is included in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, net income available for MAA common shareholders was $523.9 million as compared to $549.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Results for the year ended December 31, 2024 included $55.0 million of gain related to the sale of depreciable real estate assets, $11.2 million of gain on the consolidation of a third-party development, $9.3 million in net casualty gain and $6.1 million of non-cash gain, net of tax, from investments, partially offset by $18.8 million of non-cash loss related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares and $9.4 million of legal costs and settlements. Results for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $18.5 million of non-cash gain related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares and $3.5 million of non-cash gain, net of tax, from investments. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 2.0% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by a 44.7% increase in our Non-Same Store and Other segment. Property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by 6.8% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by a 3.9% increase in our Same Store segment and 71.8% increase in our Non-Same Store and Other segment. The primary drivers of these changes are discussed in the “Results of Operations” section.\n\n\nTrends\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue growth for our Same Store segment continued to be primarily driven by growth in average effective rent per unit. The average effective rent per unit for our Same Store segment increased to an average effective rent per unit of $1,688 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $1,684 for the year ended December 31, 2023. This represents an increase of 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts, after the effect of leasing concessions, for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, average physical occupancy for our Same Store segment was 95.5%, as compared to 95.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents, and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, resident turnover for our Same Store segment was 42.0% as compared to 44.9% as of December 31, 2023. Resident turnover represents resident move outs, excluding transfers within the Same Store segment, as a percentage of expiring leases on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of the reported period.\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAn important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We have multifamily assets in 39 defined markets, with a presence in approximately 150 submarkets and a mixture of garden-style, mid-rise and high-rise communities. This diversity helps to mitigate exposure to economic issues, including supply and demand factors, in any one geographic market or area. We believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both urban and suburban locations, with a broad range of monthly rent price points, will provide higher performance and lower volatility throughout the full economic cycle.\n\n\nDemand for apartments in our markets was strong during 2024, which contributed to the steady absorption of the record-level volume of new supply delivered during the year, which we believe has now peaked. The strong demand resulted in record low resident turnover, steady occupancy and strong renewal pricing and collections. We believe demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth, population growth, household formation and in-migration over the long term. We continue to monitor pressures surrounding housing supply, inflation trends and general economic conditions. A worsening of the current environment could contribute to uncertain rent collections going forward, suppress demand for apartments and could drive lower rent pricing on new leases and renewals than what we achieved in the year ended December 31, 2024. We believe that in calendar year 2025 we will see continued decline in the amount of new apartment deliveries impacting our portfolio and we will enter a new multi-year cycle with demand outpacing supply.\n\n\nAccess to the financial markets remains available for high-credit rated borrowers, such as ourselves. Overall borrowing costs remain at elevated levels and we expect this trend to continue. As of December 31, 2024, we had $250.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our commercial paper program. Our continued exposure to elevated interest rates will be a result of additional variable rate borrowings or future financing and refinancing activities.\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we achieved net income available for MAA common shareholders of $523.9 million, a 4.6% decrease as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and total revenue growth of $42.5 million, representing a 2.0% increase in property revenues as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion describes the primary drivers of the decrease in net income available for MAA common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. A discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is found in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov and on our website at https://www.maac.com, on the “For Investors” page under “Filings and Financials—Annual Reports.”\n \n\n\nProperty Revenues\n\n\nThe following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIncrease\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Increase\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame Store\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,084,836\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,075,096\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,740\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Same Store and Other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n106,179\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n73,372\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32,807\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,191,015\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,148,468\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n42,547\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increase in property revenues for our Non-Same Store and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth.  The Same Store segment generated a 0.5% increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily the result of average effective rent per unit growth of 0.3% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in property revenues from the Non-Same Store and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of increased revenues from completed development communities and recently acquired communities.\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProperty Operating Expenses\n\n\nProperty operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, landscaping and other operating expenses.

The increase in property operating expenses from the Non-Same Store and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of increased expenses from completed development communities and recently acquired communities.\n \n\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $585.6 million, an increase of $20.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.  The increase was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our completed development communities and capital spend activities made in the normal course of business during the year ended December 31, 2024, partially offset from decreased depreciation expense from disposed communities during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\nOther Income and Expenses\n\n\nProperty management expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $72.0 million, an increase of $4.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $56.5 million, a decrease of $2.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $168.5 million, an increase of $19.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in our average outstanding debt balance and an increase of 25\n \nbasis points in our effective interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\n \n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we disposed of two apartment communities, resulting in a gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets of $55.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not dispose of any apartment communities. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not dispose of any land parcels. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we disposed of one land parcel, resulting in the recognition of a negligible gain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets.\n \n\n\nOther non-operating (income) expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1.7 million of income, as compared to $31.2 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2023. The income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by $11.2 million of gain on the consolidation of a third-party development, $9.3 million of net casualty related recoveries, $7.8 million of non-cash gain from investments and miscellaneous income of $1.0 million, partially offset by $18.8 million of non-cash loss related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares and $9.4 million of legal costs and settlements. The income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by $18.5 million of non-cash gain related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, $4.4 million of non-cash gain from investments, $5.5 million of miscellaneous income and $3.4 million of interest income, partially offset by $1.0 million in net casualty loss.\n \n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\n\n\nFunds from operations, or FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment and gain on consolidation of third-party development, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, FFO, when used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, represents FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders.\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for MAA common shareholders or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Management believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets and gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. While our calculation of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’, or NAREIT’s, definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\n\n\nCore FFO represents FFO as adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core business operations, such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares; gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets; gain or loss on investments, net of tax; casualty related charges (recoveries), net; gain or loss on debt extinguishment; legal costs, settlements and (recoveries), net; and mark-to-market debt adjustments. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back to FFO, Core FFO, when used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, represents Core FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for MAA common shareholders, or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Management believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance from rental activities. While our definition of Core FFO may be similar to others in the industry, our methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\n\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for MAA common shareholders to FFO and Core FFO for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, as we believe net income available for MAA common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income available for MAA common shareholders\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n523,855\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n549,118\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n579,927\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n558,969\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gain) loss on sale of depreciable real estate assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(55,003\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAA’s share of depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n   of real estate joint venture\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n628\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n615\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on consolidation of third-party development \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(11,239\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,033\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15,025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,052,201\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,123,789\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss (gain) on embedded derivative in preferred shares \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18,751\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(18,528\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(54\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on investments, net of tax \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(6,078\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3,531\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasualty related (recoveries) charges, net \n(1)(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(9,326\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n980\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on debt extinguishment \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(57\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal costs, settlements and (recoveries), net \n(1)(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,437\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(4,454\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark-to-market debt adjustment \n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(25\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,064,985\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,098,120\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nIncluded in “Other non-operating (income) expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\n\n(2)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, gain on investments is presented net of tax expense of $1.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively.  \n\n\n(3)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, in accordance with our accounting policies, we recognized $8.0 million of accrued legal defense costs that are expected to be incurred through July 2027.\n\n\n(4)\nIncluded in “Interest expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n\nCore FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $33.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, of $52.0 million, interest expense of $19.3 million and property management expenses of $4.3 million, partially offset by an increase in property revenues of $42.5 million.\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Debt, EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre\n\n\nNet debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents unsecured notes payable and secured notes payable less cash and cash equivalents and 1031(b) exchange proceeds included in restricted cash.

As an owner and operator of real estate, management considers EBITDA to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA excludes various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance.

While our definition of EBITDA\nre\n is in accordance with NAREIT’s definition, it may differ from the methodology utilized by other REITs to calculate EBITDA\nre\n and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. EBITDA\nre\n should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity.\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\nre\n is comprised of EBITDA\nre\n further adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares; gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets; gain or loss on investments; casualty related charges (recoveries), net; gain or loss on debt extinguishment; and legal costs, settlements and (recoveries), net. As an owner and operator of real estate, management considers Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n to be an important measure of performance from core operations because Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n excludes various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n may differ from the methodology utilized by other REITs to calculate Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n. Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity.\n\n\nManagement monitors its debt levels to a ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. We believe this is an important factor in the management of our debt levels to maintain an optimal capital structure, and it is also considered in the assignment of our credit ratings. Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is measured on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n \n\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of unsecured notes payable and secured notes payable to net debt as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as we believe unsecured notes payable and secured notes payable, combined, is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsecured notes payable\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,620,690\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,180,084\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecured notes payable\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n360,267\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n360,141\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal debt\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,980,957\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,540,225\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(43,018\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(41,314\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet debt\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,937,939\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,498,911\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, as we believe net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n541,576\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n567,831\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n585,616\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n565,063\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n168,544\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n149,234\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,240\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,744\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEBITDA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,300,976\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,286,872\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gain) loss on sale of depreciable real estate assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(55,003\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on consolidation of third-party development \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(11,239\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDA\nre\n of an unconsolidated affiliate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,363\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,350\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEBITDA\nre\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,236,097\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,288,284\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss (gain) on embedded derivative in preferred shares \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18,751\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(18,528\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(54\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on investments \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(7,809\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(4,449\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasualty related (recoveries) charges, net \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(9,326\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n980\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on debt extinguishment \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(57\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal costs, settlements and (recoveries), net \n(1) (2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,437\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(4,454\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\nre\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,247,150\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,261,722\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nIncluded in “Other non-operating (income) expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  \n\n\n(2)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, in accordance with our accounting policies, we recognized $8.0 million of accrued legal defense costs that are expected to be incurred through July 2027.\n\n\nOur net debt to Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n ratio as of December 31, 2024 was 4.0x, as compared to a ratio of 3.6x as of December 31, 2023. The change in the ratio was primarily due to a decrease of $14.6 million in Adjusted EBITDA\nre \nfor the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 and an increase of $439.0 million in comparing net debt as of December 31, 2024 to net debt as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n was primarily due to an increase in property operating expenses and property management expenses partially offset by an increase in property revenues, while the increase in net debt was primarily due to an increase in unsecured notes payable, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in unsecured notes payable was primarily driven by an increase in cash requirements to fund acquisition and development activities.\n \n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources.\n\n\nWe expect that our primary uses of cash will be to fund our ongoing operating needs, to fund our ongoing capital spending requirements, which relate primarily to our development, redevelopment and property repositioning activities, to repay maturing borrowings, to fund the future acquisition of assets and to pay shareholder dividends. We expect to meet our cash requirements through net cash flows from operating activities, existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility, the future issuance of debt and equity and the future disposition of assets.\n\n\nWe historically have had positive net cash flows from operating activities. We believe that future net cash flows generated from operating activities, existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under our current commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, and our ability to issue debt and equity will provide sufficient liquidity to fund the cash requirements for our business over the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $1.0 billion of combined unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available capacity under our revolving credit facility.\n \n\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $38.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \n \nThe decrease in operating cash flows was primarily driven by an increase in property operating expenses.\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $825.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $50.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we acquired three apartment communities and closed on the pre-purchase of a multifamily development community. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired two apartment communities. The decrease in cash outflows for capital improvements and other was primarily driven by decreased capital spend relating to our property redevelopment and repositioning activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash outflows for development costs was primarily driven by increased development activity, including financing a third-party’s development of a 239-unit multifamily apartment community currently under construction located in Charlotte, North Carolina, during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash outflows for contributions to affiliates was driven by a lesser amount of investments made in the technology-focused limited partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash inflows from proceeds from real estate asset dispositions resulted from the disposition of two multifamily communities during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the disposition of one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash inflows from proceeds from sale of marketable equity securities resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to no marketable securities being sold during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash inflows from net proceeds from insurance recoveries was driven by increased insurance reimbursements received for property and storm-related casualty claims during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $271.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $96.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increase in cash inflows from proceeds from notes payable resulted from the issuance of $1.1 billion of unsecured senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to no issuance of unsecured senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable primarily resulted from the retirement of $400.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the retirement of $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash outflows related to payment of deferred financing costs resulted from the closing costs of $10.3 million related to the issuance of $1.1 billion of unsecured senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to negligible deferred financing costs during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to $5.880 per share during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the dividend rate of $5.600 per share during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash inflows related to the proceeds from issuances of common shares resulted from the proceeds from the settlement of two forward sale agreements with respect to a total of 1.1 million shares at a forward price per share of $185.23 during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash outflows from the acquisition of noncontrolling interests resulted from the acquisition of a 5% noncontrolling interest of a consolidated real estate entity for $15.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash inflows from the net change in other financing activities was primarily driven by fewer shares of MAA’s common stock surrendered by employees to satisfy their statutory minimum federal and state tax obligations associated with the vesting of restricted shares, and more contributions received from noncontrolling interest during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\nDebt\n\n\nThe following schedule reflects our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPrincipal Balance\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAverage Years to Rate Maturity\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted Average Effective Rate\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsecured debt\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed rate senior notes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,400,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable rate commercial paper\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n250,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt issuance costs, discounts and premiums\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(29,310\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal unsecured debt\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,620,690\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecured debt\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed rate property mortgages\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n363,293\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt issuance costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3,026\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal secured debt\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n360,267\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal debt\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,980,957\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following schedule presents the contractual maturity dates of our outstanding debt, net of debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums, as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCommercial Paper \n(1)\n & Revolving Credit Facility \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSenior Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nProperty Mortgages\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n250,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n399,340\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n649,340\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n298,744\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n298,744\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n598,121\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n598,121\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n397,911\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n397,911\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n556,359\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n556,359\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2030\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n298,230\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n298,230\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2031\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n446,302\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n446,302\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n394,680\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n394,680\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2033\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2034\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n343,795\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n343,795\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n637,208\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n360,267\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n997,475\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n250,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,370,690\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n360,267\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,980,957\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nThere was $250.0 million outstanding under MAALP\n’\ns commercial paper program as of December 31, 2024.

Holders of OP Units (other than MAA) may require us to redeem their OP Units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per OP Unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of MAA’s common stock on the NYSE over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of MAA’s common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each OP Unit so redeemed.  MAA has registered under the Securities Act the 3,075,552 shares of its common stock that, as of December 31, 2024, were issuable upon redemption of OP Units, in order for those shares to be sold freely in the public markets.\n\n\nIn August 2021, MAA entered into two 18-month forward sale agreements with respect to a total of 1.1 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward sale price of $190.56 per share, which is net of issuance costs. In January 2023, MAA settled its two forward sale agreements with respect to all 1.1 million shares at a forward price per share of $185.23, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate, the amount of dividends paid to holders of MAA’s common stock and commissions paid to sales agents, for net proceeds of $203.7 million. We have used these proceeds primarily to fund our development and redevelopment activities.\n\n\nMAA has entered into an at-the-money equity offering program, or ATM program, enabling MAA to sell shares of its common stock into the existing market at current market prices from time to time to or through the sales agents under the ATM program. Pursuant to the ATM program, MAA from time to time may also enter into forward sale agreements and sell shares of its common stock pursuant to these agreements. Through the ATM program, MAA may issue up to an aggregate of 4.0 million shares of its common stock at such times as determined by MAA.\n \n\n\nMAA has no obligation to issue shares through the ATM program. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, MAA did not sell any shares of common stock under the ATM program. As of December 31, 2024, 4.0 million shares of MAA’s common stock remained issuable under the ATM program.\n\n\nFor more information regarding our equity capital resources, see Note 8 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterial Cash Requirements\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 related to contractual obligations, which consist of principal and interest on our debt obligations and right-of-use lease liabilities (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt obligations \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n650,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n300,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n600,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n400,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n550,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,513,293\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,013,293\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed rate interest\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n170,937\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n160,086\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n145,986\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n126,786\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n107,524\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n739,875\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,451,194\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-of-use lease liabilities \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,043\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,093\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,131\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,709\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n815\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n54,856\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n66,647\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n823,980\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n463,179\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n749,117\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n528,495\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n658,339\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,308,024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,531,134\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nRepresents principal payments gross of debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.\n\n\n(2)\nPrimarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community we own and the lease of our corporate headquarters.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we also had obligations, which are not reflected in the table above, to make additional capital contributions to six technology-focused limited partnerships in which we hold equity interests. The capital contributions may be called by the general partners at any time after giving appropriate notice.

Total expected costs for the seven development projects are $851.5 million, of which $477.2 million had been incurred through December 31, 2024.  In addition, our property redevelopment and repositioning activities are ongoing, and we incur expenditures relating to recurring capital replacements, which typically include scheduled carpet replacement, new roofs, HVAC units, plumbing, concrete, masonry and other paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. For the year ending December 31, 2025, we expect that our total capital expenditures relating to our development activities, our property redevelopment and repositioning activities and recurring capital replacements will be in line with our total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect to have additional development projects in the future.\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we acquired three multifamily apartment communities for approximately $271 million and acquired three land parcels for future development for approximately $30\n \nmillion. These activities were funded from borrowings under the commercial paper program and available cash on hand.\n \n\n\nWe typically declare cash dividends on MAA’s common stock on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by MAA’s Board of Directors. We expect to pay quarterly dividends at an annual rate of $6.06 per share of MAA common stock during the year ending December 31, 2025. The timing and amount of future dividends will depend on actual cash flows from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other factors as MAA’s Board of Directors deems relevant.  MAA’s Board of Directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time.\n \n\n\nInflation\n\n\nOur resident leases at our apartment communities allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal, which may enable us to seek rent increases.  The majority of our leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation on our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we experienced inflationary pressures that drove higher operating expenses, primarily in personnel, real estate taxes, utilities, office operations, insurance and marketing expenses.\n \n\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\n\nA critical accounting estimate is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty.  The preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances.  We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\n\n\nWe believe that the estimates and assumptions summarized below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and they have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAcquisition of real estate assets\n\n\nWe account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, \nBusiness Combinations, \nwhich requires the cost of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements and other, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts, on a relative fair value basis. In calculating the asset value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, management may use significant subjective inputs, including forecasted net operating income, or NOI, and market specific capitalization and discount rates. Management analyzes stabilized NOI to determine its estimate for forecasted NOI. Management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for sold properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. Management allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired.\n \n\n\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n\n\nWe account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Management periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including investments in real estate, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment, right-of-use lease assets and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, or an asset group.  Management generally considers the individual assets of an apartment community to collectively represent an asset group.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Management calculates the fair value of an asset by dividing estimated future annual cash flow by a market capitalization rate. No material impairment losses were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \n\n\nOur impairment assessments may contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of the assets. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and the fair value of an asset include projecting an apartment community’s NOI, estimating asset hold periods and recurring capital expenditures, as well as selecting an appropriate market capitalization rate. Management considers its apartment communities’ historical stabilized NOI performance, local market economics and the business environment impacting our apartment communities as the basis in projecting forecasted NOI, which management believes is representative of future cash flows. Management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for sold properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.\n \n\n\nValuation of embedded derivative\n\n\nThe redemption feature embedded in the MAA Series I preferred stock is reported as a derivative asset and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date, with a corresponding non-cash adjustment to the statement of operations. The derivative asset related to the redemption feature is valued using widely accepted valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow analysis in which the perpetual value of the preferred shares is compared to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised, with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values. The analysis reflects the contractual terms of the redeemable preferred shares, which are redeemable at our option beginning on October 1, 2026 and at the redemption price of $50 per share. We may use various significant inputs in the analysis, including risk adjusted yields of relevant MAALP bond issuances and yields and spreads of relevant indices, estimated yields on preferred stock instruments from REITs with similar credit ratings as us, treasury rates and trading data available of prices of the preferred shares, to determine the fair value of the bifurcated call option. As a result of the adjustments recorded to reflect the change in fair value of the derivative asset, the fair value of the embedded derivative asset decreased to $13.2 million as of December 31, 2024 as compared to $31.9 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease in value of the asset of $18.7 million.\n\n\nArriving at the valuation of the embedded derivative requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and the valuation of the embedded derivative is highly sensitive to changes in certain inputs in the analysis. For example, changes in the inputs of the MAALP bond yields, estimated yields on preferred stock instruments from REITs with similar credit ratings as MAA and treasury rates could cause the valuation of the embedded derivative to materially change from the recorded balance as of December 31, 2024.\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n\n\nFor more information regarding our significant accounting policies, including the accounting polices related to the critical accounting estimates discussed above as well as a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on our financial statements, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
