Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) was prepared to provide a historical and prospective narrative on our financial condition and results of operations through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. The discussion and analysis of the 2023 to 2022 year-over-year changes are not included herein and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur MD&A is organized as follows:\n•\nOverview\n•\nResults of Operations\n•\nSegment Analysis\n•\nCore Performance Measures\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nEnvironment\n•\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n•\nNew Accounting Standards\n•\nForward-Looking Statements\nOVERVIEW \nCorning is vital to progress – in the industries we help advance and in the world we share. For more than 170 years, Corning has combined its unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with deep manufacturing and engineering capabilities to develop category-defining products that transform industries and enhance people’s lives. Our materials science and manufacturing expertise, boundless curiosity and commitment to purposeful invention place us at the center of the way the world works, learns and lives. In addition, our sustained investment in research, development and engineering capabilities means we are always ready to solve the toughest challenges – alongside our customers.\nOur capabilities are versatile and synergistic, allowing Corning to evolve to meet changing market needs, while also helping customers capture new opportunities in dynamic industries. Corning strives to be a catalyst for positive change and to help move the world forward. The Company drives profitable multiyear growth by inventing, making and selling life-changing products – all of which is based on a set of vital capabilities that are increasingly relevant to profound transformations that touch many facets of daily life. Today, Corning's markets include optical communications, mobile consumer electronics, display, automotive, solar, semiconductor and life sciences.\nGoing into 2024, we introduced our three-year Springboard plan to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026. As we capture this growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals because we already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place, and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials. Additionally, we expect to achieve an operating margin target of 20% by the end of 2026.\nIn 2024, we began marking important milestones toward our Springboard plan – including the implementation of price increases in Display Technologies and growth in Optical Communications driven by increased demand for our new Generative AI products. And in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 we grew quarterly sales while growing profit significantly faster, resulting in a strong close to the first year of Springboard.\nOverall, we expect our businesses to benefit from a convergence of cyclical and secular trends, driving sales and profit growth across the company through 2026, and we are energized about the tremendous value Springboard creates for shareholders.\n2025 Corporate Outlook\nWe expect core net sales of approximately $3.6 billion for the first quarter of 2025.\n24\nTable of  Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents selected highlights from our operations (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n% change\n2024\n2023\n24 vs. 23\nNet sales\n$\n13,118\n \n$\n12,588 \n4 \n%\nCost of sales\n$\n8,842\n \n$\n8,657 \n2 \n%\nGross margin\n$\n4,276\n \n$\n3,931 \n9 \n%\nGross margin %\n33\n \n%\n31 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n1,931\n \n$\n1,843 \n5 \n%\nas a % of net sales\n15\n \n%\n15 \n%\nResearch, development and engineering expenses\n$\n1,089\n \n$\n1,076 \n1 \n%\nas a % of net sales\n8\n \n%\n9 \n%\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net\n$\n83\n \n$\n161 \n(48 \n%)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n813\n \n$\n816 \n0 \n%\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n221\n \n$\n168 \n32 \n%\nEffective tax rate\n27.2\n \n%\n20.6 \n%\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $530 million, or 4%, when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in sales for telecommunication products of $645 million and specialty glass products of $146 million, partially offset by a decrease in sales for polycrystalline silicon products of $149 million and environmental substrate and filter products of $95 million. Refer to the “Segment Analysis” section of our MD&A below for a discussion of net sales by segment.\nIn 2024 and 2023, sales in international markets accounted for 64% and 67% of total net sales, respectively.\nCost of Sales / Gross Margin\nThe types of expenses included in cost of sales are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; freight and logistics costs; and other production overhead.\nGross margin increased by $345 million, or 9% and gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased by 2 percentage points when compared to 2023. The increase in gross margin is primarily driven by the increase in net sales, as discussed above. Since 2023, actions were taken by management to improve profitability, including raising prices, restoring our productivity levels and normalizing inventory levels, which has resulted in improvements in gross margin as a percentage of net sales.\n25\nTable of  Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \nThe types of expenses included in selling, general and administrative expenses are: salaries, wages and benefits, including variable compensation and share-based compensation expense; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities and rent for administrative facilities.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $88 million, or 5%, when compared to 2023 primarily due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above, and remained consistent as a percentage of net sales.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses \nResearch, development and engineering expenses increased by $13 million, or 1%, and decreased as a percentage of net sales by 1 percentage point when compared to 2023.\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net \nIncluded in translated earnings contract gain, net, is the impact of foreign currency contracts which economically hedge the translation exposure arising from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, euro, Chinese yuan, Mexican peso and British pound and its impact on net income.\nThe following table provides detailed information on the impact of translated earnings contract gain, net (in millions):\nIncome before tax\nNet income\nIncome before tax\nNet income\nIncome before tax\nNet income\n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\nHedges related to translated earnings:\nRealized gain, net \n(1) (2)\n$\n194\n \n$\n149\n \n$\n247 \n$\n198 \n$\n(53)\n$\n(49)\nUnrealized loss, net\n(111)\n(85)\n(86)\n(68)\n(25)\n(17)\nTotal translated earnings contract gain, net\n$\n83\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n161 \n$\n130 \n$\n(78)\n$\n(66)\n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, amount includes non-cash pre-tax realized losses of $85 million and $68 million, respectively, related to the premiums of expired option contracts.\n(2)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, amount excludes an $11 million gain related to a forward contract designated as a net investment hedge, which was reflected within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe impact to income from realized activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by realized gains from our Japanese yen-denominated hedges, partially offset by realized losses from our South Korean won, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and Mexican peso-denominated hedges. The impact to income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by realized gains from our Japanese yen-denominated hedges, partially offset by realized losses from our South Korean won and Chinese yuan-denominated hedges.\nThe impact to income from unrealized activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by unrealized losses from our South Korean won, Japanese yen, new Taiwan dollar and Chinese yuan-denominated hedges, partially offset by unrealized gains from our euro-denominated hedges. The impact to income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by unrealized losses from our Japanese Yen, South Korean won and euro-denominated hedges.\n26\nTable of  Contents\nIncome before income taxes\nIncome before income taxes remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023, driven by an increase in operating income of $245 million as a result of the increase in net sales and cost of sales, as discussed above, partially offset by the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as discussed above. The improved operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 is offset by increases of non-operating expenses of $248 million, primarily due to the recognition of $145 million \nof non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses in \n2024\n related to the substantial liquidation and disposition of foreign entities, which was recorded in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income\n, and \n$49 million\n \nof non-cash charges recognized in \n2024\n in one of our Emerging Growth Businesses relating to a customer that recently entered into a multi-jurisdictional restructuring effort including insolvency filings in certain countries. These charges primarily relate to the full write-down of upfront payments made to the customer, which were determined to be nonrecoverable, and recorded as a charge to net sales in the consolidated statements of income\n. \nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to non-deductible items, including the release of cumulative translation losses and changes in tax reserves, partially offset by non-taxable items, tax credits generated, foreign derived intangible income and changes in valuation allowance assessments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax credits generated, non-taxable items, foreign derived intangible income and stock compensation windfall deductions, partially offset by changes in valuation allowance assessments, non-deductible items and tax reserves.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to the release of cumulative translation losses, non-deductible items and tax credits generated, partially offset by changes in valuation allowance assessments.\nRefer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters.\nThe U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) in August 2022, which, among other sections, creates a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of consolidated pre-tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of $1 billion. The IRA also provides credit incentives to taxpayers based on the type and amount of manufacturing activity performed. None of the provisions within the IRA are expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.\nIn December 2022, the European Union (“EU”) Member States formally adopted the EU Pillar Two Framework (“Pillar Two Framework”), which generally provides for a 15% global minimum effective tax rate, based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines. Certain countries have enacted this tax law change, with an effective date starting January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, for certain aspects of the directive. The impact of the Pillar Two Framework is not material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flow as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n27\nTable of  Contents\nSEGMENT ANALYSIS\nFinancial results for the reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are prepared on a basis consistent with the internal disaggregation of financial information to assist the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in making internal operating decisions, which is more fully discussed within Note 17 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and includes a reconciliation of our segment information to the corresponding amounts in our consolidated statements of income.\nSegment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.\nThe following table presents segment net sales by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n$ change\n% change\n2024\n2023\n24 vs. 23\n24 vs. 23\nOptical Communications\n$\n4,657\n \n$\n4,012 \n$\n645 \n16 \n%\nDisplay Technologies\n3,872\n \n3,532 \n340 \n10 \n%\nSpecialty Materials\n2,018\n \n1,865 \n153 \n8 \n%\nEnvironmental Technologies\n1,665\n \n1,766 \n(101)\n(6)\n%\nLife Sciences\n979\n \n959 \n20 \n2 \n%\nNet sales of reportable segments\n13,191\n \n12,134 \n1,057 \n9 \n%\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\n1,278\n \n1,446 \n(168)\n(12)\n%\nNet sales of reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging \n   Growth Businesses \n(1)\n$\n14,469\n \n$\n13,580 \n$\n889 \n7 \n%\n(1)\nRefer to Note 17 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to consolidated net sales.\nOptical Communications\nThe increase in segment net sales was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of AI-related connectivity solutions used in data centers in our Enterprise business. \nDisplay Technologies\nThe increase in segment net sales was primarily due to higher sales volume, attributable to increased panel maker utilization and growth in the retail and glass market driven by larger average screen size, as well as pricing actions taken in the second half of 2023 and the second half of 2024.\nSpecialty Materials\nThe increase in segment net sales was primarily due to continued strong demand for premium glass for mobile devices as well as semiconductor-related products.\nEnvironmental Technologies\nThe decrease in segment net sales was primarily due to the continued impact of a weaker global heavy-duty diesel market particularly in Europe.\nLife Sciences\nSegment net sales increased 2% despite the market stabilizing throughout the year.\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\nThe decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our HSG business driven by lower volume and lower pricing for solar-grade polysilicon.\n28\nTable of  Contents\nThe following table presents segment net income by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses (in millions):\n \nYear ended December 31,\n$ change \n% change\n \n2024\n2023\n24 vs. 23\n24 vs. 23\nOptical Communications\n$\n612\n \n$\n478 \n$\n134 \n28 \n%\nDisplay Technologies\n1,006\n \n842 \n164 \n19 \n%\nSpecialty Materials\n260\n \n202 \n58 \n29 \n%\nEnvironmental Technologies\n358\n \n386 \n(28)\n(7)\n%\nLife Sciences\n63\n \n50 \n13 \n26 \n%\nNet income of reportable segments\n2,299\n \n1,958 \n341 \n17 \n%\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\n(55)\n15 \n(70)\n*\nNet income of reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging\n   Growth Businesses \n(1)\n$\n2,244\n \n$\n1,973 \n$\n271 \n14 \n%\n*\nNot meaningful\n(1)\nRefer to Note 17 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to consolidated net income.\nOptical Communications\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by strong incremental profit on higher sales volume, as outlined above.\nDisplay Technologies\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by the increase in sales, as outlined above, and improved profitability which includes the impact of price increases.\nSpecialty Materials\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by strong incremental profit on higher volumes.\nEnvironmental Technologies\nThe decrease in segment net income was primarily driven by the decrease in sales, as outlined above.\nLife Sciences\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by profitability improvements from productivity actions taken.\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\nThe decrease was primarily driven by our HSG business due to lower sales, as outlined above.\n29\nTable of  Contents\nCORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES \nIn managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures included in our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at our core performance measures. These items include the impact of translating the Japanese yen-denominated debt, the impact of the translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits, certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect the ongoing operating results of the Company.\nIn addition, because a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. Therefore, management utilizes constant-currency reporting for the Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar and euro, as applicable to the segment. In addition, effective January 1, 2024, the Company began utilizing constant-currency reporting for the Optical Communications segment to exclude the impact from the Mexican peso on segment results. Prior periods were not recast as the impact was not material. The most significant constant-currency adjustment relates to the Japanese yen exposure within the Display Technologies segment. The constant-currency rates established for our core performance measures are internally derived long-term management estimates, which are closely aligned with our hedging instrument rates. These hedging instruments may include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange forward or option contracts and foreign-denominated debt. For details of the rates used, refer to the footnotes to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” section.\nWe believe that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts.\nCore performance measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We provide investors with these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our results as we believe they are indicative of our core operating performance and provide greater transparency to how management evaluates our results and trends and makes financial and operational decisions. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because management does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of management’s control. As a result, management is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.\nFor a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.”\n30\nTable of  Contents\nResults of Operations – Core Performance Measures\nThe following table presents selected highlights from our operations, excluding certain items, (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31,\n% change\n2024\n \n2023\n24 vs. 23\nCore net sales\n$\n14,469\n \n$\n13,580 \n7 \n%\nCore net income\n$\n1,699\n \n$\n1,463 \n16 \n%\nCore earnings per share\n$\n1.96\n \n$\n1.70 \n15 \n%\nCore Net Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated core net sales of $14.5 billion compared to core net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $13.6 billion. The increase in core net sales of $0.9 billion was primarily driven by higher reportable segment net sales in Optical Communications of $645 million, Display Technologies of $340 million and Specialty Materials of $153 million, partially offset by a decrease in net sales from Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses of $168 million and Environmental Technologies of $101 million. Net sales of reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are discussed in detail in the “Segment Analysis” section of our MD&A.\nCore Net Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated core net income of $1.7 billion, or $1.96 per share, compared to core net income generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $1.5 billion, or $1.70 per share. The increase in core net income of $0.2 billion was driven by higher reportable segment net income in Display Technologies of $164 million, Optical Communications of $134 million, Specialty Materials of $58 million, partially offset by a decrease from Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses of $70 million. Net income of reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are discussed in detail in the “Segment Analysis” section of our MD&A.\nCore Earnings per Share\nCore earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 to $1.96 per share, as a result of the increase in core net income, as outlined above.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of core earnings per share (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCore net income\n$\n1,699\n \n$\n1,463 \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - basic\n853\n \n848 \nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options and other awards\n16\n \n11 \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted\n869\n \n859 \nCore earnings per share\n$\n1.96\n \n$\n1.70 \n31\nTable of  Contents\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nWe utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income or statements of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income or statements of cash flows.\nCore net sales, core net income and core earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in our operations.\nRefer to “Items Adjusted from GAAP Measures” for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.\nThe following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (amounts in millions, except percentages and per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nNet sales\nIncome before income taxes\n \nNet income attributable to Corning Incorporated\nEffective tax rate (a)(b)\nPer Share\nAs reported - GAAP\n$\n13,118\n \n$\n813\n \n$\n506\n \n27.2\n \n%\n$\n0.58\n \nConstant-currency adjustment \n(1)\n1,309 \n989 \n773 \n0.89 \nTranslation gain on Japanese yen-denominated debt, net \n(2)\n \n(104)\n(80)\n(0.09)\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net \n(3)\n \n(83)\n(64)\n(0.07)\nAcquisition-related costs \n(4)\n \n128 \n92 \n0.11 \nDiscrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments \n(5)\n \n21 \n0.02 \nRestructuring, impairment and other charges and credits \n(6)\n42 \n407 \n374 \n0.43 \nLitigation, regulatory and other legal matters \n(7)\n \n12 \n9 \n0.01 \nPension mark-to-market adjustment \n(8)\n \n3 \n2 \n \nLoss on investments \n(9)\n \n23 \n22 \n0.03 \nLoss on sale of assets \n(10)\n \n27 \n20 \n0.02 \nLoss on sale of business \n(11)\n \n31 \n24 \n0.03 \nCore performance measures\n$\n14,469 \n$\n2,246 \n$\n1,699 \n20.3 \n%\n$\n1.96 \n(a)\nBased upon statutory tax rates in the specific jurisdiction for each event.\n(b)\nThe calculation of the effective tax rate for GAAP and core excludes net income attributable to non-controlling interest of approximately $86 million and $92 million, respectively.\n32\nTable of  Contents\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nNet sales\nIncome before income taxes\nNet income attributable to Corning Incorporated\nEffective tax rate (a)(b)\nPer Share\nAs reported - GAAP\n$\n12,588\n \n$\n816\n \n$\n581\n \n20.6\n \n%\n$\n0.68\n \nConstant-currency adjustment \n(1)\n992 \n744 \n550 \n0.64 \nTranslation gain on Japanese yen-denominated debt, net \n(2)\n(100)\n(81)\n(0.09)\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net \n(3)\n(161)\n(130)\n(0.15)\nAcquisition-related costs \n(4)\n131 \n90 \n0.10 \nDiscrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments \n(5)\n34 \n0.04 \nRestructuring, impairment and other charges and credits \n(6)\n471 \n378 \n0.44 \nLitigation, regulatory and other legal matters \n(7)\n61 \n54 \n0.06 \nPension mark-to-market adjustment \n(8)\n15 \n12 \n0.01 \nGain on investments \n(9)\n(10)\n(10)\n(0.01)\nGain on sale of assets \n(10)\n(20)\n(15)\n(0.02)\nCore performance measures\n$\n13,580 \n$\n1,947 \n$\n1,463 \n20.7 \n%\n$\n1.70 \n(a)\nBased upon statutory tax rates in the specific jurisdiction for each event.\n(b)\nThe calculation of the effective tax rate GAAP and core excludes net income attributable to non-controlling interest of approximately $67 million and $81 million, respectively.\nRefer to “Items Adjusted from GAAP Measures” for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.\nItems Adjusted from GAAP Measures\nItems adjusted from GAAP measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows:\n(1)\nConstant-currency adjustment\n: As a significant portion of revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. The Company utilizes constant-currency reporting for Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar and euro, as applicable to the segment. In addition, effective January 1, 2024, the Company began utilizing constant-currency reporting for the Optical Communications segment to exclude the impact from the Mexican peso on segment results. Prior periods were not recast as the impact was not material.   \nThe constant-currency rates established for our core performance measures are internally derived long-term management estimates, which are closely aligned with our hedging instrument rates. These hedging instruments may include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange forward or option contracts and foreign-denominated debt. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the adjustment primarily relates to our Japanese yen exposure due to the difference in the average spot rate compared to our core rate.\nWe believe that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuation, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts.\nConstant-currency rates used are as follows and are applied to all periods presented and to all foreign exchange exposures during the period, with the exception of the Mexican peso as discussed above, even though we may be less than 100% hedged:\nCurrency\nJapanese yen\nKorean won\nChinese yuan\nNew Taiwan dollar\nEuro\nMexican peso\nRate\n¥107\n₩1,175\n¥6.7\nNT$31\n€0.81\nMX$20\n(2)\nTranslation of Japanese yen-denominated debt\n: Amount reflects the gain or loss on the translation of our yen-denominated debt to U.S. dollars, net of a $15 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, related to the change in the fair value of our cross currency swap contracts, \nrecorded in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income\n.\n(3)\nTranslated earnings contract\n: Amount reflects the impact of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro, New Taiwan dollar and Mexican peso-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, as well as the unrealized gains and losses of our British pound-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings.\n33\nTable of  Contents\n(4)\nAcquisition-related costs\n: Amount reflects intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs, as well as other transaction related costs.\n(5)\nDiscrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments\n: Amount reflects certain discrete period tax items such as changes in tax law, the impact of tax audits, changes in tax reserves and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, as well as other tax-related adjustments.\n(6)\nRestructuring, impairment and other charges and credits\n: Amount reflects certain restructuring, impairment losses and other charges and credits, as well as other expenses, including severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and facility repairs resulting from power outages, and the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments upon the substantial liquidation or disposition of a foreign entity, which are not related to ongoing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2024, amount includes $131 million \nof non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses required to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation or disposition of foreign entities, which was recorded in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income\n. Amount also includes $49 million \nof non-cash charges in one of our Emerging Growth Businesses relating to a customer that recently entered into a multi-jurisdictional restructuring effort including insolvency filings in certain countries. These charges primarily relate to the full write-down of upfront payments made to the customer, which were determined to be nonrecoverable, and recorded as a charge to net sales in the consolidated statements of income\n. Other charges recorded during 2024 related to asset write-offs associated with the exit of certain facilities and product lines. The activity in 2023 primarily relates to asset write-offs associated with the exit of certain facilities and product lines and severance charges across all segments. \n(7)\nLitigation, regulatory and other legal matters\n: Amount reflects developments in commercial litigation, intellectual property disputes, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters.\n(8)\nPension mark-to-market adjustment\n: Amount primarily reflects defined benefit pension mark-to-market gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.\n(9)\nLoss (gain) on investments\n: Amount reflects the loss or gain recognized on investments due to mark-to-market adjustments for the change in fair value or the disposition of an investment.\n(10)\nLoss (gain) on sale of assets\n: Amount represents the loss or gain recognized for the sale of assets, recorded in cost of sales, in the consolidated statements of income.  \n(11)\nLoss on sale of business\n: Amount reflects the loss recognized for the sale of a business, \nrecorded in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income, and includes $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses related to the disposition of a foreign entity\n.\n34\nTable of  Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nOur financial condition and liquidity are strong. We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix of such resources.\nOur major sources of funding for 2025 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and meet our obligations for the foreseeable future. Such obligations may include requirements for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchases. We will continue to generate cash from operations and maintain access to our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs as discussed in more detail below.\nKey Balance Sheet Data \nWe fund our working capital with cash from operations and, periodically, short-term and long-term borrowings. In addition, from time to time, we receive upfront cash from customers relating to long-term supply agreements, as well as cash incentives from government entities generally for capital expansion and related expenses.\nThe following table presents balance sheet and working capital measures (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nWorking capital\n$\n3,073\n \n$\n2,893 \nCurrent ratio\n1.6:1\n1.7:1\nTrade accounts receivable, net of doubtful accounts\n$\n2,053\n \n$\n1,572 \nDays sales outstanding\n53\n47\nInventories\n$\n2,724\n \n$\n2,666 \nInventory turns\n3.2\n \n3.2 \nDays payable outstanding \n(1)\n54\n52\nLong-term debt\n$\n6,885\n \n$\n7,206 \nTotal debt\n$\n7,211\n \n$\n7,526 \nTotal debt to total capital\n39%\n39%\n(1)\nIncludes trade payables only.\nWe perform comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments to identify potential customer credit issues. We are not aware of any customer credit issues that could have a material impact on our liquidity.\nWe participate in accounts receivable management programs, including factoring arrangements to sell certain accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions or accelerate collections through our customer’s supply chain financing arrangements. Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. By utilizing these types of programs, we accelerated the collection of $182 million in accounts receivable during the three months ended December 31, 2024, which would have been collected during the normal course of business in the following quarter.\n35\nTable of  Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flow data (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,939\n \n$\n2,005 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(744)\n$\n(1,000)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(1,164)\n$\n(883)\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the decrease in net income partially offset by improvements in working capital. \nNet cash used in investing activities improved by $256 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower capital expenditures of $425 million, partially offset by higher premiums paid on hedging contracts of $89 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $281 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities primarily related to dividend payments of $986 million and purchases of common stock for treasury of $165 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in financing activities primarily related to dividend payments of $989 million and the redemption of preferred stock of $507 million, partially offset by $918 million in proceeds received from the issuance of euro-denominated notes in May 2023.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe generate strong ongoing cash flows from operations, which is our principal source of liquidity. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash flows provided by operating activities were $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and available credit capacity included (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,768 \nAvailable credit capacity:\n \nU.S. dollar revolving credit facility\n$\n1,500 \nChinese yuan facilities\n$\n31 \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe ended 2024 with $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 64% of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company distributed an immaterial amount from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies. As of December 31, 2024, Corning had approximately $1.6 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes. We do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings for which we asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested.\n36\nTable of  Contents\nDebt Facilities and Other Sources of Liquidity\nWe have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion. Under this program, we may issue commercial paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any commercial paper outstanding.\nOur $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, if needed. There were no outstanding amounts under this facility as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. As of December 31, 2024, our leverage using this measure was approximately 39%. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nOur debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default exceeding a specified amount on one debt obligation, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all such provisions.\nWe have access to certain Chinese yuan-denominated unsecured variable rate loan facilities, whose proceeds are used for capital investment and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, borrowings totaled $314 million and these facilities had variable interest rates ranging from 2.8% to 3.9% and maturities ranging from 2025 to 2032. As of December 31, 2024, Corning had 0.2 billion Chinese yuan of unused capacity, equivalent to approximately $31 million.\nAs a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC on December 1, 2023. Under this shelf registration statement we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depository shares and warrants.\nRefer to Note 10 (Debt) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCustomer Deposits, Deferred Revenue and Government Incentives\nWe receive cash deposits or consideration, generally non-refundable, from customers under long-term supply agreements. In addition, we receive government assistance, typically in the form of cash incentives primarily for capital expansion projects and tax credits that are refundable or transferable.\nRefer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Revenue) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nUses of Cash\nShare Repurchase Agreement\nPursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement (“SRA”) with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (“SDC”), 22 million common shares held by SDC can be offered to be sold to Corning in specified tranches from time to time in calendar years 2024 through 2027. Corning may, at its sole discretion, elect to repurchase such common shares. If Corning elects not to repurchase the common shares and SDC sells the common shares on the open market, Corning is required to pay SDC a make-whole payment, subject to a 5% cap of the repurchase proceeds that otherwise would have been paid by Corning. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the liability associated with this option, measured using Level 2 inputs, was not material. \nRefer to Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nShare Repurchases\nIn 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of additional common stock (“2019 Authorization”).\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately $3.1 billion remains available under our 2019 Authorization, which does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nRefer to Note 14 (Shareholders' Equity) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n37\nTable of  Contents\nCommon Stock Dividends \nThe Board’s decision to declare and pay future dividends will depend on our income and liquidity position, among other factors. We expect to declare quarterly dividends and fund payments with cash from operations.\nOn February 12, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock, which will be payable on March 28, 2025.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $1.0 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect our 2025 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion.\nCurrent Maturities of Short and Long-Term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2024, the maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows, with approximately $1.4 billion due over the next five years, of which $326 million is due in less than one year.\nRefer to Note 10 (Debt) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nOur global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 86% funded as of December 31, 2024. Our largest single pension plan is our U.S. qualified plan, which accounted for 78% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation, was 98% funded as of December 31, 2024.\nThe funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon multiple factors including actuarial assumptions, interest rates at year-end, prior investment returns and contributions made to the plans. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Corning made no voluntary contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and cash contributions to our international pension plans were $9 million. During 2025, the Company anticipates making cash contributions of $10 million to the international pension plans.\nRefer to Note 11 (Employee Retirement Plans) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nA summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2024 and details of our commitments as of December 31, 2024 related to executed leases that have not yet commenced are included within Note 12 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) and Note 5 (Leases), respectively, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements \nOff balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee and indemnity contracts. At the time a guarantee is issued, we are required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by us are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds. These guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant. We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.\nRefer to Note 12 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nENVIRONMENT\nRefer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 12 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for information.\n38\nTable of  Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following estimates are considered by management to be the most critical to the understanding of the consolidated financial statements as they require significant judgments that could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nImpairment of assets held for use\nWe are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We perform this review each quarter and exercise judgment in assessing whether impairment indicators are present.\nManufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life. The physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process is treated as depletion and these losses are accounted for as a period expense based on actual units lost. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all our precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.\nExamples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:\n•\nA significant decrease in the market price of an asset;\n•\nA significant change in the use of a long-lived asset or its physical condition;\n•\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;\n•\nAn accumulation of costs significantly more than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;\n•\nA current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and\n•\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nFor purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Our assessment is performed at the operating segment level. For most of our operating segments, we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nFor long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.\nFor an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows, including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals, if applicable. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends. We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions. We believe our current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.\n39\nTable of  Contents\nIncome taxes \nWe are subject to income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations and various related judicial opinions. We record uncertain tax positions only when they are believed to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is less than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. In estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position. As a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.\nWe must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.\nFair value measures\nAs required, we use two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on our own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels. Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement. In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets. Our major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives. These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.\nDerivative assets and liabilities may include foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. Included in our foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our cash flow and translation exposure resulting from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, British pound, euro and Mexican peso. In arriving at the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction. Amounts related to credit risk are not material.\nRefer to Note 13 (Financial Instruments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nLoss contingencies\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, environmental matters and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external counsel and actuarial determined estimates. Refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 12 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of Corning’s material litigation and environmental matters.\nPension and other postretirement employee benefits (“OPEB”)\nWe offer employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect our assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates. The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.\n40\nTable of  Contents\nThe following table presents our actual and expected return (loss) on assets, as well as the corresponding percentages (in millions, except percentages):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nActual return (loss) on plan assets – Domestic plans\n$\n303\n \n$\n281 \n$\n(728)\nExpected return on plan assets – Domestic plans\n179\n \n176 \n210 \nActual (loss) return on plan assets – International plans\n(6)\n10 \n(139)\nExpected return on plan assets – International plans\n16\n \n13 \n9 \nWeighted-average actual and expected return on assets:\nActual return (loss) on plan assets – Domestic plans\n11.74\n \n%\n10.94 \n%\n(20.05)\n%\nExpected return on plan assets – Domestic plans\n6.75\n \n%\n6.75 \n%\n6.00 \n%\nActual (loss) return on plan assets – International plans\n(1.19)\n%\n2.54 \n%\n(26.26)\n%\nExpected return on plan assets – International plans\n4.34\n \n%\n3.85 \n%\n1.64 \n%\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Projected Benefit Obligation (“PBO”) for U.S. pension plans was $3.2 billion.\nThe following table presents the estimated increases (decreases) in future ongoing pension expense and projected benefit obligation assuming a 25 basis point change in the key assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in millions):\nChange in ongoing pension expense\nChange in projected benefit obligation\n25 basis point decrease in each spot rate\n$\n(1)\n$\n75 \n25 basis point increase in each spot rate\n$\n1 \n$\n(72)\n25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets\n$\n7 \n \n25 basis point increase in expected return on assets\n$\n(7)\n \nThe above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.
