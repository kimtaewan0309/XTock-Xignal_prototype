In addition, we are a sponsor and manager of funds and joint ventures engaged in development and ownership of multifamily rental properties and a sponsor and manager of a fund engaged in ownership of single-family rental properties. We also have investments in companies that are engaged in applying technology to improve the homebuilding industry and real estate related aspects of the financial services industry.\nOur homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business, generating $34 billion in revenues, or approximately 96% of consolidated revenues, in fiscal 2024. \nAs of November 30, 2024, our reportable Homebuilding segments and all Other Homebuilding operations not required to be reported separately have divisions located in:\nEast:\n Alabama, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania\nCentral:\n Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia\nTexas: \nTexas\nWest:\n Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington\nOther:\n Urban divisions and other homebuilding related investments primarily in California, including FivePoint Holdings, LLC (\"FivePoint\")\nOur other reportable segments are Financial Services, Multifamily and Lennar Other.\n \nFinancial information about our Homebuilding, Financial Services, Multifamily and Lennar Other operations is contained in \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nof this Report.\nAbout Our Company \nOur company was founded as a local Miami homebuilder in 1954. We completed our initial public offering in 1971 and listed our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. During the 1980s and 1990s, we entered and expanded operations in a number of homebuilding markets, including California, Florida and Texas, through both organic growth and acquisitions, such as Pacific Greystone Corporation in 1997. In 2000, we acquired U.S. Home Corporation, which expanded our operations into New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota and Colorado and strengthened our position in other states. From 2002 through 2005, we acquired several regional homebuilders, which brought us into new markets and strengthened our position in several existing markets. From 2010 through 2013, we expanded our homebuilding operations into Georgia, Oregon, Washington and Tennessee. In 2017, we acquired WCI Communities, Inc., a homebuilder of luxury single-family and multifamily homes, including a small number of luxury high-rise tower units, in Florida. In 2018, we acquired CalAtlantic Group, Inc. (\"CalAtlantic\"), a major homebuilder which was building homes across the homebuilding spectrum, from entry level to luxury, in 43 metropolitan statistical areas spanning 19 states, and providing mortgage, title and escrow services.\nWe are focused on increasing efficiencies in our building process and reducing selling, general and administrative expenses by using technology and innovative strategies to reduce customer acquisition costs. Our construction playbook has three primary areas of focus: lowering construction costs, reducing cycle time and achieving even flow production. We have aimed to maintain strong operating margins by deferring home sale price commitments until construction costs are finalized to protect against cost escalations. We focus on executing our operating strategy to be a consistent and high-volume homebuilder with production pace in sync with sales pace while using our gross margin as a shock absorber. In addition, we are continuing our transition to a land light operating model by increasing the percentage of land we control through options or agreements but do not own, which reduces our years’ supply of owned homesites. In connection with this transition, we expect to spin off a significant portion of our land assets to Millrose (as defined below), as discussed further below under the caption “Homebuilding Operations – Millrose Spin-Off.”\nHomebuilding Operations\nOverview\nOur homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly through entities in which we have investments. New home deliveries, including deliveries from unconsolidated entities, were 80,210 in fiscal 2024, compared to 73,087 in fiscal 2023 and 66,399 in fiscal 2022. We primarily sell homes in communities targeted to first-time, move-up, active adult, and luxury homebuyers. The average sales price of a Lennar home varies depending on product and geographic location. For fiscal 2024, the average sales price, excluding deliveries from unconsolidated entities, was $423,000, compared to $446,000 in fiscal 2023 and $480,000 in fiscal 2022.\n1\nTable of \nContents\nWe operate primarily under the Lennar brand name. Our homebuilding mission is focused on the profitable development of residential communities. Key elements of our strategy include:\n•\nStrong Operating Margins -\n Our purchasing leverage combined with our focus on reducing selling, general and administrative costs by using technology and innovative strategies and reducing interest expense through paydowns of debt has enabled us to achieve strong gross profit and operating margins. \n•\nEverything’s Included\n®\n Approach\n - We are focused on distinguishing our products, including through our Everything’s Included\n®\n approach, which maximizes our purchasing power, enables us to include luxury features as standard items in our homes and simplifies our homebuilding operations. \n•\nInnovative Homebuilding -\n We are constantly innovating the homes we build to create products that better meet our customers' needs and desires. Our Next Gen\n®\n home provides what can be a home within a home to accommodate children or parents or can be an office from which to work remotely. \n•\nCore Plans\n - We are integrating standardized, highly efficient, value engineered Plan series across all divisions at different price points. The Core Plans are driving cost savings and strong operating margins, while delivering great value for our homebuyers.\n•\nFlexible Operating Structure\n - Our local operating structure gives us the flexibility to make operating decisions based on local homebuilding conditions and customer preferences, while our centralized management structure provides strategic oversight for our homebuilding operations.\n•\nDigital Marketing \n- We are increasingly advertising homes through digital channels, which is significantly increasing the cost effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\n•\nDynamic pricing model\n - We match up unsold production as homes progress toward completion, with pricing information from our dynamic pricing model on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis.\n•\nTechnology Focused \n- We partner with and/or invest in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industries to increase efficiencies, reduce customer acquisition costs and create a better customer experience.\n•\nLand light strategy \n- We are focused on reducing our years' supply of owned homesites and increasing the percentage of land we control through options or agreements, including agreements with strategic land banks and joint ventures, rather than ownership. In connection with this strategy, we expect to spin off a significant portion of our land assets to Millrose, as discussed further below under the caption “Homebuilding Operations – Millrose Spin-Off.”\n•\nEven flow production\n - We adjust prices, with our gross margin being a shock absorber, in an effort to maintain consistent starts and sales paces in order to generate increased market share in all the markets we build in.\nDiversified Program of Property Acquisition\nWe generally acquire, or obtain options to acquire, land for development and for the construction of homes that we sell to homebuyers. Land purchases are subject to specified underwriting criteria and are made through our diversified program of property acquisition, which may consist of:\n•\nAcquiring land through option contracts, which generally enables us to control portions of properties owned by land banks and other third parties or entities in which we have investments until we have determined whether to exercise the options;\n•\nAcquiring land directly from individual land owners/developers, or other homebuilders;\n•\nAcquiring local or regional homebuilders that own, or have options to purchase, land in strategic markets;\n•\nAcquiring access to land through joint ventures or partnerships, which among other benefits, limits the amount of our capital invested in land while helping to ensure our access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures;\n•\nInvesting in regional developers in exchange for preferential land purchase opportunities; and\n•\nAcquiring land in conjunction with our Multifamily business.\nFor the last several years, we have been reducing our reliance on land we own and increasing our access to land through options and joint ventures, most significantly through our use of land banks which is a critical part of our operating strategy. At November 30, 2024, 82% of our total homesites were controlled through options with land banks, land sellers and joint ventures compared to 76% at November 30, 2023. For additional information about our investments in and relationships with unconsolidated entities, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\n2\nTable of \nContents\nConstruction and Development\nWe are involved in all phases of planning and building in our residential communities, including land acquisition, site planning, preparation and improvement of land and design, construction and marketing of homes. We use independent subcontractors for most aspects of land development and home construction. At November 30, 2024, we were actively building and marketing homes in 1,447 communities, including 11 communities being constructed by unconsolidated entities. This was an increase from the 1,260 communities, including five communities being constructed by unconsolidated entities, in which we were actively building and marketing homes at November 30, 2023. At November 30, 2024 and 2023, we had about 2,900 and 1,200 completed unsold homes, respectively.\nWe generally supervise and control the development of land and the design and building of our residential communities with a relatively small labor force. We hire subcontractors for site improvements and virtually all of the work involved in the construction of homes. Arrangements with our subcontractors generally provide that our subcontractors will complete specified work in accordance with price and time schedules and in compliance with applicable building codes and laws. The price schedules may be subject to change to meet changes in labor and material costs or for other reasons. Although we, like homebuilders throughout the country, encountered shortages of materials and skilled labor during 2022, we believe that because of our size and our builder of choice program, where we work with our trade partners to drive efficiencies for them, we were less affected by these shortages than many of our competitors. Most shortages were eliminated due to the supply chain environment catching up to homebuilder demand as well as Lennar’s continued effort to work with our suppliers and manufacturers on the volume and specific products needed to build homes. We generally do not own heavy construction equipment. We finance construction and land development activities primarily with cash generated from operations and historically from proceeds of unsecured corporate debt. Following the Millrose Spin-Off, we expect that, when Millrose acquires undeveloped or partially developed land that we have options to purchase, Millrose will finance the horizontal development of all such homesites up to pre-negotiated development budgets, which will be incorporated into the takedown prices for Lennar’s purchase options on the properties.\nMarketing\nWe offer a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up, active adult, luxury and multi-generational homebuyers in a variety of locations ranging from urban infill communities to suburban golf course communities. Our Everything’s Included\n® \nmarketing program enables us to differentiate our homes from those of our competitors by including luxury items as standard features at competitive prices, while reducing construction and overhead costs through a simplified construction process, product standardization and volume purchasing. In addition, we include built in wireless capability, home automation and solar power in many of the homes we sell, which enhances our brand and improves our ability to generate traffic and sales.\nWe sell our homes from models that we have designed and constructed. We employ new home consultants who are paid salaries, commissions or both to conduct on-site sales of our homes. We also sell homes through independent realtors. We have made it possible for potential homebuyers to take virtual tours of model homes. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, even with shifts in macroeconomic factors and adjusting to an inflationary environment in much of the period, we were able to develop, enhance, use, and improve the Lennar machine. Our sales, marketing, and dynamic pricing machine is quickly becoming an advanced digital engine that has materially benefited from aggressive, focused use and engagement while the market was most difficult.\nOur marketing strategy has increasingly involved advertising through digital channels including real estate listing sites, paid search, display advertising, social media and e-mail marketing, all of which drive traffic to our website, www.lennar.com. This has allowed us to attract more qualified and knowledgeable homebuyers. However, we also continue to advertise through more traditional media on a limited basis, including newspapers, other local and regional publications, radio and on billboards where appropriate. We tailor our marketing strategy and message based on the community being advertised and the customers being targeted, such as advertising our active adult communities in areas where prospective active adult homebuyers live or will potentially want to purchase. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, increased interest rates as compared to prior years have made our homes less affordable to many prospective buyers and led us to reduce prices or increase sales incentives in a number of our communities to maintain sales pace.\nQuality Service\nWe continually strive to improve homeowner customer satisfaction throughout the pre-sale, sale, construction, closing and post-closing periods. We strive to create a quality homebuying experience for our customers through the participation of sales associates, on-site construction supervisors and customer care associates, all working in a team effort, as well as use of technology to simplify the homebuying and financing process. We believe this leads to enhanced customer retention and referrals. The quality of our homes is substantially affected by the efforts of on-site management and others engaged in the construction process, by the materials we use in particular homes, and by other similar factors.\n3\nTable of \nContents\nWe warrant our new homes against defective materials and workmanship for a minimum period of one year after the date of closing. Although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to the homebuyers for the correction of any deficiencies.\nLocal Operating Structure and Centralized Management\nWe balance a local operating structure with centralized corporate level management. Our local operating structure consists of homebuilding divisions across the country, each of which is usually managed by a division president, a controller and personnel focused on land acquisition, entitlement and development, sales, construction, customer service and purchasing. This local operating structure gives our division presidents and their teams, who generally have significant experience in the homebuilding industry, and in most instances, in their particular markets, the flexibility to make local operating decisions, including land identification, entitlement and development, the management of inventory levels for our current sales volume, community development, home design, construction and marketing of our homes. We centralize at the corporate level decisions related to our overall strategy, acquisitions and disposition of land and businesses, risk management, financing, cash management and information systems.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced a cancellation rate of 14% in 2024 and 16% in 2023. We do not recognize revenue on homes that are the subject of sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. \nThe backlog dollar value including unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2024 was $5.4 billion, compared to $6.6 billion at November 30, 2023. We expect that a significant portion of all homes currently in backlog will be delivered in fiscal year 2025.\nHomebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWe create and participate in joint ventures that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations, for sale to third parties or for use in the ventures' own homebuilding operations. Through these joint ventures, we reduce the amount we invest in potential future homesites, thereby reducing risks associated with land acquisitions and improving the return on our investments, and, in some instances, we obtain access to land to which we could not otherwise have obtained access or could not have obtained access on as favorable terms. As of both November 30, 2024 and 2023, we had equity investments in 51 active homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities, in which we were participating, and our maximum recourse debt exposure related to Homebuilding unconsolidated joint ventures was $44.2 million and $42.1 million, respectively. This is discussed in greater detail in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\nMillrose Spin-Off\nWe are currently preparing to spin off (the “Millrose Spin-Off”) a wholly owned subsidiary of Lennar, Millrose Properties Inc. (“Millrose”) into an independent, publicly traded company that will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, we plan to contribute to Millrose, in exchange for all outstanding shares of its common stock, a significant portion of our undeveloped, partially developed, and some of our fully developed, land, with an expected total aggregate value between $5.0 billion and $6.0 billion, as well as approximately $1.0 billion of cash. To consummate the Millrose Spin-Off, on January 10, 2025, our Board of Directors (\"Board\") declared a stock dividend, pursuant to which we will distribute to Lennar’s stockholders of record as of January 21, 2025 approximately 80% of the total outstanding number of shares of Millrose common stock on February 7, 2025. The goal of the Millrose Spin-off is to generally complete our migration to an asset-light operating model by spinning off a significant portion of our land assets from our balance sheet. We expect Millrose to qualify as a real estate investment trust that will acquire and develop land and will deliver fully developed homesites under a land option contract on a just in time basis for Lennar and potentially other homebuilders. Millrose is expected to maintain a business model with a self-sustaining, recycling source of land acquisition and development capital. Millrose is expected to be responsible for paying to develop the undeveloped and partially developed land into homesites up to a certain pre-negotiated budget, with Lennar  performing the actual construction work. Lennar will have options to purchase the homesites in accordance with pre-set takedown schedules when Lennar expects to be ready to build homes on them. Millrose is expected to use option exercise proceeds to purchase additional land designated by Lennar or other homebuilders in the future, usually giving Lennar or the other homebuilders options to purchase the land when it is developed.\nAs a result of the Millrose Spin-Off, both our inventory and our equity will be reduced by the amount of assets contributed to Millrose. However, our balance sheet will remain very strong after the Millrose Spin-Off and we expect to have ample funds with which to pay down debt, issue dividends and repurchase stock.\n4\nTable of \nContents\nMillrose has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-11 relating to the Millrose Spin-Off, which became effective on January 17, 2025. We expect that the Millrose Spin-Off will be completed by February 7, 2025, the distribution date of the Millrose common stock shares to Lennar’s stockholders, but there is no guarantee that the transaction will be completed on our anticipated timeline.\nPending Acquisition of Rausch Coleman Homes\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Rausch Coleman Homes, a residential homebuilder based in Fayetteville, Arkansas. With this acquisition, we will expand our footprint into new markets in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kansas and Missouri while adding to our existing footprint in Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama and Florida. As previously disclosed in Millrose’s registration statement on Form S-11, in connection with furthering our land light strategy, we intend to assign the purchase of Rausch Coleman's land assets (the “Rausch Land Assets”) to Millrose. Similar to the other land assets that Lennar expects to contribute to Millrose in connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, Lennar expects to enter into options to purchase the developed Rausch Land Assets in accordance with pre-set takedown schedules. We are expecting the acquisition to be completed in our first quarter of 2025.\nFinancial Services Operations\nResidential Mortgage Financing\nWe offer conforming conventional, FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loan products and other residential mortgage products primarily to buyers of our homes through our financial services subsidiary, Lennar Mortgage, from locations in most of the states in which we have homebuilding operations. In fiscal year 2024, our financial services subsidiaries provided loans to 84% of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing in areas where we offered services. Because of the availability of mortgage loans from our financial services subsidiaries, as well as from independent mortgage lenders, we believe almost all creditworthy potential purchasers of our homes have access to financing.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we originated approximately 54,600 residential mortgage loans totaling $19.8 billion, compared to 47,000 residential mortgage loans totaling $17.4 billion during fiscal year 2023. Substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, a majority of them on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Occasional claims of this type are a normal incident of loan securitization activities. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. During fiscal year 2024, we also locked interest rates on approximately 54,200 residential mortgage loans totaling $19.5 billion, compared to 46,600 residential mortgage loans totaling $17.2 billion during fiscal year 2023. \nWe finance our mortgage loan activities with borrowings under our financial services warehouse facilities or funds from our operating activities. At November 30, 2024, Financial Services had six warehouse residential facilities maturing at various dates through fiscal 2027 with a total maximum borrowing capacity of $3.1 billion including an uncommitted amount of $675 million. We expect the facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. If they are not renewed or replaced, we would have to find other sources of funding for our mortgage originations, which might include our own funds. We have a corporate risk management policy under which we hedge our interest rate risk on rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nWe have been using new technology to automate portions of our mortgage loan origination process. This new technology has made the mortgage financing process easier for homebuyers and improved the customer experience. This new technology has also enabled us to increase the number of digital closings, with digital document signing and, where legally permitted, digital notarization.\nTitle, Insurance and Closing Services\nWe are licensed to provide title insurance, and closing services for residential and/or commercial transactions in 41 states to our homebuyers and others. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we provided closing services with regard to approximately 82,400 and 74,900, real estate transactions, respectively, in 25 states.\nCommercial Mortgage Origination\nOur LMF Commercial subsidiary originates and sells into securitizations first mortgage loans, which are secured by income producing commercial properties. The loans generally are between $5 million and $50 million each. LMF Commercial also originates floating rate loans secured by commercial real estate properties, many of which are in transition, undergoing lease-up, sell-out, renovation or repositioning. In order to finance LMF Commercial lending activities, as of November 30, 2024, LMF Commercial had two warehouse repurchase financing agreements maturing at various dates from 2025 through \n5\nTable of \nContents\nfiscal 2026 with commitments totaling $300 million. This is discussed in greater detail in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\nLennar Other\nStrategic Technology Investments\nWe strategically invest in companies involved in technology initiatives that, among other things, help us enhance the homebuying or home ownership experience, reduce our SG&A expenses and help us stay at the forefront of homebuilding innovation. Six of the companies in which we have strategic investments are publicly traded. They are: \n•\nBlend Labs, Inc. (\"Blend\"), a digital lending platform developer simplifying and fast tracking the consumer finance process; \n•\nHippo Holdings, Inc. (\"Hippo\"), a company that provides an efficient means of obtaining home insurance;\n•\nOpendoor Technologies, Inc. (\"Opendoor\"), a company that uses technology to significantly streamline the homebuying and selling process;\n•\nSmartRent, Inc. (\"SmartRent\"), an enterprise smart home automation company;\n•\nSonder Holdings, Inc. (\"Sonder\"), a company that manages short-term rentals, such as rental hotels; and\n•\nSunnova Energy International, Inc. (\"Sunnova\"), a leading national residential solar company, to which during 2021, we sold our solar power business in return for equity.\nEach of the investments listed above is reflected in our financial statements at market value, with changes to the fair values of those investments generating gains or losses on our financial statements. At November 30, 2024, the book value of our investment in strategic technology investments was $587.1 million and is included in our Lennar Other segment.\nFor additional information about our investments in strategic technology investments, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report. \nMultifamily Operations\nOur Multifamily business has been engaged in the development of multifamily communities since 2011. Initially, the Multifamily business almost exclusively participated in shorter-duration joint ventures that built multifamily communities with the intention of selling them soon after they were built, and in most cases after they were substantially occupied. However, the Multifamily business now manages, and owns interests in, longer-duration funds that build multifamily communities with the intention of retaining them as rental income-generating assets. At November 30, 2024, Multifamily had interests in, and was managing, three funds and 23 joint ventures. \nFrom inception through November 30, 2024, the Multifamily business has capitalized and developed 123 multifamily residential communities with approximately 37,100 rental units across 20 states throughout the United States. The communities developed by the Multifamily business include a diversified mix of conventional garden, mid-rise and high-rise multifamily properties in urban and suburban locations near major employment centers. Most communities offer residents a mix of studio, one, two, and three-bedroom homes. \nAs of November 30, 2024, funds and ventures managed by Multifamily had a pipeline of 57 potential future developments, which were owned, under contract or subject to letters of intent, totaling approximately $6.5 billion in anticipated development costs across several states.\nMultifamily has co-investments in all the funds and ventures it manages, and receives returns on these investments. In addition, it has carried interests in the funds or ventures it manages, and receives distributions with regard to those carried interests. \nLennar Multifamily Venture Fund I (“LMV I\") is a long-term multifamily development investment vehicle involved in the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets. As of November 30, 2023, there were 38 rental operation projects in LMV I. During the second half of fiscal 2024, the LMV I partners decided to liquidate and sell all of the individual rental operation projects of LMV I as the fund has come to the end of its contractual life. During the year ended November 30, 2024, 33 LMV I rental operation projects were sold to various third-party buyers. We recognized a net gain of $211.5 million on the sale of these rental operation projects which was recorded as equity in earnings (losses) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and received net cash distributions of $199.5 million. The remaining LMV I rental operation projects are expected to be monetized in the near term.\nSingle-Family Home Rentals \nIn December 2020, Lennar formed the Upward America Venture, LLC (“Upward America”), which (a) acquires communities of single-family rental properties (including townhomes, duplexes and condominium buildings developed or \n6\nTable of \nContents\nacquired for rental purposes), and (b) leases and manages homes in those communities. Lennar subsidiaries are the manager and the general partner of Upward America. The investment period for Upward America closed in 2024, reducing the equity commitments from investors from $1.6 billion to $1.0 billion. As of November 30, 2024, institutional investors and Lennar had committed $1.0 billion to Upward America, part of which was used to reduce an initial commitment Lennar had made from $225 million to $78.1 million. Proceeds of commitments by other investors may be used to redeem more of Lennar’s ownership, but Lennar has agreed not to reduce its ownership below $50 million.\nAs owner of the general partner of Upward America, Lennar has the right to receive, in addition to distributions regarding its own commitments, distributions based on the amounts by which returns to limited partners exceed specified amounts (i.e., carried interests). As the manager of Upward America, Lennar receives management and acquisition fees. Lennar subsidiaries may also receive fees for property management, leasing, construction management and other services that they render through subcontractors. In April 2024, Upward America entered into a joint venture agreement and property management agreement with Invitation Homes. In addition, Lennar engaged Invitation Homes to provide certain asset management services for the Upward America Venture. \nAt November 30, 2024, Upward America had purchased 4,697 homes in 103 communities across 19 metropolitan statistical areas for a total purchase price of $1.2 billion (an average price of $258,000 per home) and disposed of 92 homes for a total sales price of $26.0 million (an average price of $283,000 per home). The Limited Partnership Agreement of Upward America gives Upward America the right to purchase from Lennar for their appraised value all homes or communities that are purpose built by Lennar for single-family home rental. Upward America also is free to purchase homes from homebuilders other than Lennar or to purchase previously occupied homes. Initially all the homes purchased by Upward America were purchased from Lennar, but subsequently, Upward America began purchasing homes from multiple homebuilders. At both November 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 6% of the homes owned by Upward America were built by homebuilders other than Lennar.\nFive Point Holdings, LLC\nWe own an indirect approximately 40% interest in FivePoint, which is a publicly traded developer of three large master planned mixed-use developments in California (Newhall Ranch, Great Park Neighborhoods, and San Francisco Shipyard/Candlestick Point). We sometimes purchase properties from FivePoint for use in our homebuilding operations. We have no active role in the management of FivePoint, except that since August 2021 our Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer has been the non-employee Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors (but not the chief executive officer) of FivePoint. As of November 30, 2024, the carrying amount of our investment in FivePoint was $470.8 million.\nRialto Fund Investments\nUntil November 30, 2018, we had a group of subsidiaries, including Rialto Capital Management, LLC (\"Rialto\"), that primarily managed real estate related investment funds and other real estate related investment vehicles. We sold the Rialto Management Group on November 30, 2018. However, we retained the right to share in carried interest distributions from some of the funds and other investment vehicles Rialto manages. We also retained limited partner investments in several Rialto funds and investment vehicles that totaled $140.1 million as of November 30, 2024.\nSeasonality\nWe historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second and third fiscal quarters and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, a variety of factors can alter seasonal patterns. In addition, we are working towards moving to a more even flow production where we start, sell and deliver a similar number of homes each quarter.\n7\nTable of \nContents\nCompetition\nThe residential homebuilding industry is highly competitive. In each of the market regions where we operate, we compete for homebuyers with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders, as well as with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market. We compete for homebuyers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including location, price, reputation for customer satisfaction, amenities, design, quality and financing. In addition to competition for homebuyers, we also compete with other homebuilders for desirable properties, raw materials and access to reliable, skilled labor. We compete with a wide variety of property owners in our efforts to sell land to homebuilders and others. We believe we are competitive in the market regions where we operate primarily due to our:\n•\nEverything’s Included\n®\n marketing program, which simplifies the homebuying experience by including the most desirable features as standard items;\n•\nInnovative home designs, such as our Next Gen\n®\n homes that provide both privacy and togetherness for multi-generational families or a home office to accommodate working from home;\n•\nInclusion of built-in Wi-Fi, solar power systems and advanced technology in many of our homes;\n•\nConsumer insight capabilities, which allow us to continually stay tapped into consumer preferences and feedback so we can continuously evolve and fine-tune our offerings, processes and communications for our customers; \n•\nFinancial position as a result of our ability to finance land purchases and development activities with operating revenues and corporate level unsecured borrowing;\n•\nAccess to land, particularly in land-constrained markets;\n•\nPricing to current market conditions;\n•\nCost efficiencies realized through our national purchasing programs and production of value-engineered homes;\n•\nQuality construction and home warranty programs, which are supported by a responsive customer care team; \n•\nOur builder of choice program through which we maximize the efficiency of our suppliers' dealing with us;\n•\nSize and scale in leading markets; \n•\nUse of digital channels to advertise homes; and\n•\nStrategic investments in technology initiatives through our LEN\nX \ninvestments in companies that help us enhance the homebuying and home ownership experience, and help us stay at the forefront of homebuilding innovation.\nOur residential financial services operations compete with other residential mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and brokers, banks, savings and loan associations, non-bank mortgage lenders and other financial institutions, in the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. Principal competitive factors include interest rates and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer. We compete with other title insurance agencies and underwriters for closing services and title insurance. Principal competitive factors include service and price.\nOur LMF Commercial subsidiary's commercial mortgage origination and sale business competes with a wide variety of banks and other lenders that offer small and mid-sized mortgage loans to commercial enterprises. Competition is based primarily on service, price and relationships with mortgage brokers and other referral sources. LMF Commercial is run by highly seasoned managers who have been originating and securitizing loans for over 30 years and benefit from long-standing relationships with referral sources, as well as being able to leverage Lennar's infrastructure facilities for rapid market entrances and analysis. We believe these factors give LMF Commercial an advantage over many of the lenders with which it competes. Additionally, we believe access to Lennar's local homebuilding teams provides LMF Commercial with a distinct advantage in its evaluation of real estate assets.\nIn each region where we develop and operate multifamily properties, there is competition for residents with other owners of residential real estate (whether for-rent or for-sale). In addition, when capital raising, we compete with a wide variety of other investment opportunities that are being marketed by other firms, related both to real estate and to a variety of other investment products. We also compete for developable land with other developers of real estate for a variety of uses. \nIn each region where our funds offer single-family homes for rent, there is competition for residents with other owners of residential real estate (whether for-rent or for-sale). In addition, in seeking investors to acquire interests in funds we form, we will be competing with a wide variety of investment opportunities, related both to real estate and to a variety of other investment products. Also, in seeking to acquire single-family homes that our funds can hold as rental properties, our funds will be competing with other persons who plan to hold them as rental properties as well as persons who might want to purchase those homes to live in them. \nRegulation\nThe residential communities and multifamily apartment developments that we build are subject to a large variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations relating to, among other things, zoning, construction permits \n8\nTable of \nContents\nor entitlements, construction materials, density, building design and property elevation, building codes and handling of waste. These include laws requiring the use of construction materials that reduce the need for energy-consuming heating and cooling systems. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and often increase construction costs. For example, the California Energy Commission has adopted a requirement that most newly built homes in California must have rooftop solar panels. In some instances, we must comply with laws that require commitments from us to provide roads and other offsite infrastructure, and may require them to be in place prior to the commencement of new home construction. These laws and regulations are usually administered by counties and municipalities and may result in fees and assessments or building moratoriums. In addition, many new development projects are subject to assessments for schools, parks, streets and highways and other public improvements, the costs of which can be substantial. Also, some governmental agencies are attempting to make homebuilders responsible for violations of wage and other labor laws by their subcontractors. \nResidential homebuilding and apartment development are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. These environmental laws include such subjects as storm water and surface water management, soil, groundwater and wetlands protection, subsurface conditions and air quality protection and enhancement. Environmental laws may result in delays in developing properties, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.\nOver the years, several cities and counties in which we have developments have submitted to voters \"slow growth\" initiatives and other ballot measures that could impact the affordability and availability of land suitable for residential development within those localities. Although many of these initiatives have been defeated, if similar initiatives were approved, residential construction by us and others within certain cities or counties could be seriously impacted.\nIn order to make it possible for some of our homebuyers to obtain FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgages, we must construct the homes they buy in compliance with regulations promulgated by those agencies. Various states have statutory disclosure requirements relating to the marketing and sale of new homes. These disclosure requirements vary widely from state-to-state. In some states, we are required to be registered as a licensed contractor and comply with applicable rules and regulations. In various states, our new home consultants are required to be registered as licensed real estate agents and to adhere to the laws governing the practices of real estate agents.\nOur mortgage and title subsidiaries must comply with applicable real estate, lending and insurance laws and regulations. The subsidiaries are licensed in the states in which they do business and must comply with laws and regulations in those states. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding capitalization, operating procedures, investments, lending and privacy disclosures, forms of policies and premiums. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains a number of requirements relating to mortgage lending and securitizations. These include, among others, minimum standards for lender practices, limitations on certain fees and a requirement that the originator of loans that are securitized retain a portion of the risk, either directly or by holding interests in the securitizations.\nSeveral federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances, including, but not limited to, the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\") and the Federal Trade Commission Act and comparable state statutes, regulate consumer debt collection activity. Although, for a variety of reasons, we may not be specifically subject to the FDCPA or to some state statutes that govern debt collectors, it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in our collection activities. To the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities, our failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to regulations promulgated by the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding residential mortgage loans.\nEnvironment\nWe are focused on creating environmentally sustainable products, and our purchasing power enables us to include green features in our homes. Each new home we build is healthier and more energy efficient, and has less impact on the environment, than prior generations of homes as a result of features like:\n•\nLow-VOC paint that reduces pollution with less odor and hazard;\n•  WaterSense® faucets that reduce water flow without sacrificing performance;\n•  Low-E windows that reduce infrared and ultraviolet light coming into the home, make homes cooler, and reduce damage to furnishing; and\n•  Energy Star® appliances that reduce energy consumption.\nIn addition, our home design and engineering work optimizes efficient use of building materials and reduces construction waste. \nWe also believe in the value of clean energy from solar power, which is why we formed our own captive solar power company in 2013. In 2021, we sold our SunStreet solar operations to Sunnova, a leading national residential solar company, in exchange for stock in the company. We consistently seek opportunities to integrate solar power where it provides great value for our homebuyers.\n \n9\nTable of \nContents\nHuman Capital Management\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion; Talent Management and Leadership Development\nOur associates (i.e., employees) are our most valuable asset, and we are committed to supporting each associate’s unique career journey. We were built on a culture of inclusivity and a conscious focus on the associate experience, bringing together the best talent to drive success as part of our “Lennar family.” We believe having an inclusive work environment, where everyone has a sense of belonging, not only drives engagement but fosters innovation, which is critical to driving growth. Our “Everyone’s Included” mantra relative to inclusion and diversity within our company anchors our unique culture.\nOur success starts and ends with having the best talent, and, as a result, we are focused on attracting, developing, engaging and retaining our associates. We understand the importance of balance, and offer associates a competitive and comprehensive benefits package, including paid parental leave and resources for whole-self well-being (physical, social, and financial).\nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to the health and safety of our associates and trade partners. We hired a full-time Chief Medical Officer in early 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our experienced teams adapted quickly to changes in safety protocols to protect our associates, trade partners and homebuyers, and we have continued these protocols even after the COVID-19 pandemic receded. We are also committed to worker safety and regulatory compliance, and among other things, require that office associates with oversight of construction and associates who work in the field take additional safety courses. Our Board and its Audit Committee regularly review the results of OSHA visits and other safety-related information\n \nto ensure that we are successfully managing and improving our safety program.\nEmployees and Labor Relations\nAlthough we subcontract the land development and construction aspects of our homebuilding activities, we are highly dependent on our skilled employees for critical aspects of what we do. That includes senior executives who are responsible for our operational strategies and for approving significant land acquisitions and other major investments we make. It also includes the people who head our homebuilding divisions and non-homebuilding segments. And it includes the many people who are involved in design, construction oversight, marketing and other aspects of our homebuilding business and in carrying out our other activities.\nAt November 30, 2024, we employed 13,265 individuals of whom 10,653 were involved in the Homebuilding operations, 2,066 were involved in the Financial Services operations and 546 were involved in the Multifamily operations, compared to November 30, 2023, when we employed 12,284 individuals of whom 9,622 were involved in the Homebuilding operations, 1,792 were involved in the Financial Services operations and 870 were involved in the Multifamily operations. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our associates. However, we subcontract many phases of our homebuilding operations and some of the subcontractors we use have employees who are represented by labor unions. We believe our overall relations with our workforce are healthy.\nWe are firmly committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees. Our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other legally protected status.  \nAvailable Information\nThis Report on Form 10-K and all other reports and amendments we file with or furnish to the SEC are publicly available free of charge on the investor relations section of the Lennar website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such materials with, or furnish them to, the SEC.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nof this Report.\nAbout Our Company \nOur company was founded as a local Miami homebuilder in 1954. We completed our initial public offering in 1971 and listed our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. During the 1980s and 1990s, we entered and expanded operations in a number of homebuilding markets, including California, Florida and Texas, through both organic growth and acquisitions, such as Pacific Greystone Corporation in 1997. In 2000, we acquired U.S. Home Corporation, which expanded our operations into New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota and Colorado and strengthened our position in other states. From 2002 through 2005, we acquired several regional homebuilders, which brought us into new markets and strengthened our position in several existing markets. From 2010 through 2013, we expanded our homebuilding operations into Georgia, Oregon, Washington and Tennessee. In 2017, we acquired WCI Communities, Inc., a homebuilder of luxury single-family and multifamily homes, including a small number of luxury high-rise tower units, in Florida. In 2018, we acquired CalAtlantic Group, Inc. (\"CalAtlantic\"), a major homebuilder which was building homes across the homebuilding spectrum, from entry level to luxury, in 43 metropolitan statistical areas spanning 19 states, and providing mortgage, title and escrow services.\nWe are focused on increasing efficiencies in our building process and reducing selling, general and administrative expenses by using technology and innovative strategies to reduce customer acquisition costs. Our construction playbook has three primary areas of focus: lowering construction costs, reducing cycle time and achieving even flow production. We have aimed to maintain strong operating margins by deferring home sale price commitments until construction costs are finalized to protect against cost escalations. We focus on executing our operating strategy to be a consistent and high-volume homebuilder with production pace in sync with sales pace while using our gross margin as a shock absorber. In addition, we are continuing our transition to a land light operating model by increasing the percentage of land we control through options or agreements but do not own, which reduces our years’ supply of owned homesites. In connection with this transition, we expect to spin off a significant portion of our land assets to Millrose (as defined below), as discussed further below under the caption “Homebuilding Operations – Millrose Spin-Off.”\nHomebuilding Operations\nOverview\nOur homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly through entities in which we have investments. New home deliveries, including deliveries from unconsolidated entities, were 80,210 in fiscal 2024, compared to 73,087 in fiscal 2023 and 66,399 in fiscal 2022. We primarily sell homes in communities targeted to first-time, move-up, active adult, and luxury homebuyers. The average sales price of a Lennar home varies depending on product and geographic location. For fiscal 2024, the average sales price, excluding deliveries from unconsolidated entities, was $423,000, compared to $446,000 in fiscal 2023 and $480,000 in fiscal 2022.\n1\nTable of \nContents\nWe operate primarily under the Lennar brand name. Our homebuilding mission is focused on the profitable development of residential communities. Key elements of our strategy include:\n•\nStrong Operating Margins -\n Our purchasing leverage combined with our focus on reducing selling, general and administrative costs by using technology and innovative strategies and reducing interest expense through paydowns of debt has enabled us to achieve strong gross profit and operating margins. \n•\nEverything’s Included\n®\n Approach\n - We are focused on distinguishing our products, including through our Everything’s Included\n®\n approach, which maximizes our purchasing power, enables us to include luxury features as standard items in our homes and simplifies our homebuilding operations. \n•\nInnovative Homebuilding -\n We are constantly innovating the homes we build to create products that better meet our customers' needs and desires. Our Next Gen\n®\n home provides what can be a home within a home to accommodate children or parents or can be an office from which to work remotely. \n•\nCore Plans\n - We are integrating standardized, highly efficient, value engineered Plan series across all divisions at different price points. The Core Plans are driving cost savings and strong operating margins, while delivering great value for our homebuyers.\n•\nFlexible Operating Structure\n - Our local operating structure gives us the flexibility to make operating decisions based on local homebuilding conditions and customer preferences, while our centralized management structure provides strategic oversight for our homebuilding operations.\n•\nDigital Marketing \n- We are increasingly advertising homes through digital channels, which is significantly increasing the cost effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\n•\nDynamic pricing model\n - We match up unsold production as homes progress toward completion, with pricing information from our dynamic pricing model on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis.\n•\nTechnology Focused \n- We partner with and/or invest in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industries to increase efficiencies, reduce customer acquisition costs and create a better customer experience.\n•\nLand light strategy \n- We are focused on reducing our years' supply of owned homesites and increasing the percentage of land we control through options or agreements, including agreements with strategic land banks and joint ventures, rather than ownership. In connection with this strategy, we expect to spin off a significant portion of our land assets to Millrose, as discussed further below under the caption “Homebuilding Operations – Millrose Spin-Off.”\n•\nEven flow production\n - We adjust prices, with our gross margin being a shock absorber, in an effort to maintain consistent starts and sales paces in order to generate increased market share in all the markets we build in.\nDiversified Program of Property Acquisition\nWe generally acquire, or obtain options to acquire, land for development and for the construction of homes that we sell to homebuyers. Land purchases are subject to specified underwriting criteria and are made through our diversified program of property acquisition, which may consist of:\n•\nAcquiring land through option contracts, which generally enables us to control portions of properties owned by land banks and other third parties or entities in which we have investments until we have determined whether to exercise the options;\n•\nAcquiring land directly from individual land owners/developers, or other homebuilders;\n•\nAcquiring local or regional homebuilders that own, or have options to purchase, land in strategic markets;\n•\nAcquiring access to land through joint ventures or partnerships, which among other benefits, limits the amount of our capital invested in land while helping to ensure our access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures;\n•\nInvesting in regional developers in exchange for preferential land purchase opportunities; and\n•\nAcquiring land in conjunction with our Multifamily business.\nFor the last several years, we have been reducing our reliance on land we own and increasing our access to land through options and joint ventures, most significantly through our use of land banks which is a critical part of our operating strategy. At November 30, 2024, 82% of our total homesites were controlled through options with land banks, land sellers and joint ventures compared to 76% at November 30, 2023. For additional information about our investments in and relationships with unconsolidated entities, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\n2\nTable of \nContents\nConstruction and Development\nWe are involved in all phases of planning and building in our residential communities, including land acquisition, site planning, preparation and improvement of land and design, construction and marketing of homes. We use independent subcontractors for most aspects of land development and home construction. At November 30, 2024, we were actively building and marketing homes in 1,447 communities, including 11 communities being constructed by unconsolidated entities. This was an increase from the 1,260 communities, including five communities being constructed by unconsolidated entities, in which we were actively building and marketing homes at November 30, 2023. At November 30, 2024 and 2023, we had about 2,900 and 1,200 completed unsold homes, respectively.\nWe generally supervise and control the development of land and the design and building of our residential communities with a relatively small labor force. We hire subcontractors for site improvements and virtually all of the work involved in the construction of homes. Arrangements with our subcontractors generally provide that our subcontractors will complete specified work in accordance with price and time schedules and in compliance with applicable building codes and laws. The price schedules may be subject to change to meet changes in labor and material costs or for other reasons. Although we, like homebuilders throughout the country, encountered shortages of materials and skilled labor during 2022, we believe that because of our size and our builder of choice program, where we work with our trade partners to drive efficiencies for them, we were less affected by these shortages than many of our competitors. Most shortages were eliminated due to the supply chain environment catching up to homebuilder demand as well as Lennar’s continued effort to work with our suppliers and manufacturers on the volume and specific products needed to build homes. We generally do not own heavy construction equipment. We finance construction and land development activities primarily with cash generated from operations and historically from proceeds of unsecured corporate debt. Following the Millrose Spin-Off, we expect that, when Millrose acquires undeveloped or partially developed land that we have options to purchase, Millrose will finance the horizontal development of all such homesites up to pre-negotiated development budgets, which will be incorporated into the takedown prices for Lennar’s purchase options on the properties.\nMarketing\nWe offer a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up, active adult, luxury and multi-generational homebuyers in a variety of locations ranging from urban infill communities to suburban golf course communities. Our Everything’s Included\n® \nmarketing program enables us to differentiate our homes from those of our competitors by including luxury items as standard features at competitive prices, while reducing construction and overhead costs through a simplified construction process, product standardization and volume purchasing. In addition, we include built in wireless capability, home automation and solar power in many of the homes we sell, which enhances our brand and improves our ability to generate traffic and sales.\nWe sell our homes from models that we have designed and constructed. We employ new home consultants who are paid salaries, commissions or both to conduct on-site sales of our homes. We also sell homes through independent realtors. We have made it possible for potential homebuyers to take virtual tours of model homes. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, even with shifts in macroeconomic factors and adjusting to an inflationary environment in much of the period, we were able to develop, enhance, use, and improve the Lennar machine. Our sales, marketing, and dynamic pricing machine is quickly becoming an advanced digital engine that has materially benefited from aggressive, focused use and engagement while the market was most difficult.\nOur marketing strategy has increasingly involved advertising through digital channels including real estate listing sites, paid search, display advertising, social media and e-mail marketing, all of which drive traffic to our website, www.lennar.com. This has allowed us to attract more qualified and knowledgeable homebuyers. However, we also continue to advertise through more traditional media on a limited basis, including newspapers, other local and regional publications, radio and on billboards where appropriate. We tailor our marketing strategy and message based on the community being advertised and the customers being targeted, such as advertising our active adult communities in areas where prospective active adult homebuyers live or will potentially want to purchase. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, increased interest rates as compared to prior years have made our homes less affordable to many prospective buyers and led us to reduce prices or increase sales incentives in a number of our communities to maintain sales pace.\nQuality Service\nWe continually strive to improve homeowner customer satisfaction throughout the pre-sale, sale, construction, closing and post-closing periods. We strive to create a quality homebuying experience for our customers through the participation of sales associates, on-site construction supervisors and customer care associates, all working in a team effort, as well as use of technology to simplify the homebuying and financing process. We believe this leads to enhanced customer retention and referrals. The quality of our homes is substantially affected by the efforts of on-site management and others engaged in the construction process, by the materials we use in particular homes, and by other similar factors.\n3\nTable of \nContents\nWe warrant our new homes against defective materials and workmanship for a minimum period of one year after the date of closing. Although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to the homebuyers for the correction of any deficiencies.\nLocal Operating Structure and Centralized Management\nWe balance a local operating structure with centralized corporate level management. Our local operating structure consists of homebuilding divisions across the country, each of which is usually managed by a division president, a controller and personnel focused on land acquisition, entitlement and development, sales, construction, customer service and purchasing. This local operating structure gives our division presidents and their teams, who generally have significant experience in the homebuilding industry, and in most instances, in their particular markets, the flexibility to make local operating decisions, including land identification, entitlement and development, the management of inventory levels for our current sales volume, community development, home design, construction and marketing of our homes. We centralize at the corporate level decisions related to our overall strategy, acquisitions and disposition of land and businesses, risk management, financing, cash management and information systems.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced a cancellation rate of 14% in 2024 and 16% in 2023. We do not recognize revenue on homes that are the subject of sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. \nThe backlog dollar value including unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2024 was $5.4 billion, compared to $6.6 billion at November 30, 2023. We expect that a significant portion of all homes currently in backlog will be delivered in fiscal year 2025.\nHomebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWe create and participate in joint ventures that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations, for sale to third parties or for use in the ventures' own homebuilding operations. Through these joint ventures, we reduce the amount we invest in potential future homesites, thereby reducing risks associated with land acquisitions and improving the return on our investments, and, in some instances, we obtain access to land to which we could not otherwise have obtained access or could not have obtained access on as favorable terms. As of both November 30, 2024 and 2023, we had equity investments in 51 active homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities, in which we were participating, and our maximum recourse debt exposure related to Homebuilding unconsolidated joint ventures was $44.2 million and $42.1 million, respectively. This is discussed in greater detail in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\nMillrose Spin-Off\nWe are currently preparing to spin off (the “Millrose Spin-Off”) a wholly owned subsidiary of Lennar, Millrose Properties Inc. (“Millrose”) into an independent, publicly traded company that will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, we plan to contribute to Millrose, in exchange for all outstanding shares of its common stock, a significant portion of our undeveloped, partially developed, and some of our fully developed, land, with an expected total aggregate value between $5.0 billion and $6.0 billion, as well as approximately $1.0 billion of cash. To consummate the Millrose Spin-Off, on January 10, 2025, our Board of Directors (\"Board\") declared a stock dividend, pursuant to which we will distribute to Lennar’s stockholders of record as of January 21, 2025 approximately 80% of the total outstanding number of shares of Millrose common stock on February 7, 2025. The goal of the Millrose Spin-off is to generally complete our migration to an asset-light operating model by spinning off a significant portion of our land assets from our balance sheet. We expect Millrose to qualify as a real estate investment trust that will acquire and develop land and will deliver fully developed homesites under a land option contract on a just in time basis for Lennar and potentially other homebuilders. Millrose is expected to maintain a business model with a self-sustaining, recycling source of land acquisition and development capital. Millrose is expected to be responsible for paying to develop the undeveloped and partially developed land into homesites up to a certain pre-negotiated budget, with Lennar  performing the actual construction work. Lennar will have options to purchase the homesites in accordance with pre-set takedown schedules when Lennar expects to be ready to build homes on them. Millrose is expected to use option exercise proceeds to purchase additional land designated by Lennar or other homebuilders in the future, usually giving Lennar or the other homebuilders options to purchase the land when it is developed.\nAs a result of the Millrose Spin-Off, both our inventory and our equity will be reduced by the amount of assets contributed to Millrose. However, our balance sheet will remain very strong after the Millrose Spin-Off and we expect to have ample funds with which to pay down debt, issue dividends and repurchase stock.\n4\nTable of \nContents\nMillrose has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-11 relating to the Millrose Spin-Off, which became effective on January 17, 2025. We expect that the Millrose Spin-Off will be completed by February 7, 2025, the distribution date of the Millrose common stock shares to Lennar’s stockholders, but there is no guarantee that the transaction will be completed on our anticipated timeline.\nPending Acquisition of Rausch Coleman Homes\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Rausch Coleman Homes, a residential homebuilder based in Fayetteville, Arkansas. With this acquisition, we will expand our footprint into new markets in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kansas and Missouri while adding to our existing footprint in Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama and Florida. As previously disclosed in Millrose’s registration statement on Form S-11, in connection with furthering our land light strategy, we intend to assign the purchase of Rausch Coleman's land assets (the “Rausch Land Assets”) to Millrose. Similar to the other land assets that Lennar expects to contribute to Millrose in connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, Lennar expects to enter into options to purchase the developed Rausch Land Assets in accordance with pre-set takedown schedules. We are expecting the acquisition to be completed in our first quarter of 2025.\nFinancial Services Operations\nResidential Mortgage Financing\nWe offer conforming conventional, FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loan products and other residential mortgage products primarily to buyers of our homes through our financial services subsidiary, Lennar Mortgage, from locations in most of the states in which we have homebuilding operations. In fiscal year 2024, our financial services subsidiaries provided loans to 84% of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing in areas where we offered services. Because of the availability of mortgage loans from our financial services subsidiaries, as well as from independent mortgage lenders, we believe almost all creditworthy potential purchasers of our homes have access to financing.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we originated approximately 54,600 residential mortgage loans totaling $19.8 billion, compared to 47,000 residential mortgage loans totaling $17.4 billion during fiscal year 2023. Substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, a majority of them on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Occasional claims of this type are a normal incident of loan securitization activities. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. During fiscal year 2024, we also locked interest rates on approximately 54,200 residential mortgage loans totaling $19.5 billion, compared to 46,600 residential mortgage loans totaling $17.2 billion during fiscal year 2023. \nWe finance our mortgage loan activities with borrowings under our financial services warehouse facilities or funds from our operating activities. At November 30, 2024, Financial Services had six warehouse residential facilities maturing at various dates through fiscal 2027 with a total maximum borrowing capacity of $3.1 billion including an uncommitted amount of $675 million. We expect the facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. If they are not renewed or replaced, we would have to find other sources of funding for our mortgage originations, which might include our own funds. We have a corporate risk management policy under which we hedge our interest rate risk on rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nWe have been using new technology to automate portions of our mortgage loan origination process. This new technology has made the mortgage financing process easier for homebuyers and improved the customer experience. This new technology has also enabled us to increase the number of digital closings, with digital document signing and, where legally permitted, digital notarization.\nTitle, Insurance and Closing Services\nWe are licensed to provide title insurance, and closing services for residential and/or commercial transactions in 41 states to our homebuyers and others. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we provided closing services with regard to approximately 82,400 and 74,900, real estate transactions, respectively, in 25 states.\nCommercial Mortgage Origination\nOur LMF Commercial subsidiary originates and sells into securitizations first mortgage loans, which are secured by income producing commercial properties. The loans generally are between $5 million and $50 million each. LMF Commercial also originates floating rate loans secured by commercial real estate properties, many of which are in transition, undergoing lease-up, sell-out, renovation or repositioning. In order to finance LMF Commercial lending activities, as of November 30, 2024, LMF Commercial had two warehouse repurchase financing agreements maturing at various dates from 2025 through \n5\nTable of \nContents\nfiscal 2026 with commitments totaling $300 million. This is discussed in greater detail in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\nLennar Other\nStrategic Technology Investments\nWe strategically invest in companies involved in technology initiatives that, among other things, help us enhance the homebuying or home ownership experience, reduce our SG&A expenses and help us stay at the forefront of homebuilding innovation. Six of the companies in which we have strategic investments are publicly traded. They are: \n•\nBlend Labs, Inc. (\"Blend\"), a digital lending platform developer simplifying and fast tracking the consumer finance process; \n•\nHippo Holdings, Inc. (\"Hippo\"), a company that provides an efficient means of obtaining home insurance;\n•\nOpendoor Technologies, Inc. (\"Opendoor\"), a company that uses technology to significantly streamline the homebuying and selling process;\n•\nSmartRent, Inc. (\"SmartRent\"), an enterprise smart home automation company;\n•\nSonder Holdings, Inc. (\"Sonder\"), a company that manages short-term rentals, such as rental hotels; and\n•\nSunnova Energy International, Inc. (\"Sunnova\"), a leading national residential solar company, to which during 2021, we sold our solar power business in return for equity.\nEach of the investments listed above is reflected in our financial statements at market value, with changes to the fair values of those investments generating gains or losses on our financial statements. At November 30, 2024, the book value of our investment in strategic technology investments was $587.1 million and is included in our Lennar Other segment.\nFor additional information about our investments in strategic technology investments, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report. \nMultifamily Operations\nOur Multifamily business has been engaged in the development of multifamily communities since 2011. Initially, the Multifamily business almost exclusively participated in shorter-duration joint ventures that built multifamily communities with the intention of selling them soon after they were built, and in most cases after they were substantially occupied. However, the Multifamily business now manages, and owns interests in, longer-duration funds that build multifamily communities with the intention of retaining them as rental income-generating assets. At November 30, 2024, Multifamily had interests in, and was managing, three funds and 23 joint ventures. \nFrom inception through November 30, 2024, the Multifamily business has capitalized and developed 123 multifamily residential communities with approximately 37,100 rental units across 20 states throughout the United States. The communities developed by the Multifamily business include a diversified mix of conventional garden, mid-rise and high-rise multifamily properties in urban and suburban locations near major employment centers. Most communities offer residents a mix of studio, one, two, and three-bedroom homes. \nAs of November 30, 2024, funds and ventures managed by Multifamily had a pipeline of 57 potential future developments, which were owned, under contract or subject to letters of intent, totaling approximately $6.5 billion in anticipated development costs across several states.\nMultifamily has co-investments in all the funds and ventures it manages, and receives returns on these investments. In addition, it has carried interests in the funds or ventures it manages, and receives distributions with regard to those carried interests. \nLennar Multifamily Venture Fund I (“LMV I\") is a long-term multifamily development investment vehicle involved in the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets. As of November 30, 2023, there were 38 rental operation projects in LMV I. During the second half of fiscal 2024, the LMV I partners decided to liquidate and sell all of the individual rental operation projects of LMV I as the fund has come to the end of its contractual life. During the year ended November 30, 2024, 33 LMV I rental operation projects were sold to various third-party buyers. We recognized a net gain of $211.5 million on the sale of these rental operation projects which was recorded as equity in earnings (losses) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and received net cash distributions of $199.5 million. The remaining LMV I rental operation projects are expected to be monetized in the near term.\nSingle-Family Home Rentals \nIn December 2020, Lennar formed the Upward America Venture, LLC (“Upward America”), which (a) acquires communities of single-family rental properties (including townhomes, duplexes and condominium buildings developed or \n6\nTable of \nContents\nacquired for rental purposes), and (b) leases and manages homes in those communities. Lennar subsidiaries are the manager and the general partner of Upward America. The investment period for Upward America closed in 2024, reducing the equity commitments from investors from $1.6 billion to $1.0 billion. As of November 30, 2024, institutional investors and Lennar had committed $1.0 billion to Upward America, part of which was used to reduce an initial commitment Lennar had made from $225 million to $78.1 million. Proceeds of commitments by other investors may be used to redeem more of Lennar’s ownership, but Lennar has agreed not to reduce its ownership below $50 million.\nAs owner of the general partner of Upward America, Lennar has the right to receive, in addition to distributions regarding its own commitments, distributions based on the amounts by which returns to limited partners exceed specified amounts (i.e., carried interests). As the manager of Upward America, Lennar receives management and acquisition fees. Lennar subsidiaries may also receive fees for property management, leasing, construction management and other services that they render through subcontractors. In April 2024, Upward America entered into a joint venture agreement and property management agreement with Invitation Homes. In addition, Lennar engaged Invitation Homes to provide certain asset management services for the Upward America Venture. \nAt November 30, 2024, Upward America had purchased 4,697 homes in 103 communities across 19 metropolitan statistical areas for a total purchase price of $1.2 billion (an average price of $258,000 per home) and disposed of 92 homes for a total sales price of $26.0 million (an average price of $283,000 per home). The Limited Partnership Agreement of Upward America gives Upward America the right to purchase from Lennar for their appraised value all homes or communities that are purpose built by Lennar for single-family home rental. Upward America also is free to purchase homes from homebuilders other than Lennar or to purchase previously occupied homes. Initially all the homes purchased by Upward America were purchased from Lennar, but subsequently, Upward America began purchasing homes from multiple homebuilders. At both November 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 6% of the homes owned by Upward America were built by homebuilders other than Lennar.\nFive Point Holdings, LLC\nWe own an indirect approximately 40% interest in FivePoint, which is a publicly traded developer of three large master planned mixed-use developments in California (Newhall Ranch, Great Park Neighborhoods, and San Francisco Shipyard/Candlestick Point). We sometimes purchase properties from FivePoint for use in our homebuilding operations. We have no active role in the management of FivePoint, except that since August 2021 our Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer has been the non-employee Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors (but not the chief executive officer) of FivePoint. As of November 30, 2024, the carrying amount of our investment in FivePoint was $470.8 million.\nRialto Fund Investments\nUntil November 30, 2018, we had a group of subsidiaries, including Rialto Capital Management, LLC (\"Rialto\"), that primarily managed real estate related investment funds and other real estate related investment vehicles. We sold the Rialto Management Group on November 30, 2018. However, we retained the right to share in carried interest distributions from some of the funds and other investment vehicles Rialto manages. We also retained limited partner investments in several Rialto funds and investment vehicles that totaled $140.1 million as of November 30, 2024.\nSeasonality\nWe historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second and third fiscal quarters and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, a variety of factors can alter seasonal patterns. In addition, we are working towards moving to a more even flow production where we start, sell and deliver a similar number of homes each quarter.\n7\nTable of \nContents\nCompetition\nThe residential homebuilding industry is highly competitive. In each of the market regions where we operate, we compete for homebuyers with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders, as well as with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market. We compete for homebuyers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including location, price, reputation for customer satisfaction, amenities, design, quality and financing. In addition to competition for homebuyers, we also compete with other homebuilders for desirable properties, raw materials and access to reliable, skilled labor. We compete with a wide variety of property owners in our efforts to sell land to homebuilders and others. We believe we are competitive in the market regions where we operate primarily due to our:\n•\nEverything’s Included\n®\n marketing program, which simplifies the homebuying experience by including the most desirable features as standard items;\n•\nInnovative home designs, such as our Next Gen\n®\n homes that provide both privacy and togetherness for multi-generational families or a home office to accommodate working from home;\n•\nInclusion of built-in Wi-Fi, solar power systems and advanced technology in many of our homes;\n•\nConsumer insight capabilities, which allow us to continually stay tapped into consumer preferences and feedback so we can continuously evolve and fine-tune our offerings, processes and communications for our customers; \n•\nFinancial position as a result of our ability to finance land purchases and development activities with operating revenues and corporate level unsecured borrowing;\n•\nAccess to land, particularly in land-constrained markets;\n•\nPricing to current market conditions;\n•\nCost efficiencies realized through our national purchasing programs and production of value-engineered homes;\n•\nQuality construction and home warranty programs, which are supported by a responsive customer care team; \n•\nOur builder of choice program through which we maximize the efficiency of our suppliers' dealing with us;\n•\nSize and scale in leading markets; \n•\nUse of digital channels to advertise homes; and\n•\nStrategic investments in technology initiatives through our LEN\nX \ninvestments in companies that help us enhance the homebuying and home ownership experience, and help us stay at the forefront of homebuilding innovation.\nOur residential financial services operations compete with other residential mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and brokers, banks, savings and loan associations, non-bank mortgage lenders and other financial institutions, in the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. Principal competitive factors include interest rates and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer. We compete with other title insurance agencies and underwriters for closing services and title insurance. Principal competitive factors include service and price.\nOur LMF Commercial subsidiary's commercial mortgage origination and sale business competes with a wide variety of banks and other lenders that offer small and mid-sized mortgage loans to commercial enterprises. Competition is based primarily on service, price and relationships with mortgage brokers and other referral sources. LMF Commercial is run by highly seasoned managers who have been originating and securitizing loans for over 30 years and benefit from long-standing relationships with referral sources, as well as being able to leverage Lennar's infrastructure facilities for rapid market entrances and analysis. We believe these factors give LMF Commercial an advantage over many of the lenders with which it competes. Additionally, we believe access to Lennar's local homebuilding teams provides LMF Commercial with a distinct advantage in its evaluation of real estate assets.\nIn each region where we develop and operate multifamily properties, there is competition for residents with other owners of residential real estate (whether for-rent or for-sale). In addition, when capital raising, we compete with a wide variety of other investment opportunities that are being marketed by other firms, related both to real estate and to a variety of other investment products. We also compete for developable land with other developers of real estate for a variety of uses. \nIn each region where our funds offer single-family homes for rent, there is competition for residents with other owners of residential real estate (whether for-rent or for-sale). In addition, in seeking investors to acquire interests in funds we form, we will be competing with a wide variety of investment opportunities, related both to real estate and to a variety of other investment products. Also, in seeking to acquire single-family homes that our funds can hold as rental properties, our funds will be competing with other persons who plan to hold them as rental properties as well as persons who might want to purchase those homes to live in them. \nRegulation\nThe residential communities and multifamily apartment developments that we build are subject to a large variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations relating to, among other things, zoning, construction permits \n8\nTable of \nContents\nor entitlements, construction materials, density, building design and property elevation, building codes and handling of waste. These include laws requiring the use of construction materials that reduce the need for energy-consuming heating and cooling systems. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and often increase construction costs. For example, the California Energy Commission has adopted a requirement that most newly built homes in California must have rooftop solar panels. In some instances, we must comply with laws that require commitments from us to provide roads and other offsite infrastructure, and may require them to be in place prior to the commencement of new home construction. These laws and regulations are usually administered by counties and municipalities and may result in fees and assessments or building moratoriums. In addition, many new development projects are subject to assessments for schools, parks, streets and highways and other public improvements, the costs of which can be substantial. Also, some governmental agencies are attempting to make homebuilders responsible for violations of wage and other labor laws by their subcontractors. \nResidential homebuilding and apartment development are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. These environmental laws include such subjects as storm water and surface water management, soil, groundwater and wetlands protection, subsurface conditions and air quality protection and enhancement. Environmental laws may result in delays in developing properties, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.\nOver the years, several cities and counties in which we have developments have submitted to voters \"slow growth\" initiatives and other ballot measures that could impact the affordability and availability of land suitable for residential development within those localities. Although many of these initiatives have been defeated, if similar initiatives were approved, residential construction by us and others within certain cities or counties could be seriously impacted.\nIn order to make it possible for some of our homebuyers to obtain FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgages, we must construct the homes they buy in compliance with regulations promulgated by those agencies. Various states have statutory disclosure requirements relating to the marketing and sale of new homes. These disclosure requirements vary widely from state-to-state. In some states, we are required to be registered as a licensed contractor and comply with applicable rules and regulations. In various states, our new home consultants are required to be registered as licensed real estate agents and to adhere to the laws governing the practices of real estate agents.\nOur mortgage and title subsidiaries must comply with applicable real estate, lending and insurance laws and regulations. The subsidiaries are licensed in the states in which they do business and must comply with laws and regulations in those states. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding capitalization, operating procedures, investments, lending and privacy disclosures, forms of policies and premiums. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains a number of requirements relating to mortgage lending and securitizations. These include, among others, minimum standards for lender practices, limitations on certain fees and a requirement that the originator of loans that are securitized retain a portion of the risk, either directly or by holding interests in the securitizations.\nSeveral federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances, including, but not limited to, the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\") and the Federal Trade Commission Act and comparable state statutes, regulate consumer debt collection activity. Although, for a variety of reasons, we may not be specifically subject to the FDCPA or to some state statutes that govern debt collectors, it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in our collection activities. To the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities, our failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to regulations promulgated by the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding residential mortgage loans.\nEnvironment\nWe are focused on creating environmentally sustainable products, and our purchasing power enables us to include green features in our homes. Each new home we build is healthier and more energy efficient, and has less impact on the environment, than prior generations of homes as a result of features like:\n•\nLow-VOC paint that reduces pollution with less odor and hazard;\n•  WaterSense® faucets that reduce water flow without sacrificing performance;\n•  Low-E windows that reduce infrared and ultraviolet light coming into the home, make homes cooler, and reduce damage to furnishing; and\n•  Energy Star® appliances that reduce energy consumption.\nIn addition, our home design and engineering work optimizes efficient use of building materials and reduces construction waste. \nWe also believe in the value of clean energy from solar power, which is why we formed our own captive solar power company in 2013. In 2021, we sold our SunStreet solar operations to Sunnova, a leading national residential solar company, in exchange for stock in the company. We consistently seek opportunities to integrate solar power where it provides great value for our homebuyers.\n \n9\nTable of \nContents\nHuman Capital Management\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion; Talent Management and Leadership Development\nOur associates (i.e., employees) are our most valuable asset, and we are committed to supporting each associate’s unique career journey. We were built on a culture of inclusivity and a conscious focus on the associate experience, bringing together the best talent to drive success as part of our “Lennar family.” We believe having an inclusive work environment, where everyone has a sense of belonging, not only drives engagement but fosters innovation, which is critical to driving growth. Our “Everyone’s Included” mantra relative to inclusion and diversity within our company anchors our unique culture.\nOur success starts and ends with having the best talent, and, as a result, we are focused on attracting, developing, engaging and retaining our associates. We understand the importance of balance, and offer associates a competitive and comprehensive benefits package, including paid parental leave and resources for whole-self well-being (physical, social, and financial).\nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to the health and safety of our associates and trade partners. We hired a full-time Chief Medical Officer in early 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our experienced teams adapted quickly to changes in safety protocols to protect our associates, trade partners and homebuyers, and we have continued these protocols even after the COVID-19 pandemic receded. We are also committed to worker safety and regulatory compliance, and among other things, require that office associates with oversight of construction and associates who work in the field take additional safety courses. Our Board and its Audit Committee regularly review the results of OSHA visits and other safety-related information\n \nto ensure that we are successfully managing and improving our safety program.\nEmployees and Labor Relations\nAlthough we subcontract the land development and construction aspects of our homebuilding activities, we are highly dependent on our skilled employees for critical aspects of what we do. That includes senior executives who are responsible for our operational strategies and for approving significant land acquisitions and other major investments we make. It also includes the people who head our homebuilding divisions and non-homebuilding segments. And it includes the many people who are involved in design, construction oversight, marketing and other aspects of our homebuilding business and in carrying out our other activities.\nAt November 30, 2024, we employed 13,265 individuals of whom 10,653 were involved in the Homebuilding operations, 2,066 were involved in the Financial Services operations and 546 were involved in the Multifamily operations, compared to November 30, 2023, when we employed 12,284 individuals of whom 9,622 were involved in the Homebuilding operations, 1,792 were involved in the Financial Services operations and 870 were involved in the Multifamily operations. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our associates. However, we subcontract many phases of our homebuilding operations and some of the subcontractors we use have employees who are represented by labor unions. We believe our overall relations with our workforce are healthy.\nWe are firmly committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees. Our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other legally protected status.  \nAvailable Information\nThis Report on Form 10-K and all other reports and amendments we file with or furnish to the SEC are publicly available free of charge on the investor relations section of the Lennar website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such materials with, or furnish them to, the SEC.

These statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements typically include the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “consider,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “objective,” “plan,” “predict,” “projection,” “seek,” “strategy,” “target,” “will”, \"may\" or other words of similar meaning. Some of them are opinions formed based upon general observations, anecdotal evidence and industry experience, but that are not supported by specific investigation or analysis.\n10\nTable of \nContents\nThese forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from what is anticipated by our forward-looking statements. The most important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: slowdowns in real estate markets in regions where we have significant Homebuilding or Multifamily development activities or own a substantial number of single-family homes for rent; decreased demand for our homes, either for sale or for rent, or Multifamily rental apartments; the potential impact of inflation; the impact of increased cost of mortgage financing for homebuyers, increased or continued high interest rates or increased competition in the mortgage industry; supply shortages and increased costs related to construction materials and labor; the possibility that increased tariffs will increase the cost of production materials; cost increases related to real estate taxes and insurance; the effect of increased interest rates with regard to our funds' borrowings on the willingness of the funds to invest in new projects; reductions in the market value of the Company's investments in public companies; natural disasters or catastrophic events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; our inability to successfully execute our strategies, including our land lighter strategy and our planned spin-off; problems exercising options to purchase homesites; a decline in the value of the land and home inventories we maintain and resulting possible future write downs of the carrying value of our real estate assets; the forfeiture of deposits related to land purchase options we decide not to exercise; the potential negative impact to our business of public health issues; possible unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings; changes in general economic and financial conditions that reduce demand for our products and services, lower our profit margins or reduce our access to credit; our inability to acquire land at anticipated prices; the possibility that we will incur nonrecurring costs that affect earnings in one or more reporting periods; the possibility that the benefit from our increasing use of technology will not justify its cost; increased competition for home sales from other sellers of new and resale homes; becoming unable to pay down debt; government actions or other factors that might force us to terminate our program of repurchasing our stock; the failure of the participants in various joint ventures to honor their commitments; difficulty obtaining land-use entitlements or construction financing; harm to our business from information technology failures and data security breaches; new laws or regulatory changes that adversely affect the profitability of our businesses (including changes in tax laws or liabilities); our inability to refinance our debt on terms that are as favorable as our current arrangements; and changes in accounting conventions that adversely affect our reported earnings.\nPlease see \nItem 1A-Risk Factors \nand\n Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations\n of this Report for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties which could affect our future results. We undertake no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, except to the extent we are legally required to disclose certain matters in SEC filings or otherwise.\nItem 1A.    Risk Factors.\nThe following risks, which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this Report, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMarket and Economic Risks\nDemand for homes we build may be adversely affected by a variety of macroeconomic factors beyond our control.\nDemand for our homes is dependent on a variety of macroeconomic factors, such as employment levels, inflation, interest rates, changes in stock market valuations, consumer confidence, consumer income, housing demand, availability and cost of financing for homebuyers, availability and prices of new homes compared to those of previously occupied homes, and demographic trends. These factors can be significantly adversely affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. Currently, potential purchasers of our homes are being affected by inflation and continued high interest rates, both of which increase what homebuyers have to pay for new homes.\nNegative publicity could hurt our reputation, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nOur business success is dependent upon the reputation of the Lennar brand and its association with quality and integrity. If we are unable to maintain the position of the Lennar brand, our business may be adversely affected, which could result in lower sales and earnings. Unfavorable media or investor and analyst reports related to our industry, company, brand, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. We could be subject to knowingly false statements made for the purpose of impairing our reputation.\n \nThese statements, even if totally untrue, can spread rapidly through the use of electronic communication, including social media outlets, websites and other digital platforms. Our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary from media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes, which would adversely affect our business.\n11\nTable of \nContents\nOur business strategies for our homebuilding and mortgage finance businesses may not increase our value.\nOur strategies for our core homebuilding and mortgage finance businesses, and any related initiatives or actions, may not be successful. Principal among our current strategies is continuing to reduce the inventory of land we own (i.e., to become a land lighter company), and to control a greater portion of the land we expect to use through options or other contractual arrangements, including through the proposed Millrose Spin-Off. We cannot provide assurance that this strategy, or other strategies we will follow, will increase our value.\n \nIt is possible that the land lighter or other strategies will reduce, rather than increase, the value and profitability of our core businesses.\nThe market for new homes is cyclical, and a continuing downturn in the homebuilding market could adversely affect our operations.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, product affordability, availability of financing, inflation, and interest rate levels. As a result, over the years, demand for new homes has been cyclical, with multi-year periods of high demand followed by multi-year periods of low demand. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, a number of our markets experienced significant softening that required us to make substantial price reductions in order to maintain a steady sales pace. It is possible that a continued market weakness could result in a further decline in demand for new homes with resulting price reductions which could require write downs in the carrying value of our land inventory and write offs of costs of land purchase options we decide not to exercise.\nInflation could adversely affect our profitability.\nWeaker demand has precluded us from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which has reduced our profit margins. In addition, in an inflationary environment, our cost of capital, labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline, which can have an adverse impact on our business or financial results. Inflation may also accompany higher interest rates, which could adversely impact potential buyers’ ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby decreasing demand for our homes. We are taking steps that we hope will enable us to maintain acceptable operating margins in fiscal 2025. However, it is possible that those steps will not be successful, and that a combination of inflation and reduced demand for new homes driven by an increase in mortgage interest rates will continue to adversely affect our profitability.\nFurther increase in mortgage interest rates could reduce potential buyers’ ability or desire to obtain financing with which to buy homes. \nHousing has been considerably impacted by the more than doubling of mortgage interest rates in 2022 and 2023, and small decreases in 2024. When interest rates increase, the cost of owning a new home increases, which usually reduces the number of potential buyers who can afford, or are willing, to purchase homes we build.\nA decline in prices of new homes could require us to write down the carrying value of land we own and to write off option costs.\nWe are constantly purchasing land, or acquiring options to purchase land, for use in our homebuilding operations. The value of land suitable for residential development fluctuates depending on local and national market conditions and other factors that affect demand for new homes. When demand for homes fell during the 2007-2010 recession, we were required to take significant write-downs of the carrying value of our land inventory and we elected not to exercise many options to purchase land, which required us to forfeit deposits and write-off pre-acquisition costs. Although we have reduced our exposure to costs of that type, a certain amount of exposure is inherent in our homebuilding business. If market conditions were to deteriorate significantly in the future, we could again be required to make significant write-downs of the carrying value of our land inventory and write-offs costs relating to decisions not to exercise land purchase options.\nCurrent and threatened international conflicts could affect demand for the homes we build.\nThere currently are ongoing conflicts involving Ukraine and Israel. While we do not acquire essential components of the homes we build from either of those countries and while as of November 30, 2024, neither of these conflicts has had a material direct impact on our consolidated financial performance, those and other possible conflicts have already led and could lead to further market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. In addition, the closure of or limitation on the use of significant shipping routes as a result of these and related conflicts may result in interruptions to the supply of certain key raw materials that are used in products which we incorporate in the homes we build, increasing their cost. International conflicts also may lead potential homebuyers to decide not to invest in new homes at this time, which could have a material impact on our business operations and financial performance. \n12\nTable of \nContents\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by public health issues, and resulting governmental actions\nThe United States has experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk. The extent to which public health issues impact our results will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted. If a contagious disease causes significant negative impacts to economic conditions or consumer confidence, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nOperational Risks\nHomebuilding, mortgage lending and home rentals are very competitive industries, and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nHomebuilding\n. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable land, financing, raw materials, skilled management and labor resources. We compete in each of our markets with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders. We also compete with sellers of existing homes, including foreclosed homes, and with rental housing. These competitive conditions can reduce the number of homes we deliver, negatively impact our selling prices, reduce our profit margins, and cause impairments in the value of our inventory or other assets. Competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land, raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or other terms.\nFinancial Services\n. Our Financial Services residential and commercial lending businesses compete with other residential and commercial mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local banks and other financial institutions. Mortgage lenders who have greater access to low-cost funds, superior technologies or different lending criteria than we do may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers than we can.\nMultifamily\n. Our multifamily rental business competes with other developers and operators of multifamily apartment communities at locations across the U.S. where we have investments in multifamily rental properties. We also compete in securing partners, equity capital and debt financing, and we compete for tenants with the large supply of already existing or newly built rental apartments, as well as with sellers and renters of single-family homes. These competitive conditions could negatively impact the ability of the funds and ventures we manage to find renters for the apartments they are building or the prices for which those apartments can be rented.\nSingle-Family Home Rentals\n. In each region where our funds offer single-family homes for rent, there will be competition for residents with other owners of residential real estate (whether for-rent or for-sale). In addition, in seeking investors to acquire interests in funds we form, we will be competing with a wide variety of investment opportunities, related both to real estate and to a variety of other investment products. Also, in seeking to acquire single-family homes that our funds can hold as rental properties, our funds will be competing with other persons who plan to hold them as rental properties as well as persons who might want to purchase those homes to live in them.\nWe may be subject to costs of warranty and liability claims in excess of the insurance coverage we can purchase.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject in the ordinary course of our business to warranty and construction defect claims. We are also subject to claims for injuries that occur in the course of construction activities. We record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build. We have, and many of our subcontractors have, general liability, property, workers' compensation and other business insurance. These insurance policies are intended to protect us against risk of loss from claims, subject to self-insured retentions, deductibles and coverage limits. However, it is possible that this insurance will not be adequate to address all warranty, construction defect and liability claims to which we are subject. \nAdditionally, the cost of insurance has increased significantly in recent years. Also, the coverage offered and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and policies that can be obtained often include exclusions based upon past losses those insurers suffered as a result of use of defective materials in homes we and many other homebuilders built. As a result, an increasing number of our subcontractors are unable to obtain insurance, and we have in many cases had to waive our customary insurance requirements, which increases our and our insurers’ exposure to claims and increases the possibility that our insurance will not be adequate to protect us against all the costs we incur. This increase in cost and limitation in coverage has also increased our self-insured retentions and decreased our total coverage. It is possible in the future that insurance would not be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even when insurance is available, the high cost of insurance has recently led us to self-insure against some risks .\nExcessive health and safety incidents relating to our operations could be costly to us.\nLand development and construction\n \nare inherently dangerous. While safety is a priority on our land development and construction sites, we cannot always control the way work is performed by subcontractors, including whether they comply with laws and regulations designed to maximize the safety of construction workers. Failures in health and safety performance on our \n13\nTable of \nContents\nworksites may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements and in our subcontractors having difficulty attracting the workers they need as well as in a negative impact to our reputation.\nProducts supplied to us and work done by subcontractors can expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes, and in many cases, to select and obtain building materials. Despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures, in some cases, subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials. Defective products widely used by the homebuilding industry can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes. The cost of complying with our warranty obligations may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repairs from subcontractors, materials suppliers and insurers.\nWe also can suffer damage to our reputation, and may be exposed to possible liability, if subcontractors fail to comply with applicable laws, including laws involving things that are not within our control. When we learn about possibly improper practices by subcontractors, we try to cause the subcontractors to discontinue them. However, we may not always be able to do that, and even when we can, it may not avoid claims against us relating to work the subcontractors already performed.\nA reduced number of home sales would extend the time it takes us to recover land purchase and property development costs.\nWe incur many costs even before we begin to build homes in a community. Depending on the stage of development a land parcel is in when we acquire it (or when it is acquired by Millrose or another land banking entity), these may include costs of preparing land, finishing and entitling lots, installing roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities, and taxes and other costs related to ownership of the land on which we plan to build homes. If the rate at which we sell and deliver homes slows, or if we delay the opening of new home communities, we may incur increased pre-construction costs and it may take longer for us to recover those costs.\nIncreased interest rates could increase our cost of building homes.\nOur business requires us to finance much of the cost of developing our residential communities. One of the ways we do this is with bank borrowings. At November 30, 2024, we had a $2.9 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks (the \"Credit Facility\"), which had an accordion feature that could increase it to $3.5 billion. We also had warehouse borrowing facilities totaling $3.4 billion to support our residential and commercial mortgage lending activities. The interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is at rates based on prevailing short-term rates from time to time. In 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve steadily raised benchmark interest rates and the Federal Reserve did not begin reducing benchmark interest rates until well into 2024. At November 30, 2024, we had no borrowings under our Credit Facility. However, if in the future we have a need for significant borrowings under our Credit Facility and interest rates continue be high, that would increase the cost of the homes we build, which either would make those homes more expensive for homebuyers, which is likely to reduce demand, or would lower our operating margins, or both.\nIncreases in the rate of cancellations of home sale agreements could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur backlog reflects agreements of sale with our homebuyers for homes that have not yet been delivered. We usually have received a deposit from our homebuyer for each home reflected in our backlog, and generally we have the right to retain the deposit if the homebuyer does not complete the purchase. In some cases, however, a homebuyer may cancel the agreement of sale and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit for reasons such as state and local laws, the homebuyer’s inability to obtain mortgage financing, the homebuyer's inability to sell their current home or our inability to complete and deliver the home within the specified time. With the increase in interest rates, we have experienced an increase in cancellation rates. If there is a weakening of the housing market, or if mortgage financing becomes less available or more expensive than it currently is or is expected to be more homebuyers may cancel their agreements of sale with us, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur success to a substantial extent depends on our ability to acquire land that is suitable for residential homebuilding and meets our land investment criteria.\nThere is strong competition among homebuilders for land that is suitable for residential development. The future availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we could build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations. \nWe could be hurt if land banks are not able to raise investor funds needed to enable them to supplement land acquisitions by Millrose.\nWe formed and intend to spin off Millrose to make it a recycling source of land acquisition funding. However, Millrose will not have the capacity to provide all the land acquisition funding we require, and Millrose’s policies will limit its acquisitions to land we expect to use within five years. We will look to traditional land banks to acquire at least some of the \n14\nTable of \nContents\nland that Millrose will not or cannot acquire. Most land banks are funds that use financial investor capital to finance land acquisitions. If returns to investors in land banks are not sufficient to attract investor funds and land banks are not able to identify alternative sources of funding, we would no longer have access to land banks. This could significantly impair our ability to carry out our strategy of reducing our inventory of owned land.\nWe could be hurt by refusals of owners of land to honor options or contracts to sell land to us.\nWe have made a strategic decision to increase the portion of our potential land inventory that we control through options or contracts and reduce the portion we own. This substantially reduces our investment in land. However, if landowners who are parties to the options or contracts, possibly including land banks, were to refuse to honor them, we could lose access to land at the time we want to use it in our homebuilding activities.\nThe loss of the services of members of our senior management or a significant number of our operating employees could negatively affect our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of our senior management, many of whom have been with us for 20 or more years. If we were to lose members of our senior management, we might not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our operations could be negatively affected. Also, the loss of a significant number of key operating employees and our inability to hire qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNatural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries and increase costs of new homes in affected areas, which could harm our sales and results of operations.\n Many of our homebuilding operations are conducted in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts, floods, wildfires and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories and lead to shortages of labor and materials in areas affected by the disasters, and can negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas. Our insurance may not cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events and our results of operations could be adversely affected by these events. Additionally, natural disasters and severe weather conditions may increase the cost of homeowner's insurance or create difficulties in obtaining homeowners’ insurance at all, which could reduce the number of potential buyers who can afford, or are willing, to purchase homes we build in affected areas. For example, the incidence of large wildfires in California has substantially increased in recent years and the risk of future wildfires is expected to increase. The housing markets in areas affected by California’s recent wildfires have been adversely affected by increased insurance costs and difficulties in obtaining homeowners’ insurance, which we expect to be exacerbated by the recent wildfires in Los Angeles.\nIf our homebuyers are not able to obtain suitable financing, that would reduce demand for our homes and our home sales revenues.\nMost purchasers of our homes obtain mortgage loans to finance a substantial portion of the purchase price of the homes they purchase. While the majority of our homebuyers obtain their mortgage financing from our Financial Services segment, others obtain mortgage financing from banks and other independent lenders. Disruptions in the mortgage markets or increased government regulation could adversely affect the ability of potential homebuyers to obtain financing for home purchases, making it difficult for them to purchase our homes. Among other things, changes made by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and FHA/VA in recent years to sponsored mortgage programs, as well as changes made in recent years by private mortgage insurance companies, have reduced the ability of a number of potential homebuyers to qualify for mortgages. Principal among these are higher income requirements, larger required down payments, increased reserves and higher required credit scores. In addition, there has been uncertainty regarding the future of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, including proposals that they reduce or terminate their role as the principal sources of liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans. It is not clear how, if Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae were to curtail their secondary market mortgage loan purchases, the liquidity they provide would be replaced. There is a substantial possibility that substituting an alternate source of liquidity would increase mortgage interest rates, which would increase the buyers' effective costs of paying for the homes we sell, and therefore could reduce demand for our homes and adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could increase the cost of owning a home.\nCurrently, there are significant income tax benefits from owning a home, including deductibility of all or some interest on mortgage loans incurred to finance home purchases and the deductibility of property taxes, subject to certain limits. If federal or state tax laws are changed to eliminate or reduce any of these income tax benefits or if personal income or property tax rates were to increase, \nthe after-tax cost of homeownership could measurably increase and diminish consumer interest in buying a home, \nwith a resulting adverse effect on our revenues.\n15\nTable of \nContents\nOur Financial Services segment can be adversely affected by reduced demand for our homes.\n100% of the residential mortgage loans made by our Financial Services segment in 2024 were made to buyers of homes we built. Therefore, a decrease in the demand for our homes or an increase in the mortgage financing obtained by homebuyers from lenders other than our Financial Services segment would adversely affect the revenues of this aspect of our business.\nIf our ability to sell residential mortgages into the secondary market is impaired, that could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes unless we are willing to become a long-term investor in loans we originate.\nSubstantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis. If we became unable to sell residential mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, we would have to either curtail our origination of residential mortgage loans, which among other things, could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes, or commit our own funds to long-term investments in mortgage loans, which, in addition to requiring us to deploy substantial amounts of our own funds, could delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations.\nWe may be liable for certain limited representations and warranties we make in connection with the sale of loans.\nWhile substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis, we remain responsible for certain industry standard limited representations and warranties we make in connection with such sales. Mortgage investors sometimes seek to have us buy back mortgage loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgage loans that we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations and warranties. In addition, when LMF Commercial sells loans to securitization trusts or other purchasers, it gives limited industry standard representations and warranties about the loans, which, if incorrect, may require it to repurchase the loans, replace them with substitute loans or indemnify persons for losses or expenses incurred as a result of breaches of representations and warranties. If we have significant liabilities with respect to such claims, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, and possibly our financial condition.\nFinancing Risks\nFailure to comply with the covenants and conditions imposed by our lenders could restrict future borrowing or cause our debt to become immediately due and payable.\nThe agreement governing our Credit Facility (the \"Credit Agreement\") makes it a default if we fail to pay principal or interest when it is due (subject, in some instances, to grace periods) or to comply with various covenants, including covenants regarding financial ratios. In addition, our Financial Services residential mortgage companies and our LMF Commercial mortgage lending group have warehouse facilities to finance their mortgage lending. If we default under the Credit Agreement or our warehouse facilities, the lenders will have the right to terminate their commitments to lend and to require immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings. This could reduce our available funds at a time when we are having difficulty generating all the funds we need from our operations, in the capital markets or otherwise, and restrict our ability to obtain financing in the future. In addition, if we default under the Credit Agreement or our warehouse facilities, it could cause the amounts outstanding under our senior notes to become immediately due and payable, which would seriously adversely impact our consolidated financial condition.\nWe have a substantial level of indebtedness, which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.\nAs of November 30, 2024, we had outstanding senior notes which we had sold into the capital markets over a number of years totaling $2.0 billion. The indentures governing our senior notes do not restrict our incurrence of future secured or unsecured debt, and the agreement governing our Credit Facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt. We reduced our outstanding senior notes during fiscal 2024 by $554.0 million, but we still have a significant amount outstanding. Sales of senior debt into the capital markets was historically a significant source of funding for our operations and acquisitions.\n \nOur level of indebtedness exposes us to a number of risks, including:\n•\nWe may be more vulnerable to volatility within the capital market, general adverse economic and homebuilding industry conditions;\n•\nWe may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing indebtedness as a result of the increase in market interest rates, thereby reducing our earnings and cash flows;\n•\nWe may find it difficult, or may be unable, to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best long-term interests;\n•\nWe may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the cash flow available to fund operations and investments and reducing the amount we can return to our stockholders;\n16\nTable of \nContents\n•\nWe may have reduced flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses or the industries in which they are conducted;\n•\nWe may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry, if any, that are less leveraged; and\n•\nWe may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet debt payment obligations.\nOur access to capital and our ability to obtain additional financing could be affected if there was a downgrade of our credit ratings.\nOur corporate credit rating and ratings of our senior notes affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital, especially debt, and the costs of that new capital. Historically, a substantial portion of our access to capital has been through the issuance of senior notes, of which we have approximately $2.0 billion outstanding, net of debt issuance costs, as of November 30, 2024. Among other things, we have often relied on proceeds of debt issuances to pay the principal of existing senior notes when they mature. Negative changes in the ratings of our senior notes could make it difficult for us to sell senior notes in the future and could result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates with regard to new senior notes we issue.\nDuring 2025, we will have to replace or renew a total of $3.4 billion of warehouse lines used by Financial Services, including LMF Commercial, as they mature. We expect these facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. If we are unable to renew or replace these facilities on favorable terms or at all when they mature, that could seriously impede the activities of our Financial Services segment, which would have an impact on our financial results.\nAn inability to obtain performance bonds or post letters of credit could adversely affect our operations.\nWe often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance of obligations under construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. At November 30, 2024, we had outstanding surety bonds of $5.1 billion including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities to which they relate are completed. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating, financial condition, past performance and similar factors, the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers. Our ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by unwillingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities. If we were unable to obtain surety bonds when required, our operations could be adversely affected.\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures with independent third parties and we can be adversely impacted by our joint venture partners' failures to fulfill their obligations or decisions to act contrary to our wishes.\nIn our Homebuilding and Multifamily segments, we participate in joint ventures in order to help us acquire attractive land positions, to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base. In certain circumstances, joint venture participants, including us, are required to provide guarantees of obligations relating to the joint ventures, such as completion and environmental guarantees. If a joint venture partner does not perform its obligations, we may be required to bear more than our proportional share of the cost of fulfilling the joint venture’s obligations. For example, in connection with our Multifamily business, and its joint ventures, we and the other venture participants have guaranteed obligations to complete construction of multifamily residential buildings at agreed-upon costs, which could make us and the other venture participants responsible for cost over-runs. Although all the participants in a venture are normally responsible for sharing the costs of fulfilling obligations of that type, if some of the venture participants are unable or unwilling to meet their share of the obligations, we may be held responsible for some or all of the defaulted payments. In addition, because we do not have a controlling interest in most of the joint ventures in which we participate, we may not be able to cause joint ventures to sell assets, return invested capital or take other actions when such actions might be in our best interest.\nSeveral of the joint ventures in which we participate will in the relatively near future be required to repay, refinance, renegotiate or extend their borrowings. If any of those joint ventures are unable to do this, we could be required to provide at least a portion of the funds the joint ventures need to be able to repay the borrowings and to finance the activities for which they were incurred, which could adversely impact our financial position.\nRegulatory Risks\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may substantially increase the costs or limit supplies of building materials and products used in our homes.\nDuring the past several years, the U.S. government has imposed new, or increased existing, tariffs on an array of imported materials and products that are used in the homes we build, including lumber, steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines, which increases the costs of those items. The tariffs that have been imposed or increased have impacted our \n17\nTable of \nContents\nconstruction costs and caused disruptions in our supply chains. In addition, President Trump has expressed a desire to impose substantial new or increased tariffs. Any widespread imposition of new or increased tariffs could increase the cost of, and reduce the demand for, homes we build and any cost increases will either require us to increase prices or negatively impact our profit margins. New or increased tariffs could also negatively affect U.S. national or regional economies, which could affect the demand for the homes we build.\nWe may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes.\nWe are subject with regard to almost all of our activities to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Laws and regulations, and policies under or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, change frequently. Our businesses could be adversely affected by changes in laws, regulations, policies or interpretations or by our inability to comply with them without making significant changes in our businesses.\nGovernmental regulations regarding land use and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect land development, homebuilding and apartment development processes, including laws and regulations related to zoning, permitted land uses, levels of density, building design, elevation of properties, water and waste disposal and use of open spaces. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions that must be met prior to development or construction being approved, if they are approved at all. We are also subject to determinations by governmental authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities, roads and other local services with regard to particular residential communities. New housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public improvements. In addition, in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives. Any of these can limit, delay, or increase the costs of land development or home construction. Government restrictions, standards, or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts are likely to result in restrictions on land development in certain areas and may increase energy, transportation, or raw material costs, which could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations. This is a particular concern in the western United States, where some of the most extensive and stringent environmental laws and residential building construction standards in the country have been enacted, and where we have substantial homebuilding and multifamily operations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of the environment. In some of the markets where we operate, we are required by law to pay environmental impact fees, use energy-saving construction materials and give commitments to municipalities to provide infrastructure such as roads and sewage systems. We generally are required to obtain permits, entitlements and approvals from local authorities to commence and carry out residential development or home construction. These permits, entitlements and approvals sometimes are opposed or challenged by local governments, environmental advocacy groups, neighboring property owners or other possibly interested parties, adding delays, costs and risks of non-approval to the process. Violations of environmental laws and regulations can result in injunctions, civil penalties, remediation expenses, and other costs. In addition, some environmental laws impose strict liability, which means that we may be held liable for unlawful environmental conditions on property we own which we did not create.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations related to workers' health and safety, and there are efforts to subject homebuilders like us to other labor related laws or rules, some of which may make us responsible for things done by our subcontractors over which we have little or no control. \nIn addition, our residential mortgage subsidiary is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and loan servicing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers’ costs of financing, and our cost of doing business, as well as restricting our homebuyers’ access to some types of loans.\nOur obligation to comply with the laws and regulations under which we operate, and our need to ensure that our associates, subcontractors and other agents comply with these laws and regulations, could result in delays in construction and land development, cause us to incur substantial costs and prohibit or restrict land development and homebuilding activity in certain areas in which we operate. Budget reductions by state and local governmental agencies may increase the time it takes to obtain required approvals and therefore may aggravate the delays we encounter. In 2020 and 2021, shutdowns of government offices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic often delayed the time it took to obtain required approvals. Government agencies also routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our businesses that can be significant.\nWe can be injured by improper acts of persons over whom we do not have control.\nAlthough we expect all of our associates, officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices \n18\nTable of \nContents\nthat do not comply with applicable laws, regulations or governmental guidelines. When we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations, including practices relating to homes, buildings or multifamily rental properties we build or finance, we move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible and we have taken disciplinary action with regard to associates of ours who were aware of non-complying practices and did not take steps to address them, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations, we can in certain cases be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation can be injured, due to the practices having taken place.\nWe could be held responsible for obligations of, and labor law violations by, our subcontractors and other contract parties.\nThe homes we sell are built by employees of subcontractors and other contract parties. We do not have the ability to control what these contract parties pay their employees or the work rules they impose on their employees. However, various governmental agencies have sought, and in the future may seek, to hold contract parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws, workers’ compensation and other work-related laws by firms whose employees are performing contracted for services. While the future of joint employer liability remains uncertain, if we were deemed to be a joint employer of our subcontractors’ employees, we could become responsible for collective bargaining obligations of, and labor law violations by, our subcontractors. Governmental rulings that make us responsible for labor practices by our subcontractors could create substantial exposures for us in situations that are not within our control.\nRisk Related to Planned Spin-Off\nThe Millrose Spin-Off of much of our land assets may not occur on the timeline we expect or at all and we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits from this transaction even if completed.\nWe previously announced that we expect to spin off a significant portion of our land assets from our balance sheet through the spin-off of Millrose. Millrose has filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective on January 17, 2025, and our Board declared a special stock dividend to effect the Millrose Spin-Off to Lennar stockholders of record as of January 21, 2025, with a distribution date of February 7, 2025. However, the completion of the Millrose Spin-Off remains subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the execution of certain agreements relating to the Millrose Spin-Off and other customary conditions, some of which will not occur until shortly prior to the distribution date. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, as well as other factors outside of our control, including general economic and market conditions, could delay the completion of the Millrose Spin-Off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in the completion of the Millrose Spin-Off or any change to the anticipated terms of the transaction could reduce the expected benefits of the transaction or delay the time at which such benefits are realized. There can also be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized if the Millrose Spin-Off is completed, or that the costs will not exceed the anticipated benefits. \nIn addition, whether or not the Millrose Spin-Off is ultimately completed, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs associated with the planned transaction and the pendency of the planned transaction has imposed and may continue to impose challenges on us, including the diversion of management and employee time on matters relating to the proposed transaction while continuing to operate in the ordinary course of business.  \nIf the planned Millrose Spin-Off is completed, Millrose may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we expect to enter into in connection with the Millrose Spin-Off and our homebuilding operations could be seriously disrupted if Millrose refused to honor purchase options it is expected to grant us. \nIf completed, in connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, we expect to enter into a number of agreements with Millrose, pursuant to which Millrose will provide Lennar with land acquisition and horizontal development financing solutions. We would rely on Millrose to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Millrose were unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties and/or losses.\nIn particular, if the planned Millrose Spin-Off is completed, we expect to transfer a significant portion of our inventory of undeveloped and partially developed land, as well as some finished homesites, to Millrose, which would be an independent, externally managed, publicly traded company. In addition, if the planned Millrose Spin-Off is completed, we expect that in the future we will do a number of our land acquisitions through arrangements under which Millrose will acquire land we specify and grant us options to purchase the land when it is developed into finished homesites. That land is and would be essential to our homebuilding operations, and we expect to have options that would give us access to that land when it is developed into finished homesites. We also expect that our options and other agreements with Millrose would contain provisions requiring Millrose to deliver homesites to us even if it is disputing our right to exercise options. However, if Millrose were to refuse to honor option exercises despite requirements that it honor them, that could delay or prevent us from building and delivering homes, while we try to get courts to require Millrose to deliver homesites to us. Even if we were to succeed in any legal proceedings against Millrose, there is no guarantee that a court would compel Millrose to deliver the homesites to us. Monetary damages may not be sufficient for us to fully recoup our losses, particularly if we have contracts with homebuyers with respect \n19\nTable of \nContents\nto the disputed homesites, and we would not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to those contracts. Any loss of access to our homesites could injure both our revenues and our reputation as a reliable homebuilder.\nIf the planned Millrose Spin-Off is completed, we may lose access to the land or homesites we would contribute to Millrose or that Millrose acquires in the future pursuant to our specifications in the event of lender foreclosures or bankruptcy proceedings. \nIf the planned Millrose Spin-Off is completed, Millrose will be an independent, publicly traded company, and in the future may enter into various “secured financing arrangements,” which may include but are not limited to secured or collateralized loans, or any other transactions where assets may be pledged or used as collateral to secure the financing instrument. In connection with these arrangements, Millrose would have the right to pledge or use as collateral the inventory of land assets we would transfer to them in connection with the Millrose Spin-Off and the land assets that Millrose acquires in the future pursuant to our specifications. If Millrose were to default under these arrangements, the lenders of these arrangements may foreclose on these assets. Similarly, if Millrose were become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, Millrose may forfeit its assets, including these assets, to any and all creditors or creditors may reject our purchase options in bankruptcy. If we were unable to successful protect our purchase options, buy the applicable assets directly from the lenders or otherwise retain access to these assets, that could delay or prevent us from building and delivering homes and cause us significant harm.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe have a stockholder who can exercise significant influence over matters that are brought to a vote of our stockholders.\nStuart Miller, our Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, through family and personal holdings of Class B, and to a lesser extent Class A, common stock, has the power to cast approximately 40% of the votes that can be cast by the holders of all our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock combined. This gives Mr. Miller substantial influence regarding the election of our directors and the approval of most other matters that are presented to our stockholders. Mr. Miller's voting power might discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, even if we needed the investment to meet our obligations or to operate our business. Also, because of his voting power, Mr. Miller may be able to cause our stockholders to approve actions that are contrary to many of our other stockholders' desires.\nOur Class B common stock is less liquid than and has traded at a price substantially lower than that of our Class A common stock.\nThe only significant difference between our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock is that the Class B common stock entitles the holders to ten votes per share, while the Class A common stock entitles holders to only one vote per share. However, for many years, the trading price of the Class B common stock on the NYSE has been substantially lower than the NYSE trading price of our Class A common stock. We believe this is because only a relatively small number of shares of Class B common stock are available for trading, which reduces the liquidity of the market for our Class B common stock to a point where many large investors are reluctant to invest in it. The limited liquidity could make it difficult for a holder of even a relatively small number of shares of our Class B common stock to dispose of the stock without materially reducing the trading price of the Class B common stock.\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others, developments in our industry, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions and policies in the United States and around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance\n.\nOther Risks\nWe have substantial investments in real estate related funds and businesses in which we are a minority investor.\nWe have investments in funds and other investment vehicles managed by Rialto Capital Management, a company we sold in November 2018, investments in a number of companies that are applying technology to various aspects of building and marketing homes and real estate related aspects of the financial services industry, and investments in Five Point Holdings, LLC, a publicly traded company that has ownership interests in, and is managing the development of, three large multi-use master planned communities in California. As a minority investor, we have little or no influence over decisions made with regard to \n20\nTable of \nContents\nthese funds and businesses. However, we could suffer significant losses of our investments as a result of decisions that are made by the funds and businesses.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if legal claims against us are not resolved in our favor.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to legal claims by homebuyers, borrowers against whom we have instituted foreclosure proceedings, persons with whom we have land purchase contracts and a variety of other claimants. We establish reserves against legal claims and we believe that, in general, the outcome of legal claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. However, if the amounts we are required to pay as a result of claims against us substantially exceed the sums anticipated by our reserves, the need to pay those amounts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods when we are required to make or accrue the payments.\nWe could be subject to unexpected tax liabilities.\nWe have provisions and reserves for taxes that we believe are sufficient to reflect our future tax obligations. However, it is possible that a taxing authority will successfully assert that we owe taxes that we do not believe that we owe and for which we do not have a provision or reserves.\n \nIf the additional taxes are material, they could adversely affect our income tax provision and, consequently, our operating results and financial condition, in the period in which we determine we need an additional provision or reserves.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology (\"IT\") systems, including Internet sites, data hosting facilities and other hardware and software platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting our businesses. These IT systems, like those used by most companies, may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including, but not limited to, those caused by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, these IT systems, like those of most companies, are subject to the possibility of computer viruses or other malicious codes, and to security breaches, cyber incidents, ransomware attacks or phishing-attacks. Cyber intrusion efforts are becoming increasingly frequent and sophisticated, including as a result of the use of artificial intelligence, and it is possible that any controls we or third parties have installed could at some time be breached in a material respect. While, to date, we have not had a cybersecurity disruption, failure, breach or attack that had a material impact on our business or results of operations, if we were to be subject to a material successful cyber-incident, that could result in remediation or service restoration costs, increased cyber protection costs, lost revenues or loss of customers, litigation or regulatory actions by governmental authorities, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage and damage to our competitiveness, our stock price and our long-term stockholder value. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches (including through the provision of insurance).\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us\n.\nIn connection with our business we and the third parties we work with collect and retain personally identifiable information (e.g., information regarding our customers, suppliers and employees), and our customers, suppliers and employees have an expectation that we will adequately protect that information. The U.S. regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we [or third parties] maintain, or of our data, by cyber-criminals or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the future as legal requirements continue to increase, including through the provision of insurance\nInternational activities subject us to risks inherent in international operations.\nWe historically have sold significant numbers of homes in communities in the United States to people who are not residents of the United States, and some large investors in our multifamily development and single-family rental funds and ventures are located outside the United States. Dealings with people or institutions located outside the United States create risks related to currencies and to political affairs in various countries. In some instances, the U.S government may review the possible effects of investments by non-U.S. entities on U.S. national security. We must also be careful to comply with U.S. anti-corruption laws. Also, we have to be aware of tax issues involved in doing business outside the United States or with people who are not residents of the United States, both under U.S. tax laws and under the tax laws of the countries in which we do business or in which the non-residents reside.\nWe experience variability in our operating results on a quarterly basis.\nOur homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second fiscal quarter and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, a variety of factors can change seasonal patterns. Our quarterly results of operations may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, \n21\nTable of \nContents\nincluding, among others, seasonal homebuying patterns, the timing of home closings and land sales and weather-related problems.\nWe could suffer significant losses if there are reductions in the market value of our investments in publicly traded companies.\nWe have made investments in companies that are engaged in applying technology to improve the homebuilding industry and real estate related aspects of the financial services industry. Our investments in Blend, Hippo, Opendoor, SmartRent, Sonder, and Sunnova, all of which have publicly traded shares of common stock are carried on our books at their fair values, which will change depending on the value of the Company’s shareholdings on the last day of each quarter. As a result, our net earnings could be significantly affected by mark-to-market gains or losses on our investments.\nChanges in global or regional environmental conditions and governmental actions in response to such changes may adversely affect us by increasing the costs of or restricting our planned or future growth activities.\nThere is growing concern from many members of the scientific community and the general public that an increase in global average temperatures due to emissions of greenhouse gases and other human activities have caused, or will cause, significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Government mandates, standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or projected climate change impacts have resulted, and are likely to continue to result, in restrictions on land development in certain areas and increased energy, transportation and raw material costs. We have tried to reduce the effect of the homes we build on the climate by installing solar power systems and energy saving devices in many of those homes. Nonetheless, governmental requirements directed at reducing effects on climate could cause us to incur expenses that we cannot recover or that will require us to increase the price of homes we sell to the point that it affects demand for those homes.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe risk factors described above are those that we think may be material with regard to an investment in us that are not applicable generally to all business enterprises. However, we are subject to the many risks that affect all or most business enterprises in the United States or internationally, and our business or financial condition could be materially affected by those risks.\nItem 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following individuals are our executive officers as of January 23, 2025:\nName\nPosition\nAge\nStuart Miller\nExecutive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer\n67\nJonathan M.

These systems, like those used by most companies, may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including, but not limited to, those caused by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, these IT systems, like those used by most companies, are subject to the possibility of computer viruses or other malicious codes, and to security breaches, cyber incidents, ransomware attack or phishing-attacks. \nCybersecurity is an integral part of risk management at our Company, and we maintain a comprehensive process for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, which is part of our overall risk management system and processes.\nWe have installed and continually upgrade an array of protections against cyber-intrusions. Our cybersecurity risk management processes are based upon the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, as well as various other regulatory requirements and industry-specific standards. We implement risk-based controls to protect our information, the information of our customers, suppliers, and other third parties, our information systems, our business operations, and our products and related services. These controls include multifactor authentication on all critical systems, firewalls, encryption, anti-virus protections, intrusion detection and prevention systems and identity management systems. We provide mandatory cybersecurity awareness training of threats to associates at least annually and routinely deploy simulated phishing tests to increase security awareness.\n \nOur IT team regularly tests our controls through penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, internal compliance assessments, threat-hunting operations and attack simulation.\nAdditionally, in connection with our cybersecurity risk management processes, from time to time, \nwe engage independent third parties to assess our cybersecurity program and to assist us with defining our cybersecurity strategy, uplifting our processes and aligning our objectives.\n Outside counsel has also advised the Board about legal obligations in managing cybersecurity issues and risks.\nWe maintain a cybersecurity incident response plan, which provides a framework for handling cybersecurity incidents based on, among other factors, the potential severity of the incident and facilitates cross-functional coordination across the Company. We also conduct “tabletop” exercises, including exercises facilitated by third parties, during which we simulate cybersecurity incidents to ensure that we are prepared to respond to such an incident and to highlight any areas for potential improvement in our cybersecurity incident response plan. These exercises are conducted at both the technical level and senior management level and have included participation by members of our Board.\nOur cybersecurity risk management processes extend to the oversight and identification of threats associated with our use of third-party service providers, including through due diligence of such providers’ cybersecurity practices, contractual obligations to operate their IT systems in accordance with certain cybersecurity standards and ongoing monitoring.\nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks and any future material incidents\n. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on risks from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernance\nManagement \nOur \nChief Technology Officer (“CTO”)\n is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. We have also established a cross-functional Cyber Steering Committee, which includes our CTO, Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), General Counsel, certain business leaders on a rotating basis and representatives of human resources and communications. The CISO, supported by inputs from the CTO team leads, delivers quarterly updates to the Committee on key risks and overall security program posture, as well as monthly strategic updates to the CTO on high visibility and key action items. \nOur CTO regularly reports to our Board and the Audit Committee.\nOur CTO has served in this role since 2023 and has over 25 years of experience in the technology industry. Prior to his current role, he served as the CTO of Tyson Foods and before arriving at Tyson, he was the Chief Information Officer at Hewlett Packard, and then CIO at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nBoard of Directors\nOur Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks and receives a cybersecurity report from \n23\nTable of \nContents\nour CTO at least quarterly, and more often as needed, including in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident. The report includes information regarding the nature of threats, defense and detection capabilities, incident response plans and associate training activities. Our Board retains responsibility for the oversight of our overall risk management systems and processes and is briefed our CTO on cybersecurity risks on a quarterly basis.\nItem 2.    Properties.\nWe maintain our corporate headquarters in an office building in Miami, Florida. In December 2023, we purchased this office building, in which we had previously leased office space for our corporate headquarters. This building contains approximately 213,200 square feet of office space, of which we lease approximately 53,000 square feet of unused office space to other tenants. Our homebuilding, financial services and multifamily offices are located in the markets where we conduct business, primarily in leased spaces. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operation.\nBecause of the nature of our homebuilding operations, we hold significant amounts of property as inventory in connection with our homebuilding business. We discuss these properties in the discussion of our homebuilding operations in Items 1 and 7 of this Report.\nItem 3.    Legal Proceedings.\nWe are party to various claims and lawsuits relating to homes we sold which arise in the ordinary course of business, but we do not consider the volume of our claims and lawsuits unusual given the number of homes we deliver and the fact that the lawsuits often relate to homes delivered several years before the lawsuits are commenced. Although the specific allegations in the lawsuits differ, they most commonly involve claims that we failed to construct homes in particular communities in accordance with plans and specifications or applicable construction codes and seek reimbursement for sums allegedly needed to remedy the alleged deficiencies, assert contract issues or relate to personal injuries. Lawsuits of these types are common within the homebuilding industry. We are a plaintiff in a number of cases in which we seek contribution from our subcontractors for home repair costs. The costs incurred by us in construction defect lawsuits may be offset by warranty reserves, our third-party insurers, subcontractor insurers or indemnity contributions from subcontractors. From time to time, we are also a party to lawsuits involving purchases and sales of real property. These lawsuits often include claims regarding representations and warranties made in connection with the transfer of the property and disputes regarding the obligation to purchase or sell the property. From time-to-time, we also receive notices from environmental agencies or other regulators regarding alleged violations of environmental or other laws. We typically settle all of the foregoing matters before they reach litigation for amounts that are not material to us. \nWe do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. However, the financial effect of litigation concerning purchases and sales of property may depend upon the value of the subject property, which may have changed from the time the agreement for purchase or sale was entered into.\nItem 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOur Class A and Class B common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbols \"LEN\" and \"LEN.B,\" respectively.

It also should be read in conjunction with the disclosure under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Form 10-K.\n26\nTable of \nContents\nOutlook \nAs the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 began, we expected affordability to ease with the reduction in interest rates by the Fed, and we priced accordingly, however, mortgage rates climbed approximately 100 basis points instead of falling. We saw sales stall at then-existing price and incentive levels, which required us to increase incentives, provide interest rate buy-downs and adjust prices to stimulate sales and avoid inventory build-up. As a result, we have moderated our expectations for margins and sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as the market adjusts and stabilizes.\nA combination of wavering consumer confidence and elevated acquisition costs dampened customers’ desire and ability to transact. In addition, inflation and interest rates have hindered the ability of the average family to accumulate a down payment or qualify for a mortgage. Higher interest rates have curtailed the normal move up homebuyer as families expand and need more space. However, strong employment often goes hand-in-hand with a strong housing market, and we expect broad-based demand to resume as rates stabilize or even moderate, releasing pent-up demand against short supply.\nTariffs and immigration have recently been added to the list of concerns confronting the homebuilding industry. Our early evaluation suggests that steps we took in the past several years to move supply into the United States will reduce our exposure to the effect of increased tariffs. The likely effects of reduced immigration and possible widespread deportations are more difficult to predict. We feel confident that similar to the supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, we will be able to work with our local trades and national manufacturers to find the most effective solutions due to our Builder of Choice position with consistent high volume and a focus on production efficiencies.\nWe continue to believe in the two core parts of our operating strategy:\nThe first is our focus on matching production with sales pace. Even though our execution in the fourth quarter was challenged by the unexpected change in the direction of interest rates, we were able to adjust incentives and pricing sufficiently to prevent our inventory of finished homes from significantly spiking. We are currently focused on accelerating sales volume in order to correct the sales miss that we had in the fourth quarter. Of course, the catch-up in sales pace comes at a cost, and that cost is impacting our results of operations and placing additional pressure on margin in the first quarter of 2025. We have been able to solve the community count shortfalls of the past and ended the year with 1,447 communities, which was 15% higher than the prior year. Our community count positions us to drive the volume we expect at lower absorption rates as we enter 2025. We expect lower absorption rates to put less stress on our margin over time.\nThe other core part of our operating strategy is our migration from a company with a large inventory of undeveloped and partially developed land to a land-light model where we purchase land on a just-in-time basis. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we had land purchases of $2.1 billion, but 80% of these were finished homesites on which vertical construction can soon begin. This lowers our asset base and our risk profile and will continue to be an intense focus for us.\nThe last major step to complete our land-light strategy will be the spin-off of Millrose Properties, Inc., to which we expect to transfer approximately $5 billion to $6 billion of undeveloped and partially developed land, subject to option agreements to repurchase the land as it is developed into finished homesites, and approximately $1 billion in cash. Because Millrose, unlike investor-financed land banking funds, is designed to be able to reinvest proceeds of homesite purchases in new land acquisition and development arrangements, we expect it to be a long-term, reliable source of land acquisition and development financing for Lennar and other homebuilders. As previously disclosed in Millrose’s registration statement on Form S-11, in connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, we are coordinating a post-spin off transaction with Millrose, which has already been approved by the current Millrose Board of Directors and which we expect will be ratified by the independent Millrose Board of Directors that will be appointed immediately prior to the distribution, in connection with our pending acquisition of Rausch Coleman Homes, a residential homebuilder based in Fayetteville, Arkansas (“Rausch Coleman”). The acquisition of Rausch Coleman will result in our expanding into new and desirable markets in Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri, while growing our existing operations in Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Florida. In this pending acquisition, Lennar will acquire the work-in-process inventory and the operations of Rausch Coleman. We intend to assign the purchase of most of Rausch Coleman’s land assets (the “Rausch Land Assets”) to Millrose. Similar to the other land assets Lennar expects to contribute to Millrose in connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, Lennar expects to enter into options to purchase the developed Rausch Land Assets homesites in accordance with pre-set takedown schedules. We are expecting the acquisition to be completed shortly following the distribution date of the Millrose Spin-Off. We believe that the ongoing relationship with Millrose can facilitate other transactions in an asset-light manner as well.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to drive production to meet the housing shortage we know persists across our markets. We believe volume will continue to help reduce cost pressure and as interest rates normalize, pent-up demand will be released, and margins will recover. We are well prepared with a strong and growing national footprint, an increasing community count and higher volume. Our strong balance sheet and even stronger land banking relationships afford us flexibility and opportunity to execute thoughtful growth for our future. We will focus on our manufacturing model and use our strategic land relationships to achieve higher returns on capital and equity.\nWe will continue to pursue our pure-play business model and reduce exposure to non-core assets. We will be laser focused on our just-in-time homesite deliveries and the resulting asset-light balance sheet. As we complete our asset light \n27\nTable of \nContents\ntransformation, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to return capital to our stockholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\nAgainst the backdrop, we anticipate 17,000 to 17,500 closings in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with gross margins of 19% to 19.25%, and we expect to deliver between 86,000 and 88,000 homes in 2025, including the impact of the Rausch Coleman acquisition.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nOur net earnings attributable to Lennar were $3.9 billion, or $14.31 per diluted and basic share in 2024 and $3.9 billion, or $13.73 per diluted and basic share in 2023. Excluding mark-to-market gains of $25.2 million on technology investments, one-time items of $90.0 million in our Multifamily segment and a $46.5 million one-time gain on the sale of a technology investment, net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2024 were $3.8 billion, or $13.86 per diluted share. Excluding mark-to-market losses of $50.2 million on technology investments, a $65.0 million write-off of one of our non-public technology investments and other one-time items, net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2023 were $4.1 billion or $14.25 per diluted share.\nFinancial information relating to our operations was as follows:\nYear ended November 30, 2024\n(In thousands)\nHomebuilding\nFinancial \nServices\nMultifamily\nLennar \nOther\nCorporate\nTotal\nRevenues:\nSales of homes\n$\n33,778,149 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n33,778,149 \nSales of land\n93,384 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n93,384 \nOther revenues\n34,893 \n1,109,263 \n411,537 \n14,226 \n— \n1,569,919 \nTotal revenues\n33,906,426 \n1,109,263 \n411,537 \n14,226 \n— \n35,441,452 \nCosts and expenses:\nCosts of homes sold\n26,255,353 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n26,255,353 \nCosts of land sold\n73,802 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n73,802 \nSelling, general and administrative\n2,480,309 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n2,480,309 \nOther costs and expenses\n— \n532,079 \n521,455 \n79,495 \n— \n1,133,029 \nTotal costs and expenses\n28,809,464 \n532,079 \n521,455 \n79,495 \n— \n29,942,493 \nEquity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated entities\n66,448 \n— \n150,753 \n(53,102)\n— \n164,099 \nOther income, net and other gains\n178,842 \n— \n1,800 \n45,224 \n— \n225,866 \nLennar Other unrealized gains from technology investments\n— \n— \n— \n25,180 \n— \n25,180 \nOperating earnings (loss)\n5,342,252\n \n577,184\n \n42,635\n \n(47,967)\n—\n \n5,914,104\n \nCorporate general and administrative expenses\n— \n— \n— \n— \n648,986 \n648,986 \nCharitable foundation contribution\n— \n— \n— \n— \n80,210 \n80,210 \nEarnings (loss) before income taxes\n$\n5,342,252\n \n577,184\n \n42,635\n \n(47,967)\n(729,196)\n5,184,908\n \n28\nTable of \nContents\nYear ended November 30, 2023\n(In thousands)\nHomebuilding\nFinancial \nServices\nMultifamily\nLennar \nOther\nCorporate\nTotal\nRevenues:\nSales of homes\n$\n32,459,129 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n32,459,129 \nSales of land\n109,963 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n109,963 \nOther revenues\n91,895 \n976,859 \n573,485 \n22,035 \n— \n1,664,274 \nTotal revenues\n32,660,987 \n976,859 \n573,485 \n22,035 \n— \n34,233,366 \nCosts and expenses:\nCosts of homes sold\n24,900,470 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n24,900,470 \nCosts of land sold\n92,142 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n92,142 \nSelling, general and administrative\n2,231,033 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n2,231,033 \nOther costs and expenses\n— \n467,398 \n573,658 \n27,681 \n— \n1,068,737 \nTotal costs and expenses\n27,223,645 \n467,398 \n573,658 \n27,681 \n— \n28,292,382 \nEquity in losses from unconsolidated entities\n(3,886)\n— \n(52,073)\n(88,651)\n— \n(144,610)\nOther income (expense), net and other gains (losses)\n94,251 \n— \n1,595 \n(65,329)\n— \n30,517 \nLennar Other unrealized losses from technology investments\n— \n— \n— \n(50,162)\n— \n(50,162)\nOperating earnings (loss)\n5,527,707\n \n509,461\n \n(50,651)\n(209,788)\n—\n \n5,776,729\n \nCorporate general and administrative expenses\n— \n— \n— \n— \n501,338 \n501,338 \nCharitable foundation contribution\n— \n— \n— \n— \n73,087 \n73,087 \nEarnings (loss) before income taxes\n$\n5,527,707\n \n509,461\n \n(50,651)\n(209,788)\n(574,425)\n5,202,304\n \n2024 versus 2023\nRevenues from home sales increased 4% in the year ended November 30, 2024 to $33.8 billion from $32.5 billion in the year ended November 30, 2023. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 10% increase in the number of home deliveries, partially offset by a 5% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 80,210 homes in the year ended November 30, 2024 from 73,087 homes in the year ended November 30, 2023. The average sales price of homes delivered was $423,000 in the year ended November 30, 2024, compared to $446,000 in the year ended November 30, 2023. The decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in the year ended November 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to pricing to market through an increased use of incentives and product mix.\nGross margins on home sales were $7.5 billion, or 22.3%, in the year ended November 30, 2024, compared to $7.6 billion, or 23.3%, in the year ended November 30, 2023. During the year ended November 30, 2024, gross margins decreased primarily because revenue per square foot decreased while land costs increased year over year, which was partially offset by a decrease in costs per square foot due to lower costs of materials as we continued to focus on construction cost savings.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $2.5 billion in the year ended November 30, 2024, compared to $2.2 billion in the year ended November 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.3% in the year ended November 30, 2024, from 6.9% in the year ended November 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in professional expenses, insurance costs and digital marketing and advertising costs to generate more direct sales.\nDuring the years ended November 30, 2024 and 2023, our homebuilding operating earnings included $164.8 million and $141.2 million of interest income, respectively, due to an increase in cash balances and higher interest rates. During the year ended November 30, 2023, this was partially offset by an impairment of $36.8 million of an investment in a joint venture.\nOperating earnings for our Financial Services segment were $574.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2024, compared to operating earnings of $507.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2023.The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to higher lock volume because of an increase in capture rate and deliveries. There was also an increase in profitability from our title business due to higher volume and productivity as a result of continued implementation of technology initiatives.\nOperating earnings for the Multifamily segment were $43.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2024, compared to operating loss of $50.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2023. The increase in operating earnings was due to a $179.0 million one-time net gain from the sale of assets in our LMV Fund I, partially offset by a one-time $90.0 million write-down of \n29\nTable of \nContents\nnoncore assets as we focus on monetizing these assets. Operating loss for the Lennar Other segment was $46.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2024, compared to an operating loss of $211.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2023. The Lennar Other operating loss for the year ended November 30, 2024 was primarily related to operating losses from certain strategic investments, which were partially offset by $25.2 million of mark-to-market gains on our publicly traded technology investments and a $46.5 million one-time gain on the sale of a technology investment. Lennar Other operating loss for the year ended November 30, 2023 was primarily due to negative mark-to-market adjustments of $50.2 million on our publicly traded technology investments and a $65.0 million write-off of one of our non-public technology investments.\nFor the years ended November 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a tax provision of $1.2 billion in each period, which resulted in an overall effective income tax rate of 23.6% and 24.0%, respectively. Our overall effective income tax rate was slightly lower than last year, primarily due to additional tax credits recognized during 2024.\nHomebuilding Segments \nAt November 30, 2024, our Homebuilding operating segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in:\nEast:\n Alabama, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania\nCentral:\n Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland,

Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners.\nHomebuilding East\n:\n Revenues from home sales decreased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment except in New Jersey, which was partially offset by an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Alabama, Florida and Pennsylvania was primarily due to pricing to market and product mix. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in New Jersey was primarily due to product mix. The increase in the number of home deliveries in Alabama, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania was primarily due to an increase in the number of active communities. For the year ended November 30, 2024, a decrease in revenues per square foot was partially offset by a decrease in costs per square foot. In addition, land costs increased year over year. Overall, this resulted in a decrease in gross margin percentage of home deliveries.\nHomebuilding Central:\n Revenues from home sales increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment except in Illinois and Maryland. The increase in the number of home deliveries in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia was primarily due to an increase in the number of active communities.

For the year ended November 30, 2024, a decrease in revenues per square foot was partially offset by a decrease in costs per square foot. In addition, land costs increased year over year. Overall, the gross margin percentage of home deliveries decreased year over year. \nHomebuilding West: \nRevenues from home sales increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment except in Colorado, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Arizona, Colorado and Washington. The increase in the number of home deliveries in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington was primarily due to an increase in the number \n32\nTable of \nContents\nof active communities. The decrease in the number of home deliveries in Colorado was primarily due to a decrease in the number of active communities due to the timing of opening and closing of communities. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Arizona, Colorado and Washington was primarily due to pricing to market through an increased use of incentives and product mix. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Utah was primarily due to product mix. For the year ended November 30, 2024, an increase in revenues per square foot and a decrease in costs per square foot resulted in an increase in gross margin percentage of home deliveries. In addition, land costs increased year over year. \nFinancial Services Segment\nOur Financial Services reportable segment primarily provides mortgage financing, title and closing services primarily for buyers of our homes, as well as property and casualty insurance. The segment also originates and sells into securitizations commercial mortgage loans through its LMF Commercial business. Our Financial Services segment sells substantially all of the residential loans it originates within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, the majority of which are sold on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements.\nThe following table sets forth selected financial and operational information related to the residential mortgage and title activities of our Financial Services segment:\nYears Ended November 30,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nDollar value of mortgages originated\n$\n19,845,000\n \n17,395,000 \nNumber of mortgages originated\n54,600\n \n47,000 \nMortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers\n84%\n81%\nNumber of title and closing service transactions\n82,400\n \n74,900 \nAt November 30, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of Financial Services' commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\") was $135.6 million and $140.7 million, respectively. Details of these securities and related debt are within Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLMF Commercial \nLMF Commercial originates and sells into securitizations first mortgage loans, which are secured by income producing commercial properties.

Our Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets.\nOriginally, our Multifamily segment focused on building multifamily properties and selling them shortly after they were completed. However, more recently we have focused on creating and participating in funds that build multifamily properties with the intention of retaining them after they are completed.\nThe following table provides information related to our investment in the Multifamily segment:\nAt November 30,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nMultifamily investments in unconsolidated entities\n$\n503,303\n \n599,852 \nLennar's net investment in Multifamily\n1,116,295\n \n1,095,218 \nNumber of operating properties/investments sold through joint ventures\n34\n \n— \nLennar's share of gains on the sale of operating properties/investments\n219,148\n \n— \nThe Multifamily segment manages and has investments in Multifamily Venture Fund I (the \"LMV I\") and Multifamily Venture Fund II LP (the \"LMV II\"), which are long-term multifamily development investment vehicles involved in the \n33\nTable of \nContents\ndevelopment, construction and ownership of class-A multifamily rental properties. Details of each as of and during the year ended November 30, 2024 are included below: \nNovember 30, 2024\n(In thousands)\nLMV I\nLMV II\nLennar's carrying value of investments\n$\n126,784 \n228,496 \nEquity commitments\n2,204,016 \n1,257,700 \nEquity commitments called\n2,154,328 \n1,218,619 \nLennar's equity commitments\n504,016 \n381,000 \nLennar's equity commitments called\n500,381 \n368,170 \nLennar's remaining commitments (1)\n3,635 \n12,830 \nDistributions to Lennar\n199,519 \n12,820 \n(1)\nWhile there are remaining commitments with LMV I and LMV II, there are no plans for additional capital calls. \nAs of November 30, 2023, there were 38 rental operation projects in LMV I. During the second half of fiscal year 2024, the LMV I partners decided to liquidate and sell all of the individual rental operation projects of LMV I as the fund has come to the end of its contractual life. In the second half of 2024, 33 LMV I rental operation projects were sold to various third party buyers. We recognized a net gain of $211.5 million on the sale of these rental operation projects which was recorded as equity in earnings (losses) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we received net cash distributions of $199.5 million.\nOur Multifamily segment had equity investments in unconsolidated entities. The breakout of the Multifamily segment's equity investments in unconsolidated entities and the development activities by stage were as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAt November 30, 2024\nUnder construction/owned\n8 \nPartially completed and leasing\n11 \nCompleted and operating\n31 \nTotal unconsolidated joint ventures\n50 \nTotal development costs\n$\n6,931,432 \nAs of November 30, 2024, our Multifamily segment also had a pipeline of potential future projects, which were under contract or had letters of intent, totaling approximately $6.5 billion in anticipated development costs across a number of states that will be developed primarily by unconsolidated entities.\n34\nTable of \nContents\nLennar Other Segment\nOur Lennar Other segment includes fund investments we retained subsequent to our sale of the Rialto investment and asset management platform as well as strategic investments in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industries to better serve homebuyers and homeowners and increase efficiencies. As of November 30, 2024 and 2023, our balance sheet had $894.9 million and $657.9 million, respectively, of assets in the Lennar Other segment, which included investments in unconsolidated entities of $379.4 million and $276.2 million, respectively. We have investments in Blend Labs, Inc. (\"Blend Labs\"), Hippo Holdings, Inc. (\"Hippo\"), Opendoor Technologies, Inc. (\"Opendoor\"), SmartRent, Inc. (\"SmartRent\"), Sonder Holdings, Inc. (\"Sonder\") and Sunnova Energy International, Inc. (\"Sunnova\"), which are held at market and the carrying value of which will therefore change depending on the fair value of our shareholdings in those entities on the last day of each quarter. All the investments are accounted for as investments in equity securities which are held at fair value and the changes in fair values are recognized through earnings. The following is a detail of Lennar Other unrealized gains (losses) from mark-to-market adjustments on our technology investments: \nYears Ended November 30,\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\nBlend Labs (BLND)\n$\n9,474\n \n(130)\nHippo (HIPO)\n73,243\n \n(19,210)\nOpendoor (OPEN)\n(12,587)\n21,762 \nSmartRent (SMRT)\n(11,609)\n5,914 \nSonder (SOND)\n15\n \n(700)\nSunnova (NOVA)\n(33,356)\n(57,798)\nLennar Other unrealized gains (losses) from technology investments\n$\n25,180\n \n(50,162)\nAt November 30, 2024 and 2023, Lennar Other owned CMBS with carrying values of $40.6 million and $38.0 million, respectively. These securities were purchased at discount rates ranging from 33% to 55% with coupon rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.4%, stated and assumed final distribution dates between September 2025 and March 2026, and stated maturity dates between September 2058 and March 2059. We review changes in estimated cash flows periodically to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred on our CMBS. Based on management’s assessment, no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended November 30, 2024 and 2023. We classify these securities as held-for-sale at November 30, 2024 and 2023. \nFinancial Condition and Capital Resources\nAt November 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash related to our homebuilding, financial services, multifamily and other operations of $5.0 billion, compared to $6.6 billion at November 30, 2023.\nWe finance all of our activities including homebuilding, financial services, multifamily, other and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations, debt issuances and investor funds as well as cash borrowed under our warehouse lines of credit and our unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). At November 30, 2024, we had $4.7 billion of Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under our $2.9 billion Credit Facility, thereby approximately $7.6 billion of available capacity.\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nDuring 2024 and 2023, cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.4 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. During 2024, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by our net earnings and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $380 million. This was offset by an increase in inventories due to our growth strategy, strategic land purchases, land development and construction costs of $285 million, an increase in deposits and pre-acquisition costs on real estate of $1.6 billion as we increased the percentage of controlled homesites, and an increase in loans held-for-sale of $218 million primarily related to the sale of loans originated by our Financial Services segment.\n During 2023, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by our net earnings and $2.3 billion decrease in inventories due to our strategy of controlling more homesites and acquiring finished homesites, thus reducing the amount of spend related to inventory. This was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities $626 million, primarily due to the payment of income taxes, an increase in receivables of $329 million, an increase in deposits and preacquisition costs on real estate of $296 million as we increased the percentage of controlled homesites, and an increase in loan held-for-sale of $367 million primarily related to the sale of loans originated by our Financial Services segment.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nDuring 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities totaled $303 million and $177 million, respectively. During 2024, our cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash contributions of $426 million to unconsolidated entities, which primarily included (1) $222 million to Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $182 million to Lennar Other \n35\nTable of \nContents\nunconsolidated entities, and (3) $21 million to Multifamily unconsolidated entities. This was partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $231 million, which primarily included (1) $117 million from Multifamily unconsolidated entities, (2) $61 million from Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, and (3) $54 million from our Lennar Other unconsolidated entities.\nDuring 2023, our cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash contributions of $201 million to unconsolidated entities, which primarily included (1) $94 million to Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $81 million to Lennar Other unconsolidated entities, and (3) $27 million to Multifamily unconsolidated entities. This was partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $100 million, which primarily included (1) $70 million from Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, and (2) $29 million from our Lennar Other unconsolidated entities.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nDuring 2024 and 2023, our cash used in financing activities totaled $3.7 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. During 2024, our cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the (1) $2.3 billion of repurchases of our common stock, which included $2.2 billion of repurchases under our repurchase program and $87 million of repurchases related to our equity compensation plan; (2) $549 million of dividend payments; (3) $233 million of net repayments under our Financial Services' warehouse facilities; (4) redemption of $454 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due April 2024; (5) $100 million of partial repurchase of our 4.75% senior notes due 2027; and (6) $14 million of net payments from liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned due to activity with land banks.\nDuring 2023, our cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the (1) redemption of $378 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% senior notes due December 2023, (2) redemption of $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% senior notes due November 2024, (3) $296 million combined of partial repurchase of our 4.500% senior notes due 2024 and 4.75% senior notes due 2027, (4) $105 million principal payment on notes payable and other borrowings, (5) repurchase of our common stock for $1.2 billion, which included $1.1 billion of repurchase of our stock under our repurchase program and $73 million of repurchases related to our equity compensation plan, (6) $431 million of dividend payments, and (7) $381 million of net payments from liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned due to land sales to land banks. These were partially offset by (1) $29 million of net borrowings under our Financial Services warehouse facilities, and (2) receipts related to noncontrolling interest of $21 million.\nDebt to total capital ratios are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our Homebuilding operations. Homebuilding debt to total capital and net Homebuilding debt to total capital were calculated as follows:\nAt November 30,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nHomebuilding debt\n$\n2,258,283\n \n2,816,482 \nStockholders’ equity\n27,870,135\n \n26,580,664 \nTotal capital\n$\n30,128,418\n \n29,397,146 \nHomebuilding debt to total capital\n7.5%\n9.6%\nHomebuilding debt\n$\n2,258,283\n \n2,816,482 \nLess: Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents\n4,662,643\n \n6,273,724 \nNet Homebuilding debt\n$\n(2,404,360)\n(3,457,242)\nNet Homebuilding debt to total capital (1)\n(9.4)%\n(15.0)%\n(1)\nNet homebuilding debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net homebuilding debt (homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). Our management believes the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations. However, because net homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement our GAAP results.\nAt November 30, 2024, Homebuilding debt to total capital was lower compared to November 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in stockholders' equity due to net earnings and a decrease in Homebuilding debt due to debt paydowns and debt repurchases, partially offset by share repurchases.\nWe are continually exploring various types of transactions to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, take advantage of market opportunities and increase our revenues and earnings. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness, the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of homebuilders and other companies, the purchase or sale of assets or lines of business, the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, and/or the pursuit of other financing alternatives. In connection with some \n36\nTable of \nContents\nof our non-homebuilding businesses, we are also considering other types of transactions such as sales, restructurings, joint ventures, spin-offs or initial public offerings as we continue to move back towards being a pure play homebuilding company. We have announced an intention to spin off, subject to market conditions, our multifamily and single-family rental asset management businesses and some of our investment assets.\nWe are currently preparing to spin off (the “Millrose Spin-Off”) a wholly owned subsidiary for Lennar, Millrose Properties Inc. (“Millrose”) into an independent, publicly traded company that will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, we plan to contribute to Millrose, in exchange for all outstanding shares of its common stock, a significant portion of our undeveloped, partially developed, and some of our fully developed, land, with an expected total aggregate value between $5.0 billion and $6.0 billion, as well as approximately $1.0 billion of cash. To consummate the Millrose Spin-Off, our Board declared a stock dividend on January 10, 2025, pursuant to which we will distribute to Lennar’s stockholders of record as of January 21, 2025 approximately 80% of the total outstanding number of shares of Millrose common stock on February 7, 2025. The goal of the Millrose Spin-off is to generally complete our migration to an asset-light operating model by spinning off a significant portion of our land assets from our balance sheet. We expect Millrose to qualify as a real estate investment trust that will acquire and develop land and will deliver fully developed homesites under a land option contract on a just in time basis for Lennar and potentially other homebuilders. Millrose is expected to maintain a business model with a self-sustaining, recycling source of land acquisition and development capital. Millrose is expected to be responsible for paying to develop the undeveloped and partially developed land into homesites up to a certain pre-negotiated budget, with Lennar performing the actual construction work. Lennar will have options to purchase the homesites in accordance with pre-set takedown schedules when Lennar expects to be ready to build homes on them. Millrose is expected to use option exercise proceeds to purchase additional land designated by Lennar or other homebuilders in the future, usually giving Lennar or the other homebuilders options to purchase the land when it is developed.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Rausch Coleman Homes, a residential homebuilder based in Fayetteville, Arkansas. With this acquisition, we will expand our footprint into new markets in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kansas and Missouri while adding to our existing footprint in Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama and Florida. As previously disclosed in Millrose’s registration statement on Form S-11, in connection with furthering our land light strategy, we intend to assign the purchase of Rausch Coleman's land assets (the “Rausch Land Assets”) to Millrose. Similar to the other land assets, Lennar expects to contribute to Millrose in connection with the Millrose Spin-Off, Lennar expects to enter into options to purchase the developed Rausch Land Assets in accordance with pre-set takedown schedules. We are expecting the acquisition to be completed in the first quarter of 2025.\nOur Homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable are summarized within Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIn November 30, 2024, we amended and restated the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility. The maximum available borrowings on our Credit Facility were as follows:\n(In thousands)\nAt November 30, 2024\nCommitments - maturing in May 2027\n$\n225,000 \nCommitments - maturing in November 2029\n2,650,000 \nTotal commitments\n$\n2,875,000 \nAccordion feature\n625,000 \nTotal maximum borrowings capacity\n$\n3,500,000 \nThe proceeds available under the Credit Facility, which are subject to specified conditions for borrowing, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The credit agreement also provides that up to $477.5 million in commitments may be used for letters of credit. As of both November 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. In addition to the Credit Facility, we have other letter of credit facilities with different financial institutions.\nWe often post letters of credit instead of making cash deposits for option contracts and for similar purposes. We often are required to post surety bonds to guarantee completion of projects, particularly when municipal authorities are involved. Our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds are described below:\nAt November 30,\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\nPerformance letters of credit\n$\n1,668,061\n \n1,404,541 \nFinancial letters of credit\n745,578\n \n417,976 \nSurety bonds\n5,140,432\n \n4,508,428 \nAnticipated future costs primarily for site improvements related to performance surety bonds\n2,766,088\n \n2,499,680 \n37\nTable of \nContents\nOur Homebuilding average debt outstanding and the average rates of interest were as follows:\nAt November 30,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nHomebuilding average debt outstanding \n$\n2,449,576\n \n3,688,363 \nAverage interest rate\n4.8%\n4.9%\nInterest incurred\n$\n129,310\n \n187,640 \n Under the Credit Facility agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), we are required to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio and either a liquidity or an interest coverage ratio. These ratios are calculated per the Credit Facility agreement, which involves adjustments to GAAP financial measures. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are required to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth of $10.0 billion. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio that shall not exceed 60%. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are also required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. We believe that we were in compliance with our debt covenants at November 30, 2024.\nThe following summarizes our required debt covenants and our actual levels or ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the Credit Agreement as of November 30, 2024:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCovenant Level\nLevel Achieved as of November 30, 2024\nMinimum net worth test\n$\n10,000,000 \n21,384,969 \nMaximum leverage ratio\n60.0%\n(6.6)%\nLiquidity test (1)\n1.00 \n(139.00)\n(1)\nWe are only required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio of equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. Although we are in compliance with our debt covenants for both calculations, we have only disclosed our liquidity test.\nAt November 30, 2024, the Financial Services segment had warehouse facilities, all of which were 364-day repurchase facilities and were used to fund residential mortgages or commercial mortgages for LMF Commercial as follows:\nMaximum Aggregate Commitment\n(In thousands)\nCommitted Amount\nUncommitted Amount\nTotal\nResidential facilities maturing:\nApril 2025\n$\n250,000 \n250,000 \n500,000 \nJune 2025\n1,400,000 \n— \n1,400,000 \nAugust 2025\n325,000 \n325,000 \n650,000 \nOctober 2025\n100,000 \n100,000 \n200,000 \nDecember 2026\n375,000 \n— \n375,000 \nTotal residential facilities\n$\n2,450,000 \n675,000 \n3,125,000 \nLMF commercial facilities maturing:\nDecember 2024 (1)\n200,000 \n— \n200,000 \nJanuary 2025\n100,000 \n— \n100,000 \nTotal LMF commercial facilities\n$\n300,000 \n— \n300,000 \nTotal\n$\n3,425,000 \n(1)\nSubsequent to November 30, 2024, the maturity date was extended to December 2025.\nThe Financial Services segment uses residential mortgage loan warehouse facilities to finance its residential lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and the proceeds are collected. The facilities are non-recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. The LMF Commercial facilities finance LMF Commercial loan originations and securitization activities and were secured by up to 80% interests in the originated commercial loans financed.\n38\nTable of \nContents\nBorrowings and collateral under the facilities were as follows:\nAt November 30,\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\nBorrowings under the residential facilities\n$\n1,776,045\n \n2,020,187\nCollateral under the residential facilities\n1,837,833\n \n2,097,020\nBorrowings under the LMF Commercial facilities\n28,747\n \n12,525\nIf the facilities are not renewed or replaced, the borrowings under the lines of credit will be repaid by selling the mortgage loans held-for-sale to investors and by collecting receivables on loans sold but not yet paid for. Without the facilities, the Financial Services segment would have to use cash from operations and other funding sources to finance its lending activities.\nChanges in Capital Structure\nIn January 2024, our Board authorized an increase to our stock repurchase program to enable us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion in value of our outstanding Class A or Class B common stock. Repurchases are authorized to be made in open-market or private transactions. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date. This authorization was in addition to what was remaining of our March 2022 stock repurchase program. At November 30, 2024, we have a remaining authorization to repurchase $3.4 billion in value of our Class A or B common stock. Repurchases are authorized to be made in open-market or private transactions. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.\nThe following table provides information about our repurchases of Class A and Class B common stock: \nYears Ended November 30,\n2024\n2023\n(Dollars in thousands, except price per share)\nClass A\nClass B\nClass A\nClass B\nShares repurchased\n11,942,725\n \n1,612,501\n \n7,499,660 \n2,500,340 \nTotal purchase price\n$\n1,906,049\n \n$\n243,860\n \n$\n851,502 \n$\n248,835 \nAverage price per share\n$\n159.60\n \n$\n151.23\n \n$\n113.54 \n$\n99.52 \n During the year ended November 30, 2024, treasury stock increased by 14.2 million shares primarily due to our repurchase of 13.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock through our stock repurchase program. During the year ended November 30, 2023, treasury stock increased by 11.3 million shares primarily due to our repurchase of 10.0 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock through our stock repurchase program.\nDuring the years ended November 30, 2024 and 2023, our Class A and Class B common stockholders received an aggregate per share annual dividend of $2.00 and $1.50, respectively. On January 14, 2025, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share on both our Class A and Class B common stock, payable on February 12, 2025 to holders of record at the close of business on January 29, 2025.\nBased on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nCurrently, certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries, which are primarily our homebuilding subsidiaries, are guaranteeing all our senior notes. The guarantees are full and unconditional.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes require that, if any of our 100% owned subsidiaries, other than our finance company subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries, directly or indirectly guarantee at least $75 million principal amount of debt of Lennar Corporation (other than senior notes), those subsidiaries must also guarantee Lennar Corporation’s obligations with regard to its senior notes. Included in the following tables as part of “Obligors” together with Lennar Corporation are subsidiary entities that are not finance company subsidiaries or foreign subsidiaries and were guaranteeing the senior notes because at November 30, 2024 they were guaranteeing Lennar Corporation's letter of credit facilities and its Credit Facility, disclosed in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The guarantees are full, unconditional and joint and several and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly or indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. A subsidiary's guarantee of Lennar senior notes will be suspended at any time when it is not directly or indirectly guaranteeing at least $75 million principal amount of debt of Lennar Corporation (other than senior notes), and a subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed.\n39\nTable of \nContents\nSupplemental information for the Obligors, which excludes non-guarantor subsidiaries and intercompany transactions, at November 30, 2024 is included in the following tables. Intercompany balances and transactions within the Obligors have been eliminated and amounts attributable to the Obligor’s investment in consolidated subsidiaries that have not issued or guaranteed the senior notes have been excluded. Amounts due from and transactions with non-guarantor subsidiaries and related parties are separately disclosed:\nAt  November 30,\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\nDue from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n18,396,060\n \n22,020,227 \nEquity method investments\n1,078,635\n \n986,508 \nTotal assets\n50,251,091\n \n45,830,841 \nTotal liabilities\n10,067,424\n \n9,181,456 \n(In thousands)\nYear Ended November 30, 2024\nTotal revenues\n$\n32,600,847 \nOperating earnings\n5,025,356 \nEarnings before income taxes\n4,312,161 \nNet earnings attributable to Lennar\n3,294,043 \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nHomebuilding - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWe regularly monitor the results of our Homebuilding, Multifamily, and Lennar Other unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. We also monitor the performance of Homebuilding joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with their debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investments. We believe that substantially all of the joint ventures were in compliance with their debt covenants at November 30, 2024, except for the other-than-temporary impairment which is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt November 30, 2024, we had equity investments in 51 active Homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities (of which 5 had recourse debt, 14 had non-recourse debt and 32 had no debt), compared to 48 active Homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2023. Historically, we have invested in unconsolidated entities that acquired and developed land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers. Through these entities, we have primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, has enabled us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners’ capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners. Details regarding these investments, balances and debt are included in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Homebuilding unconsolidated entities (\"JVs\") debt as per current debt arrangements as of November 30, 2024. It does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances.

We invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land to construct multifamily rental properties. Through these entities, we are focusing on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. Participants in these joint ventures have been financial partners. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our development and construction expertise with access to our partners’ capital. Each joint venture is governed by an operating agreement that provides significant substantive participating voting rights on major decisions to our partners.\nThe Multifamily segment manages and has investments in LMV I, LMV II and Canada Pension Plan Investments Fund, which are long-term multifamily development investment vehicles involved in the development, construction and ownership of class-A multifamily assets. During the year ended November 30, 2024, the LMV I fund sold some of its individual rental operation projects which resulted in a net gain of $211.5 million and received net cash distributions of $199.5 million. The remaining LMV I rental operation projects are expected to be monetized in the near term. Details of each as of and during the year ended November 30, 2024 are included in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe regularly monitor the results of our Multifamily unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. We also monitor the performance of Multifamily joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. We believe all of the joint ventures were in compliance with their debt covenants at November 30, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Multifamily unconsolidated entities debt as per current debt arrangements as of November 30, 2024.

We periodically receive advance distributions related to the carried interests in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income to the carried interests. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks but reduce future carried interest payments to which we become entitled from the applicable funds and were recorded as equity in earnings (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations. Our investment in the Rialto funds totaled $140.1 million and $148.7 million as of November 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAs of November 30, 2024 and 2023, we had strategic technology investments in unconsolidated entities of $239.3 million and $127.5 million respectively, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our strategic technology investments through our LEN\nX\n business help to enhance the homebuying and home ownership experience, and help us stay at the forefront of homebuilding innovation.\nOption Contracts\nWe often obtain access to land through option contracts, which generally enable us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land banks) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the options. Since fiscal year 2020, we have been increasing the percentage of our total homesites that we control through options rather than own. \nAs part of our focus on strategic relationships to further enhance our land lighter strategy, at the end of fiscal year 2020 we entered into an arrangement with various land bank investor groups. Under the arrangement, in most instances when we want to acquire a property for use in our for-sale single-family home business, we will offer the investor group the opportunity to acquire the property and give us an option to purchase all or a portion of it back in the future, if it is mutually beneficial to both parties. To the extent the investor group does not elect to purchase properties we identify, we can utilize our other investor relationships to have other investor groups purchase the land or we can purchase it directly. The arrangement with the investor group, together with existing and other strategic partnerships we are discussing, are significant steps in our strategy to migrate \n41\nTable of \nContents\nto a higher percentage of our homesites which we control but do not own, which we expect will result in greater cash flow and higher returns on assets and equity.\nThe table below indicates the number of homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties or unconsolidated JVs (i.e., controlled homesites) and homesites owned at November 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNovember 30, 2024\nControlled Homesites\nOwned\nHomesites\nTotal\nHomesites\nYears of Supply Owned (1)\nEast\n95,725 \n18,437 \n114,162 \nCentral\n92,469 \n28,489 \n120,958 \nTexas\n117,749 \n15,357 \n133,106 \nWest\n82,878 \n21,254 \n104,132 \nOther\n4,828 \n1,891 \n6,719 \nTotal homesites\n393,649 \n85,428 \n479,077 \n1.1 \n% of total homesites\n82 \n%\n18 \n%\nNovember 30, 2023\nControlled Homesites\nOwned\nHomesites\nTotal\nHomesites\nYears of Supply Owned (1)\nEast\n85,601 \n20,441 \n106,042 \nCentral\n65,053 \n32,264 \n97,317 \nTexas\n90,961 \n21,790 \n112,751 \nWest\n62,674 \n23,429 \n86,103 \nOther\n5,411 \n1,891 \n7,302 \nTotal homesites\n309,700 \n99,815 \n409,515 \n1.4 \n% of total homesites\n76 \n%\n24 \n%\n(1)\nBased on trailing twelve months of home deliveries.\n \nDetails on option contracts and related consolidated inventory not owned and exposure are included in Note 1 and Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at November 30, 2024:\nPayments Due by Period\n(In thousands)\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1 to 3\nyears\n3 to 5\nyears\nMore than\n5 years\nHomebuilding - senior notes and other debts payable (1)\n$\n2,257,440 \n532,097 \n1,683,134 \n25,562 \n16,647 \nLand purchase contract obligations (2)\n1,507,964 \n582,683 \n830,565 \n94,716 \n— \nFinancial Services - notes and other debts payable\n1,930,956 \n1,800,944 \n3,848 \n— \n126,164 \nInterest commitments under interest bearing debt (3)\n230,794 \n109,869 \n116,132 \n3,737 \n1,056 \nOperating lease obligations\n293,806 \n98,143 \n100,150 \n50,273 \n45,240 \nOther contractual obligations (4)\n20,374 \n20,374 \n— \n— \n— \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n6,241,334 \n3,144,110 \n2,733,829 \n174,288 \n189,107 \n(1)\nThe amounts presented in the table above exclude debt issuance costs and any discounts/premiums and purchase accounting adjustments.\n(2)\nAmount includes purchase commitments due to land banks upon maturity of the contracts.

Option contracts for the purchase of land generally reduce our financial risk and costs of capital associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2024, we had access to 393,649 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2024, we had $3.5 billion of non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and had posted $341.8 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts.\nAt November 30, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $2.4 billion (which included the $341.8 million of letters of credit discussed above). Details on our letters of credit outstanding and outstanding surety bonds are included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n42\nTable of \nContents\nOur Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $2.8 billion at November 30, 2024. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2024. A significant portion of these commitments had a remaining period of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers or borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOur Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") forward commitments, option contracts, futures contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage-related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts, futures contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and the option contracts. At November 30, 2024, we had open commitments amounting to $3.8 billion to sell forward contracts, which include MBS and interest rate swaps, with varying settlement dates through February 2025 and open future contracts in the amount of $2.3 million with the varying settlement dates through March 2025.\nThe following sections discuss market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business:\nMarket and Financing Risk\nWe finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, Multifamily activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and debt, as well as borrowings under our Credit Facility and warehouse repurchase facilities. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the options. We try to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believe to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Although we believe our land underwriting standards are conservative, we do not anticipate a severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes in the near future.\nSeasonality\nWe historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second and third fiscal quarters and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, a variety of factors can alter seasonal patterns.\nInterest Rates and Changing Prices\nInflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and increase the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates as well as increased material and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in materials and labor costs would be particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices. Conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive list of new accounting pronouncements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our \n43\nTable of \nContents\nconsolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application.\nGoodwill\nWe recorded a significant amount of goodwill in connection with the 2018 acquisition of CalAtlantic. We record goodwill associated with acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable assets acquired. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, \nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other\n, we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis. We have the option to perform a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events. We believe that the accounting estimate for goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units. We estimate fair value through various valuation methods, including the use of discounted expected future cash flows of each reporting unit. The expected future cash flows for each segment are significantly impacted by current market conditions. If these market conditions and resulting expected future cash flows for each reporting unit decline significantly, the actual results for each segment could differ from our estimate, which would cause goodwill to be impaired. Our accounting for goodwill represents our best estimate of future events.\nHomebuilding Revenue Recognition\nHomebuilding revenues and related profits from sales of homes are recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the homebuyer. In order to promote sales of the homes, we may offer sales incentives to homebuyers. The types of incentives vary on a community-by-community basis and home-by-home basis. They include primarily price discounts on individual homes and financing incentives, all of which are reflected as a reduction of home sales revenues. Our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Cash proceeds from home closings held in escrow for our benefit, typically for approximately three days, are included in Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and disclosed in the notes to consolidated balance sheets. Contract liabilities include customer deposit liabilities related to sold but undelivered homes that are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties. Cash consideration from land sales is typically due on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied, and revenue is recognized as title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer.\nMultifamily Revenue Recognition\nOur Multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development, construction and property management of rental projects in joint ventures in which we have investments. As a result, our Multifamily segment earns and receives fees, which are generally based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs and a percentage of gross rental collections. These fees are recorded over the period in which the services are performed using an input method, which properly depicts the level of effort required to complete the management services. In addition, our Multifamily segment provides general contractor services for the construction of some of its rental projects and recognizes the revenue over the period in which the services are performed using an input method, which properly depicts the level of effort required to complete the construction services. These customer contracts require us to provide management and general contractor services which represents a performance obligation that we satisfy over time. Management fees and general contractor services in the Multifamily segment are included in Multifamily revenue. When the Multifamily segment acts as general contractor, it treats the entire construction cost as revenue and treats payments to subcontractors as expenses.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes and interest related to development and construction. We review our inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair value.\nIn conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the estimated fair value of the land itself.\n44\nTable of \nContents\nWe estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. We evaluate the historical performance of each of our communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above. \nSince the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the future.\nUsing all the available information, we calculate our best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. While many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each asset’s fair value depends on the community’s projected life and development stage.\nWe estimate the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. \nWe believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \nProduct Warranty\nAlthough we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to homebuyers to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWe strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties, (2) for construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers or (3) for the construction and sale of multifamily rental properties. Our Homebuilding partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. Additionally, in recent years, we have invested in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry in order to better serve homebuyers and homeowners and increase efficiencies. Our Multifamily partners are all financial partners.\nMost of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary or a de-facto agent, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and our pro-rata share of the entities’ earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated entities within each of the respective segments. For most unconsolidated entities, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions on a pro-rata basis based upon ownership percentages. However, certain Homebuilding unconsolidated entities and all of our Multifamily unconsolidated entities provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance.\nManagement looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence, or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether the entity is a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") or a voting interest entity and then whether we are the primary beneficiary or have \n45\nTable of \nContents\ncontrol or significant influence. We believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners.\nWe evaluate the long-lived assets in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity below its carrying amount has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\nThe evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities for other-than-temporary impairment includes certain critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions, (3) the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, and (4) various other factors. Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. \nWe believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from management’s assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future.\nConsolidation of Variable Interest Entities\nGAAP requires the assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, if we are the primary beneficiary at the inception of the entity or at a reconsideration event. Additionally, GAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which we have a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management services and development agreements between us and a VIE, (4) loans provided by us to a VIE or other partner and/or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. We examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIE’s executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs.\nGenerally, all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared among all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other partners. Generally, we purchase less than a majority of the JV’s assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at market.\nGenerally, our unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate if the other partner(s) lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity.
