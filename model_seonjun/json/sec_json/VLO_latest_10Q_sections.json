These non-GAAP financial measures include Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin; adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable); Refining segment adjusted operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense); and capital investments attributable to Valero. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods, to help assess our cash flows, and because we believe they provide useful information as discussed further below. See the tables in note (c) beginning on page \n57\n for reconciliations of Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin; adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable); and adjusted Refining operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also in note (c), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of such non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. See the table on page \n64\n for a reconciliation of capital investments attributable to Valero to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Beginning on page \n63\n, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information.\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nOverview\nBusiness Operations Update\nOur results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 were supported by strong worldwide demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels, while worldwide supply of those products remained constrained.\n \nOur results for the first nine months of 2025, however, were also impacted by the asset impairment loss of $1.1 billion ($877 million after taxes) associated with our operations in California, as described in Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe reported $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Valero stockholders for the third quarter of 2025 and the first nine months of 2025, respectively. Our operating results, including operating results by segment, are described in the following summary under “Third Quarter Results” and “First Nine Months Results,” and detailed descriptions can be found under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” beginning on page \n43\n.\nOur operations generated $3.8 billion of cash during the first nine months of 2025. In addition, we issued $650 million of 5.150 percent Senior Notes due February 15, 2030 during the first nine months of 2025, as described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The cash generated by our operations, along with the net proceeds from our debt issuance and cash on hand, was used to make $1.5 billion of capital investments in our business, return $2.6 billion to our stockholders through purchases of common stock for treasury and dividend payments, and repay $440 million of our public debt that matured in the first nine months of 2025. As a result of this and other activity, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased by $112 million during the first nine months of 2025 to $4.9 billion as of September 30, 2025. We had $9.9 billion in liquidity as of September 30, 2025. The components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows, capital investments, and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources can be found under “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” beginning on page \n61\n.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThird Quarter Results\nFor the third quarter of 2025, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $1.1 billion compared to $364 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase of $731 million was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $1.0 billion, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $294 million. The details of our operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income, where applicable, by segment and in total are reflected below (in millions). Adjusted operating income excludes the adjustments reflected in the tables in note (c) beginning on page \n57\n.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\nRefining segment:\nOperating income \n$\n1,610 \n$\n565 \n$\n1,045 \nAdjusted operating income \n1,665 \n568 \n1,097 \nRenewable Diesel segment:\nOperating income (loss)\n(28)\n35 \n(63)\nEthanol segment:\nOperating income\n183 \n153 \n30 \nTotal company:\nOperating income \n1,509 \n507 \n1,002 \nAdjusted operating income \n1,564 \n510 \n1,054 \nWhile our operating income increased by $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, adjusted operating income increased by $1.1 billion primarily due to the following:\n•\nRefining segment\n. Refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $1.1 billion primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate (primarily diesel) margins and an increase in throughput volumes, partially offset by a decline in crude oil and other feedstock differentials and increases in adjusted operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense.\n•\nRenewable Diesel segment. \nRenewable Diesel segment operating income decreased by $63 million\n \nprimarily due to higher feedstock costs and a decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by higher product prices (primarily renewable diesel).\n•\nEthanol segment.\n Ethanol segment operating income increased by $30 million primarily due to higher ethanol and corn related co-product prices and an increase in production volumes, partially offset by higher corn prices and an increase in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense).\n40\nTable of Contents\nFirst Nine Months Results\nFor the first nine months of 2025, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $1.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion for the first nine months of 2024. The decrease of $1.3 billion was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of $1.8 billion, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $322 million and a decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $297 million. The details of our operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income, where applicable, by segment and in total are reflected below (in millions).

Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by $7 million primarily due to a decline in crude oil and other feedstock differentials and increases in adjusted operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by higher gasoline, distillate (primarily diesel), and other product margins and an increase in throughput volumes.\n•\nRenewable Diesel segment. \nRenewable Diesel segment operating income decreased by $585 million primarily due to higher feedstock costs and a decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by higher product prices (primarily renewable diesel) and a decrease in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense).\n•\nEthanol segment.\n Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by $38 million primarily due to higher corn prices and an increase in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), partially offset by higher ethanol prices and an increase in production volumes.\n41\nTable of Contents\nOutlook\nMany uncertainties remain with respect to the supply and demand balances in petroleum-based product markets worldwide. While it is difficult to predict future worldwide economic activity and its resulting impact on product supply and demand, including the effects of tariffs thereon, we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2025.\n•\nGlobal demand for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel continues to rise, with demand for jet fuel outpacing other primary petroleum-based transportation fuels. As biofuel consumption increases at a slower pace than in recent years, petroleum-based transportation fuels account for a greater share of the overall increase in demand for finished products.\n•\nCombined light product (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) inventories across the U.S. and Europe remain low. Expected reductions in refining capacity in both regions, unplanned outages at Russian refineries due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and a prolonged ramp-up of new capacity in emerging markets continue to support utilization of remaining global refining capacity.\n•\nCrude oil differentials are expected to widen as a result of an increase in sour crude oil production from OPEC+ suppliers. However, potential sanction adjustments related to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela and the Russia-Ukraine conflict could result in increased volatility in the crude oil market and potentially impact crude oil differentials.\n•\nRenewable diesel demand is expected to remain consistent with current levels.\n•\nEthanol demand is expected to follow typical seasonal patterns.\n42\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables, including the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in note (c) beginning on page \n57\n, highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that directly impact our operations.

In connection with our plan to cease refining operations at the Benicia Refinery, we implemented a transition plan for eligible employees, which includes retention incentive payments and separation benefits. \n(b)\nIn March 2025, we approved a plan with respect to the operations at our Benicia Refinery and currently intend to cease refining operations by the end of April 2026. In addition, we considered strategic alternatives for our remaining operations in California. As a result, we evaluated the assets of the Benicia and Wilmington refineries for impairment as of March 31, 2025 and concluded that the carrying values of these assets were not recoverable. Therefore, we reduced the carrying values of the Benicia and Wilmington refineries to their estimated fair values and recognized a combined asset impairment loss of $1.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n(c)\nWe use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.\nWe have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.\n57\nTable of

The RVO cost is calculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class of renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the quotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels consumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding together the results of each calculation.\n(e)\nWe use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the Refining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who operate facilities similar to those included in \nour segments.\n60\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Liquidity\nOur liquidity consisted of the following as of September 30, 2025 (in millions):\nAvailable capacity from our committed facilities (a):\nValero Revolver\n$\n3,998 \nAccounts receivable sales facility\n1,300 \nTotal available capacity\n5,298 \nCash and cash equivalents (b)\n4,595 \nTotal liquidity\n$\n9,893 \n________________________\n(a)\nExcludes the committed facilities of the consolidated VIEs.\n(b)\nExcludes $169 million of cash and cash equivalents related to the consolidated VIEs that is for their use only.\nInformation about our outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 7, 2025, we issued $650 million of 5.150 percent Senior Notes due February 15, 2030. Proceeds from this debt issuance totaled $649 million before deducting the underwriting discount and other debt issuance costs. A portion of the net proceeds from this debt issuance was used for the repayment of our outstanding 3.65 percent Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 and 2.850 percent Senior Notes due April 15, 2025. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nWe believe we have sufficient funds from operations and from available capacity under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments over the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional cash through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.\n61\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nComponents of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\nCash flows provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n3,769 \n$\n5,613 \nInvesting activities\n(1,426)\n(1,437)\nFinancing activities:\nDebt issuance and\n \nborrowings\n5,999 \n5,473 \nRepayments of debt and finance lease obligations\n(5,913)\n(6,053)\nReturn to stockholders:\nPurchases of common stock for treasury\n(1,534)\n(2,616)\nCommon stock dividend payments\n(1,061)\n(1,045)\nReturn to stockholders\n(2,595)\n(3,661)\nOther financing activities\n79 \n(24)\nFinancing activities\n(2,430)\n(4,265)\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash\n199 \n19 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n112 \n$\n(70)\nCash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025\nIn the first nine months of 2025, we used the $3.8 billion of cash generated by our operations and the $6.0 billion from our debt issuance and borrowings to make $1.4 billion of investments in our business, repay $5.9 billion of debt and finance lease obligations, return $2.6 billion to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments, and increase our available cash on hand by $112 million. The debt issuance, borrowings, and repayments are described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs previously noted, our operations generated $3.8 billion of cash in the first nine months of 2025, primarily resulting from net income of $1.1 billion, noncash charges to income of $2.5 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $157 million. Noncash charges primarily included a $1.1 billion asset impairment loss associated with our operations in California, as described in Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and $2.3 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $288 million deferred income tax benefit. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 11 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.\nOur investing activities of $1.4 billion primarily consisted of $1.5 billion in capital investments, as defined on the following page under “Capital Investments,” of which $158 million related to capital investments made by DGD.\nCash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nIn the first nine months of 2024, we used the $5.6 billion of cash generated by our operations, $5.5 billion in debt borrowings, and $70 million of cash on hand to make $1.4 billion of investments in our business, repay $6.1 billion of debt and finance lease obligations, and return $3.7 billion to our stockholders \n62\nTable of Contents\nthrough purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments. The debt borrowings and repayments are described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs previously noted, our operations generated $5.6 billion of cash in the first nine months of 2024, driven primarily by net income of $2.6 billion, noncash charges to income of $2.2 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $795 million. Noncash charges primarily included $2.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 11 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.\nOur investing activities of $1.4 billion primarily consisted of $1.5 billion in capital investments, of which $260 million related to capital investments made by DGD.\nOur Capital Resources\nOur material cash requirements as of September 30, 2025 primarily consisted of working capital requirements, capital investments, contractual obligations, and other matters, as described below. Our operations have historically generated positive cash flows to fulfill our working capital requirements and other uses of cash as discussed below.\nCapital Investments\nCapital investments are composed of our capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, as reflected in our statements of cash flows as shown on page \n6\n. Capital investments exclude acquisitions, if any.\nWe have publicly announced GHG emissions reduction/displacement targets and a long-term ambition. We believe that our allocation of growth capital into low-carbon projects to date has been consistent with such targets and ambition. Certain low-carbon projects have been completed or are already in execution and the associated capital investments are included in our expected capital investments for 2025. Our capital investments in future years to achieve these targets and ambition are expected to include investments associated with certain low-carbon projects currently at various stages of progress, evaluation, or approval. For additional information, see the “RISK FACTORS” section included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nCapital Investments Attributable to Valero\nCapital investments attributable to Valero is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, excluding the portion of DGD’s capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of other consolidated VIEs.\nWe are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and consolidate its financial statements, and DGD’s operations compose our Renewable Diesel segment. As a result, all of DGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities. In general, DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments. We also exclude all of the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we consolidate because we do not operate \n63\nTable of Contents\nthose VIEs. See Note 6 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the VIEs that we consolidate. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.\nCapital investments attributable to Valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments, which is the most comparable GAAP measure, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently, which may diminish its utility.\nThe following table (in millions) reconciles our capital investments to capital investments attributable to Valero for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\nReconciliation of capital investments \nto capital investments attributable to Valero\nCapital expenditures (excluding VIEs)\n$\n504 \n$\n399 \nCapital expenditures of VIEs:\nDGD\n67 \n198 \nOther VIEs\n5 \n7 \nDeferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures\n(excluding VIEs)\n808 \n844 \nDeferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures\nof DGD\n91 \n62 \nInvestments in nonconsolidated joint ventures\n1 \n— \nCapital investments\n1,476 \n1,510 \nAdjustments:\nDGD’s capital investments attributable to the other joint\nventure member\n(79)\n(130)\nCapital expenditures of other VIEs\n(5)\n(7)\nCapital investments attributable to Valero\n$\n1,392 \n$\n1,373 \nWe have developed an extensive multi-year capital investment program, which we update and revise based on changing internal and external factors. We expect to incur approximately $1.9 billion for capital investments attributable to Valero during 2025. Of this amount, approximately $1.6 billion is for sustaining the business and the balance for growth strategies.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2025, our contractual obligations included debt obligations, interest payments related to debt obligations, operating lease liabilities, finance lease obligations, other long-term liabilities, and purchase obligations. In the ordinary course of business, we had debt-related activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n64\nTable of Contents\nOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nStock Purchase Programs\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we purchased for treasury 10,309,669 of our shares for a total cost of $1.5 billion. See Note 5 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our stock purchase programs. As of September 30, 2025, we had $311 million and $2.5 billion remaining available for purchase under the February 2024 and September 2024 Programs, respectively. We will continue to evaluate the timing of purchases when appropriate. We have no obligation to make purchases under these programs.\nPension Plan Funding\nWe contributed $88 million to our pension plans and $14 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nTax Matters\nOn July 4, 2025, the OBBB was enacted, which resulted in a broad range of changes to the Code, as more fully described in Note 8 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe do not expect that these changes and other provisions of this legislation will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity in 2025; however, we continue to evaluate the effects of the OBBB on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity in the future.\nCash Held by Our Foreign Subsidiaries\nAs of September 30, 2025, $4.0 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated to us through dividends without any U.S. federal income tax consequences, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions, U.S. state income taxes, and U.S. federal income tax on foreign exchange gains. Therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries to us.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nSee Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our asset retirement obligations.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by government authorities relating to, among other matters, the release or discharge of materials into the environment, climate, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG and other emissions, our facilities and operations, and characteristics and composition of many of our products. Because environmental laws and regulations have become more complex and stringent and new or revised environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future costs and expenditures required for environmental matters could increase.\nConcentration of Customers\nOur operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, including the uncertainties concerning worldwide events causing\n \nvolatility in the global crude oil markets. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts \n65\nTable of Contents\nreceivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024."
