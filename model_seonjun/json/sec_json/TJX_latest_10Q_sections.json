Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe Thirteen Weeks (third quarter) and Thirty-Nine Weeks (nine months) Ended November 1, 2025\nCompared to\nThe Thirteen Weeks (third quarter) and Thirty-Nine Weeks (nine months) Ended November 2, 2024\nOVERVIEW\nWe are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. Our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. We do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day through our stores \nand six e-commerce sites\n. We opera\nte nearly \n5,200 stores through our four segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates TJ Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods and Homesense); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates TK Maxx, Homesense, tkmaxx.com, tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at in Europe, and TK Maxx in Australia). In addition to our four segments, Sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs an overview of our financial performance, results for the quarter ended November 1, 2025 include the following:\n–\nNet sales increased 7% to $15.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 versus last year’s third quarter sales of $14.1 billion. As of November 1, 2025, the number of stores in operation increased approximately 3% and the selling square footage increased approximately 2% compared to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025. \n–\nConsolidated comp sales increased 5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2026. See Net Sales below for our definition of comp sales.\n–\nDiluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 were $1.28 versus $1.14 in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\n–\nPre-tax profit margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was 12.7%, a 0.4 percentage point increase compared with 12.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\n–\nOur cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was 67.4%, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared with 68.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\n–\nOur selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense ratio for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was 20.1%, a 0.6 percentage point increase compared with 19.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\n–\nOur consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce sites, were up 8% at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Sierra stores are included in the consolidated average per store inventories. \n–\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2026, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nRecent Events and Trends\nGlobal Economic Conditions and Tariffs\nWe continue to closely monitor changes in international trade relations, economic and monetary policies, and legislation and regulations including those related to tariffs on imports from China and other countries. While we have been, and believe we can continue to be, successful in mitigating tariff pressures, tariffs have led to significant volatility in the global economy. The extent and duration of the tariffs and the resulting impact on general economic conditions and on our business continues to be uncertain. Our buying organization’s ability to execute our merchandise sourcing model to offset the effects of the tariffs is a key factor. We are continuing to implement and consider additional measures that seek to mitigate the impact of tariffs. However, the overall impact depends on a range of factors, including trade negotiations between the U.S. and other countries, responses of other countries, exceptions that could be granted, and cost of alternative sources of merchandise. It is possible that some of the actions we might take to adapt could increase risk, drive a modification of our operations that might be time-consuming or expensive, or possibly impact pricing on certain items, which could impact our business. Uncertainty remains regarding the continued impact on our direct imports, indirect imports, vendor and competitor pricing, consumer demand, tariff pass-throughs, and reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs.\n25\nOperating Results as a Percentage of Net Sales\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales:\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNet sales\n100.0\n \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0\n \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs\n67.4\n \n68.4 \n69.0\n \n69.3 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n20.1\n \n19.5 \n19.7\n \n19.5 \nInterest (income) expense, net\n(0.2)\n(0.3)\n(0.2)\n(0.3)\nIncome before income taxes\n*\n12.7\n \n%\n12.3 \n%\n11.5\n \n%\n11.5 \n%\n*\nFigures may not foot due to rounding.\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the quarter ended November 1, 2025 totaled $15.1 billion, a 7% increase versus third quarter fiscal 2025 net sales of $14.1 billion. This increase reflects a 5% increase in comp sales, a 2% increase from non-comp sales and a neutral impact from foreign currency. Net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to approximately 2% of total sales for each of the third quarters of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2025.\nNet sales for the nine months ended November 1, 2025 totaled $42.6 billion, a 7% increase versus the first nine months of fiscal 2025 net sales of $40 billion. This increase reflects a 4% increase in comp sales, a 2% increase from non-comp sales and a 1% positive impact from foreign currency. Net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to approximately 2% of total sales for each of the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2025.\nComp sales increased 5% and 3% for the third quarters of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2025, respectively. Comp sales increased 4% and 3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2025, respectively. Both apparel comp sales growth (as defined below) and home comp sales growth (as defined below) performed in line with comp sales growth for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2026. Comp sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 were driven by a higher average basket and an increase in customer transactions. Comp sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 were primarily driven by an increase in customer transactions.\nAs of November 1, 2025, our store count increased approximately 3% and selling square footage increased approximately 2% compared to the end of the third quarter last year.\nDefinition of Comparable Sales\nWe define comparable sales, or comp sales, to be sales of stores and e-commerce sites that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or, in other words, stores or e-commerce sites that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. In any given fiscal year, we calculate comp sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp sales percentage is immaterial. Starting in fiscal 2026, sales from e-commerce sites are included in comp sales, and the impact of such sales on the consolidated comp sales percentage is immaterial. \nSales excluded from comp sales (“non-comp sales”) consist of sales from:\n–\nNew stores or e-commerce sites - stores or sites that have not yet met the comp sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp sales\n–\nStores or e-commerce sites that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time\nWe determine which stores and e-commerce sites are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year, and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store or e-commerce site is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year.\nComp sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis. We define constant currency basis as translating the current year’s results using the prior year’s exchange rates. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more appropriate measure of performance.\n26 \nComp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry; therefore, our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies. Comparable sales for a category such as home or apparel include sales from merchandise within such category combined across all divisions that fall within the Company’s definition of comparable sales for such period.\nWe define customer transactions to be the number of transactions in stores or online included in the comp sales calculation. We define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nOur operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies. We specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. This does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division's local currency, which is referred to as “transactional foreign exchange,” and also described below.\nTranslation Foreign Exchange\nIn our Consolidated Financial Statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in assets, liabilities, net sales, net income and earnings per share as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.\nMark-to-Market Inventory Derivatives\nWe routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected hedge accounting for these instruments, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.\nTransactional Foreign Exchange\nWhen discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange”. This primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. These two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends.\nCost of Sales, Including Buying and Occupancy Costs\nCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 67.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, a decrease of 1.0 percentage points compared to 68.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The decrease in the cost of sales ratio, including buying and occupancy costs, for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was attributable to favorable merchandise margin, lower supply chain costs as a result of a higher average ticket and expense leverage on higher comp sales. Merchandise margin reflects lower freight costs, favorable markon and lower shrink accrual rates in the current year.\nCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 69.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2026, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to 69.3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. The decrease in the cost of sales ratio, including buying and occupancy costs, for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 was due to favorable merchandise margin, which reflects lower shrink accrual rates in the current year.\n27 \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was 20.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 19.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The increase in the SG&A ratio for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was due to incremental store wage and payroll costs, a contribution to our U.S. charitable foundation and higher incentive compensation costs.\nSG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was 19.7% for the first nine months of fiscal 2026, an increase of 0.2 percentage points compared to 19.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. The increase in the SG&A ratio for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 was due to incremental store wage and payroll costs and contributions to our charitable foundations.\nInterest (Income) Expense, net \nThe components of interest (income) expense, net are summarized below:\n \nThirteen Weeks Ended\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nIn millions\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nInterest expense\n$\n20\n \n$\n20 \n$\n59\n \n$\n59 \nCapitalized interest\n(1)\n— \n(4)\n(0)\nInterest (income)\n(47)\n(63)\n(140)\n(198)\nInterest (income) expense, net\n$\n(28)\n$\n(43)\n$\n(85)\n$\n(139)\nInterest (income) expense, net decreased for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2026 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2025, primarily due to a decrease in interest income driven by a decrease in prevailing rates and a lower average cash balance.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, making permanent certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property and immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs, as well as modifying some of the international tax rules. These changes have not had a material impact for either the third quarter or the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s income tax provision. We expect these changes to reduce the Company’s current year U.S. cash tax obligations.\nA number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 15% global minimum tax regime (Pillar Two) with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations or financial position for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and are not expected to have a significant impact to the full fiscal year. We continue to evaluate the impacts of proposed and enacted legislation for the jurisdictions in which TJX operates.\nThe e\nffective income tax rate was 24.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and 25.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. \nThe e\nffective income tax rate was 24.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and 24.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. The decrease in the effective tax rate for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2026 was primarily due to the increase in an excess tax benefit from share-based compensation and a benefit from the acquisition of federal tax credits, partially offset by incremental taxes related to international operations.\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share\nNet income was $1.4 billion, or $1.28 per diluted share, and $1.3 billion, or $1.14 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2025, respectively. Foreign currency had a $0.01 positive impact on diluted earnings per share for both the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNet income was $3.7 billion, or $3.30 per diluted share, and $3.5 billion, or $3.03 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2025, respectively. Foreign currency had a $0.01 positive impact on diluted earnings per share for both the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and the first nine months of fiscal 2025.\n28\nSegment Information\nWe operate four segments. In the United States, our Marmaxx segment operates TJ Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com and our HomeGoods segment operates HomeGoods and Homesense. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates TK Maxx, Homesense, tkmaxx.com\n, tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at\n in Europe and TK Maxx in Australia. In addition to our four segments, Sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment. \nWe evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest (income) expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities, as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.\nPresented below is selected financial information related to our segments.\n29\nU.S. SEGMENTS\nMarmaxx\n \nThirteen Weeks Ended\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nU.S. dollars in millions\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n9,037\n \n$\n8,438 \n$\n25,930\n \n$\n24,633 \nSegment profit\n$\n1,350\n \n$\n1,207 \n$\n3,711\n \n$\n3,495 \nSegment profit margin \n14.9\n \n%\n14.3 \n%\n14.3\n \n%\n14.2 \n%\nComp sales\n6\n \n%\n2 \n%\n4\n \n%\n3 \n%\nStores in operation at end of period:\nTJ Maxx\n1,346\n \n1,331 \nMarshalls\n1,248\n \n1,219 \nSierra \n141\n \n109 \nTotal\n2,735\n \n2,659 \nSelling square footage at end of period (in millions):\nTJ Maxx\n30\n \n30 \nMarshalls\n27\n \n27 \nSierra \n2\n \n1 \nTotal\n59\n \n58 \nNet Sales\nNet sales for Marmaxx were $9 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, an increase of 7% compared to $8.4 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. This increase in the third quarter reflects a 6% increase from comp sales and a 1% increase from non-comp sales.\nNet sales for Marmaxx were $25.9 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2026, an increase of 5% compared to $24.6 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. This increase in the first nine months reflects a 4% increase from comp sales and a 1% increase from non-comp sales.\nFor both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2026, the increase in comp sales was driven by a higher average basket and an increase in customer transactions. While both Marmaxx apparel and home comp sales growth were positive, apparel comp sales growth outperformed home comp sales growth for the third quarter of fiscal 2026. Both Marmaxx apparel and home comp sales growth performed in line with the overall comp sales increase for the first nine months of fiscal 2026. Geographically, comp sales growth was strongest in the South and Midwest regions for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and in the South region for the first nine months of fiscal 2026.\nSegment Profit Margin\nSegment profit margin increased to 14.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to 14.3% for the same period last year. The increase in segment profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was primarily driven by favorable merchandise margin and expense leverage on higher comp sales, partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs.

Merchandise margin reflects lower shrink accrual rates in the current year.\nOur Marmaxx e-commerce sites, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com, together with sierra.com, represented approximately 2% of Marmaxx’s net sales for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2025, and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.\n30\nHomeGoods\n \nThirteen Weeks Ended\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nU.S. dollars in millions\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n2,539\n \n$\n2,355 \n$\n7,079\n \n$\n6,535 \nSegment profit\n$\n344\n \n$\n290 \n$\n802\n \n$\n679 \nSegment profit margin\n13.5\n \n%\n12.3 \n%\n11.3\n \n%\n10.4 \n%\nComp sales\n5\n \n%\n3 \n%\n5\n \n%\n3 \n%\nStores in operation at end of period:\nHomeGoods\n958\n \n941 \nHomesense\n77\n \n67 \nTotal\n1,035\n \n1,008 \nSelling square footage at end of period (in millions):\nHomeGoods\n18\n \n17 \nHomesense\n2\n \n2 \nTotal\n20\n \n19 \nNet Sales\nNet sales for HomeGoods were $2.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, an increase of 8%, compared to $2.4 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. This increase in the third quarter reflects a 5% increase from comp sales and a 3% increase from non-comp sales.\nNet sales for HomeGoods were $7.1 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2026, an increase of 8%, compared to $6.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. This increase in the first nine months reflects a 5% increase from comp sales and a 3% increase from non-comp sales.\nThe increase in comp sales was driven by a higher average basket for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and by an increase in customer transactions and a higher average basket for the first nine months of fiscal 2026. Geographically, comp sales growth was strongest in the South and Midwest regions for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and in the South and West regions for the first nine months of fiscal 2026.\nSegment Profit Margin\nSegment profit margin increased to 13.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to 12.3% for the same period last year. This increase in segment profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was driven by favorable merchandise margin and lower supply chain and store costs as a result of a higher average ticket. Merchandise margin reflects lower freight costs and favorable markon partially offset by higher markdowns.\nSegment profit margin increased to 11.3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 compared to 10.4% for the same period last year.

This increase in the third quarter reflects a 8% increase in comp sales, a 2% increase in non-comp sales, partially offset by a negative foreign currency impact of 2%.\nNet sales for TJX Canada were $4 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2026, an increase of 7%, compared to $3.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. This increase in the first nine months reflects a 7% increase in comp sales, a 3% increase in non-comp sales, partially offset by a negative foreign currency impact of 3%.\nThe increase in comp sales for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2026 was driven by an increase in customer transactions.\nSegment Profit Margin\nSegment profit margin decreased to 14.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to 15.1% for the same period last year. This decrease for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was primarily driven by capitalized inventory costs, higher incentive compensation costs and incremental store wage and payroll costs. These costs were partially offset by expense leverage on higher comp sales and higher merchandise margin. Within merchandise margin, lower markon, driven by the negative impact of transactional foreign exchange on the cost of merchandise, was more than offset by lower freight costs.\nSegment profit margin decreased to 14.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 compared to 14.3% for the same period last year. This decrease for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, capitalized inventory costs and incremental store wage and payroll costs. Merchandise margin reflects lower markon which includes the negative impact of transactional foreign exchange on the cost of merchandise partially offset by lower freight costs. These costs were partially offset by expense leverage on higher comp sales.\nFor both periods presented, capitalized inventory costs reflect a greater portion of our buying and distribution costs being expensed in the current year compared to the respective periods in the prior year.\n32\nTJX International\n \nThirteen Weeks Ended\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nU.S. dollars in millions\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNovember 1,\n2025\nNovember 2,\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n2,049\n \n$\n1,888 \n$\n5,603\n \n$\n5,103 \nSegment profit\n$\n188\n \n$\n137 \n$\n359\n \n$\n271 \nSegment profit margin\n9.2\n \n%\n7.3 \n%\n6.4\n \n%\n5.3 \n%\nComp sales\n3\n \n%\n7 \n%\n4\n \n%\n4 \n%\nStores in operation at end of period:\nTK Maxx\n672\n \n653 \nHomesense\n74\n \n77 \nTK Maxx Australia\n87\n \n84 \nTotal\n833\n \n814 \nSelling square footage at end of period (in millions):\nTK Maxx\n13\n \n13 \nHomesense\n1\n \n1 \nTK Maxx Australia\n1\n \n1 \nTotal\n15\n \n15 \nNet Sales\nNet sales for TJX International were $2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, an increase of 9%, compared to $1.9 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

General corporate expenses are primarily included in SG&A expenses. The mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel and inventory hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. \nThe increase in general corporate expense for both the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and first nine months of fiscal 2026 was primarily driven by higher other administrative costs, contributions to our charitable foundations and incentive compensation costs.\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of November 1, 2025, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, under which facilities we have $1.5 billion available as of the period ended November 1, 2025, are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future. Our 2.25% ten-year Notes due September 2026 will mature during our third quarter of fiscal 2027 and are included within our current maturities of long-term debt. For more information, see Note I—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of November 1, 2025, we held $4.6 billion in cash. Approximately $1.6 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $1 billion held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. We have provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through November 1, 2025. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid. \nWe monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may incur additional long-term indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions and other factors. Periodically, we have used, and in the future we may again use, operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors. As such, we may, from time to time, seek to retire, redeem, prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancings and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities resulted in net cash inflows of $3.7 billion for the nine months ended November 1, 2025 and $3.4 billion for the nine months ended November 2, 2024. \nOperating cash flows increased $305 million compared to fiscal 2025 primarily due to an increase in net income, timing of income taxes payable and an increase in accrued expenses reflecting higher incentive compensation costs. This was partially offset by an increase in merchandise inventories. \nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1.5 billion for the nine months ended November 1, 2025 and $1.6 billion for the nine months ended November 2, 2024. The cash outflows for both periods were driven by capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures in the first nine months of fiscal 2026 primarily reflected store improvements and renovations, investments in our new stores, as well as investments in our distribution centers and offices, including information technology. We anticipate that capital spending for the full \nfiscal year 2026 will be approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion\n.\nWe plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds.\n34\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $3 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and $2.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. The cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments.\nEquity\nUnder our stock repurchase programs, we paid $1.7 billion to repurchase and retire 13.4 million shares of our stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and we paid $1.7 billion to repurchase and retire 15.4 million shares of our stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2025. \nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the Company completed stock repurchases representing all of the $1.1 billion that remained as of February 1, 2025 from the previously announced stock repurchase program. As of November 1, 2025, approximately $1.9 billion remained available under our existing stock repurchase programs. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2026. For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note D – Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends \nWe declared quarterly dividends on our common stock of $0.425 per share for each of the quarters in the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and $0.375 per share for each of the quarters in the first nine months of fiscal 2025. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $1.4 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2026 and $1.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2025.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThere have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates as discussed in TJX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025. \nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion of accounting standards, see Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in TJX’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025 and Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n35\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements”.
