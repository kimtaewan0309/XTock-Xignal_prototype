See Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and our consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in November 2000. Our principal executive office is located at 909 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, California 94086 and our telephone number at that location is (408) 235-7700. \nIndustry Background: The Trends Driving the Need for a Platform Approach\nModern networks are increasingly complex, spanning many edges as well as a mix of cloud and on-premises deployments. We were\n founded with the mission of providing a converged networking and security approach that empowers organizations to adopt new technologies without worrying about how it would impact their ability to manage and secure their environments. The escalating threat landscape has resulted in a significant increase in the demand for secure networking solutions. In fact, we believe the demand for secure networking will overtake the pure networking market by 2030. At the same time, businesses contend with an escalating threat landscape, a cybersecurity skills shortage, and siloed security tools that do not work well together. They need to consolidate point products to gain better visibility and faster threat response times.\nA platform approach\n–what we call the Fortinet Security Fabric–has emerged to address these challenges and support enterprises in reducing complexity and improving risk mitigation. The concept of an integrated cybersecurity platform that converges networking and security and consolidates point products is what guides how we design our products and advise our customers and partners\n.\nAs organizations continue to modernize their cybersecurity infrastructure, we anticipate a significant firewall refresh and upgrade cycle in the coming years. Given our platform approach, this refresh presents a strategic opportunity to expand our footprint within existing customer environments. By leveraging our integrated security and networking capabilities, we can drive opportunities across our broader portfolio, including LAN, SD-WAN, SASE, Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (\n“\nCNAPP\n”\n) and SecOps solutions. With a unified management console, we enable consistent security policies, simplified operations, and an improved user experience across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. This approach strengthens security effectiveness and helps reduce complexity and total cost of ownership.\nCustomers\nOur end-customers are located in over 100 countries and include small, medium and large enterprises and government organizations across a wide range of industries, including financial services, government, manufacturing, retail, technology, education, healthcare and telecommunications. An end-customer deployment may involve as few as one or as many as dozens of different types of integrated products and services from across our broad portfolio that spans secure networking, unified SASE, and security operations. Depending on the solution or form factor purchased, customers may also access our products via the cloud through our data centers and PoPs, third-party colocations and cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Often, our customers also purchase our FortiGuard and other security subscription services and FortiCare technical support services. Refer to Note 16 Segment Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for distributor customers accounted for 10% or more of our revenue or net accounts receivable.\n5\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing\nWe primarily sell our products and services through a two-tier distribution model. We sell to distributors that sell to resellers and to service providers and managed security service providers (“MSSPs”), who, in turn, sell products and/or services to end-customers. In certain cases, we sell directly to large service providers, major systems integrators and large end users. We work with many technology distributors, including Arrow Electronics, Inc., Exclusive, Ingram Micro, and TD Synnex. In addition, we provide our cloud-based subscription offerings through Fortinet-owned data centers and PoPs, as well as data centers operated under colocation arrangements globally, and via public cloud providers.\nWe support our channel partners with a dedicated team of experienced channel account managers, sales professionals and sales engineers who provide business planning, joint marketing strategy, pre-sales and operational sales support. Additionally, our sales teams help drive and support large enterprise and service provider sales through a direct touch model. Our sales professionals and engineers typically work\n closely with our channel partners and directly engage with large end-customers to address their unique security and deployment requirements. To support our broadly dispersed global channel and end-customer base, we have sales professionals in over 100 countries around the world.\nOur marketing strategy is focused on building our \nbrand, driving thought leadership with emphasis on the criticality of cybersecurity platform adoption and the convergence of security and networking as well as driving end-customer demand for our security solutions. We use a combination of internal marketing professionals and our network of regional and global channel partners. Our internal marketing organization is responsible for messaging, branding, demand generation, product marketing, channel marketing, partner incentives and promotions, event marketing, digital marketing, communications, analyst relations, public relations, and sales enablement. We focus our resources on campaigns, programs, and activities that can be leveraged by partners worldwide to extend our marketing reach, such as sales tools and collateral, product awards and technical certifications, media engagement, training, regional seminars and conferences, webinars, and various other demand-generation activities.\nManufacturing and Suppliers\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers. Our current manufacturing partners include Accton Technology (“Accton”), IBASE Technology, Inc. (“IBASE”), Micro-Star International Co. (“Micro-Star”), Senao Networks, Inc. (“Senao”), Wistron Corporation (“Wistron”), and a number of other manufacturers. Approximately 88% of our hardware is manufactured in Taiwan. We submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured, the delivery date and other delivery terms. Once our products are manufactured, they are sent to either our warehouse in California or to our logistics partner in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, where accessory packaging and quality-control testing are performed. We believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to focus resources on our core competencies. Our proprietary ASICs, which are key to the performance of our appliances, are built by contract manufacturers including Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. (“Toshiba America”) and Renesas Electronics America, Inc. (“Renesas”). These contract manufacturers use foundries in Taiwan and Japan operated by either Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”) or by the contract manufacturer itself.\nThe components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or, more frequently, by our contract manufacturers. Some of the components important to our business, including certain Central Processing Units (“CPUs”) from Intel Corporation (“Intel”) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (“AMD”), network and wireless chips from Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”), Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (“Marvell”), Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) and Intel and memory devices from Intel, Micron Technology (“Micron”), ADATA Technology Co., Ltd. (“ADATA”), Toshiba Corporation (“Toshiba”), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”), and Western Digital Technologies, Inc. (“Western Digital”), are available from limited or sole sources of supply.\nWe have no long-term contracts related to the manufacturing of our ASICs or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms.\nOur supply chain plays a critical role in providing safety for our customers and protection for our brand. Supply chain security management begins with the establishing control of a qualified supplier base, which provides qualified and trusted components for use in design, development, manufacturing and post-sale product support.\nOur Trusted Supplier Program (“TSP”) was developed in accordance with the requirements defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publications (“NIST SP”) 800-161 Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations and other directives as periodically established by the U.S. government for \n6\nTable of Contents\nsecuring the Information and Communication Technology Services supply chain, in response to increasing customer demand for transparency in the security of the hardware, firmware and software that is included in our products and to comply with U.S. government directives.\nWe conduct a thorough security assessment of our key TSP partners to ensure they satisfactorily comply with applicable controls established by NIST SP 800-161, and work side by side with them to remediate gaps and monitor their security posture.\nResearch and Development\nWe focus our research and development efforts on developing new hardware and software products and services, and adding new features to existing products, services and operating systems. Our development strategy is to identify features, products and systems for both software and hardware that are, or are expected to be, important to our end-customers. Our success in designing, developing, manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors, including identification of market demand for new products or new features, components selection, timely implementation of product design and development, product performance, quality, ease of use, costs of development, bill of materials, delivery models, effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing.\nFortinet Secure Product Development Life Cycle\nWe recognize that supply chain security is an increasingly important dimension of cybersecurity and enterprise risk management. We are committed to implementing a comprehensive approach to protecting the security and integrity of our products throughout the product design, development, manufacturing, delivery and support processes.\nWe manage a coordinated program across our engineering, manufacturing, technical services teams, together with our suppliers and channel partners, to ensure the security of our supply chain.\n•\nWe develop our own Network Processors, Content Processors and System-on-Chip Application-Specific Integrated Circuits technology in house.\n•\nOur research and development is conducted primarily in the United States and Canada. We do not perform source code development or internal research and development in Russia or China.\n•\nWe operate a Trusted Supplier Program with a rigorous selection and qualification of manufacturing partners, adhering to National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) 800-161.\n•\nWe implement technical measures to prevent malware and rogue components that could compromise functionality.\n•\nWe provide technical support from dedicated Fortinet regional centers.\n•\nWe leverage application of secure development best practices (including NIST 800-53, NIST 800-160, NIST 800-218, US Executive Order 14028, and UK Telecoms Security Act).\n•\nWe conduct regular patch release cycles and operate a notification service to support and encourage customers to apply security patches.\nWe pursue and maintain a broad portfolio of product and information security certifications available at the Fortinet Trust Site.\nIntellectual Property \nWe rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. We periodically have discussions with third parties regarding licensing our intellectual property (“IP”) and have sometimes taken legal action against competitors to protect our IP, and as a result third parties have paid us fees in return for licenses or covenants-not-to-sue related to Fortinet IP. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,034 U.S. and 1,378 global patents and 451 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products, including open source software and other software.\nDespite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality \n7\nTable of Contents\nagreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other IP rights. Third parties have asserted, are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark or other IP rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. Even if third parties offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. In certain instances, we indemnify our end-customers, distributors and resellers against claims that our products infringe the IP of third parties.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal, state, regional, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, security and security certifications, product safety, product labeling, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, data privacy laws, import and export controls and tariffs, securities laws and tax laws and regulations. Many of the laws and regulations that are or may be applicable to our business are changing or being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could adversely impact our business and additional laws and regulations applicable to our business may be enacted. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the industry in which we operate. We believe we take reasonable steps designed to ensure we are in compliance with current laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently expect compliance to have a material adverse effect.\nSeasonality\nFor information regarding seasonality in our sales, see the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Revenue Trends” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompetition \nThe markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. The principal competitive factors in our markets include:\n \n•\nproduct security performance, throughput, features, effectiveness, interoperability and reliability;\n•\naddition and integration of new networking and security features and technological expertise;\n•\ncompliance with industry standards and security and other certifications;\n•\nprice of products and services and total cost of ownership;\n•\nbrand recognition;\n•\ncustomer service and support across varied and complex customer segments and use cases;\n•\nsales and distribution capabilities;\n•\nsize and financial stability;\n•\nbreadth of product line;\n8\nTable of Contents\n•\nform factor of the solution; and\n•\nother competitive differentiators.\nAmong others, our competitors include Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (“Check Point”), Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike”), F5 Networks, Inc. (“F5 Networks”), Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (“HPE”), Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”), Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper”), Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), Netskope Inc. (“Netskope”), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (“Palo Alto Networks”), SonicWALL, Inc. (“SonicWALL”), Sophos Group Plc (“Sophos”) and Zscaler, Inc. (“Zscaler”).\nWe believe we compete favorably based on our products’ security performance, throughput, reliability, breadth and ability to work together, our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise. Several competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition. Some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. Other, often smaller competitors, may intensely focus on a small group of point solutions and be positioned as a leader in discrete technologies that we compete with. Based in part on these competitive pressures, we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionalities to our products.\nConditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, market consolidation or de-consolidation, supply chain constraints,\n \nprice list or discount changes or inflation. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete. Our competitors may introduce products that are less costly, provide superior performance, are better marketed, or achieve greater market acceptance than our products. Additionally, our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are better positioned to withstand a significant reduction in capital spending by end-customers, and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. The above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competition may harm our business.\nHuman Capital Management \nAs of December 31, 2024, our total headcount was 14,138 employees, approximately 30% of whom were employed in the United States, approximately 20% of whom were employed in Canada and approximately 50% of whom were employed outside of the United States and Canada. We do not own any manufacturing or research and development activities in China.\nOur employees are the foundation of our innovation and cybersecurity leadership for the benefit of our customers. We understand there is a shortage of highly skilled employees for security companies like ours, and we believe that our success and competitive advantage depends largely on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits, and we encourage a culture of fairness and meritocracy. Our compensation programs for our employees include base pay, incentive compensation, opportunities for equity ownership where local statutes allow and employee benefits that promote well-being across different aspects of our employees’ lives, which may include health and welfare insurance, retirement benefits and paid time off.\nAs a global company, we value diversity and inclusion across our workforce. Such commitment \nstarts at the top, with a highly skilled and diverse board of directors. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, women \nrepresented 40% of the members of our board of directors, and approximately 50% o\nf our board of directors was from underrepresented communities. \nWe are also \ncommitted to community engagement and social responsibility with regards to our employees and beyond, and our board of directors has active oversight of such initiatives. Examples of our initiatives focused on our employees include our company matching program for employee charitable contributions and the free security training programs we offer to help with career development for our employees, in addition to the general public.\nOur culture is defined by our commitment to ethics and integrity. We reinforce our ethical “tone at the top” through clear policies including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, regular compliance training for our employees, quarterly meetings of our cross-functional Ethics Committee, clear messaging from our executives, enforcement of company policies and oversight by our board of directors. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer regularly communicates the importance of our core values of openness, teamwork and innovation. \n9\nTable of Contents\nNone of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Our employees in certain European and Latin American countries, however, have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain up-to-date union membership. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nCorporate Sustainability\nWe are committed to responsible corporate sustainability practices and having a positive impact on the sustainability of our society and planet. We are a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices — World and North America, for the second consecutive year. Our approach to corporate sustainability is based on a strong corporate governance structure, starting with the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee (the “GSR Committee”) of our board of directors, which provides oversight of our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) strategy, initiatives and execution related to corporate sustainability matters. Our senior leadership sponsors the integration of CSR priorities via a CSR Committee, comprised of cross-functional team of senior leaders that drives CSR initiatives and functionality across the company including engaging with internal and external stakeholders to lead CSR execution, communications and disclosure via an annual Sustainability Report.\nWe recognize that environmental considerations such as climate change, resource scarcity and the energy crisis are top priorities for the future of our planet. We are committed to helping address climate change impacts and minimizing the environmental footprint of our solutions, operations and our broader value chain. We have completed our validation process and have been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiatives for a near-term target. We are engaged on a decarbonization path to reach zero emissions for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030. In 2023, we obtained the ISO14001 certification for our largest company-owned warehouse in Union City, California, and have continued to be a leader on energy efficiency with the launch of our SP5 ASIC and our FortiGate-90G model. We submitted our survey on environment to CDP, which is a not-for-profit charity organization that runs the global disclosure system for companies to manage their environmental impacts. We also disclosed for the first time our Scope 3 emissions, across all 12 relevant categories, as part of our annual reporting on sustainability. \nWe are committed to empower individuals within our organization and across the security industry to reach their full potential. We continue to focus on skilling, upskilling and reskilling individuals and are on track to reach our goal of training one million people in cybersecurity by 2026 with over 630,000 individuals trained as of the end of 2024. As part of our Education Outreach Program, which focuses on creating a more diverse cybersecurity talent pool, we launched the Veterans Program Advisory Council to help build on the Veterans Program’s success in providing more cybersecurity training pathways for military veterans across the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We offered our Security Awareness Curriculum at no cost to primary and secondary schools across the same countries. We are involved in over 700 education partnerships across more than 100 countries and participates in public-private partnerships, including the World Economic Forum’s Cybersecurity Talent Framework.\nOur approach to responsible business is based on strong corporate governance practices that aim to ensure accountability while meeting our responsibilities across our value chain, starting with our employees. Our board of directors regularly reviews our governance practices and in 2024 we formed our GSR committee which combined our Governance Committee with the Social Responsibility Committee to GSR Committee. Our Codes of Conduct apply to employees, partners and suppliers, and we have compliance trainings and controls in place. In 2023, we established a risk management committee and steering committee to further enhance our anti-corruption program and we employ a thorough screening process for partners and suppliers, including continuous monitoring in high-risk zones, and resolution process for risk mitigation. \nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at https://www.fortinet.com, and our investor relations website is located at https://investor.fortinet.com.

Short-term deferred revenue was $3.28 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $427.5 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2023. \n•\nCash flows from operating activities were $2.26 billion in 2024, an increase of $322.6 million, or 17%, compared to 2023.\n•\nOn August 1, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Lacework, a privately held data-driven cloud security company. On August 5, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Next DLP, a privately held insider risk and DLP company. From August 2024 to December 2024, revenue from these two acquired companies was $33.5 million, or 0.6% of total revenue in 2024.\nOn a geographic basis, revenue continues to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. In 2024, the Americas region, the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region and the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) region contributed 41%, 40% and 19% of our total revenue, respectively, and increased 12%, 16% and 6% compared to 2023, respectively. \nProduct revenue remained comparatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023\n. \nWe expect product revenue growth rates to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024 which had a challenging comparison to a 2023 year benefiting from the greater backlog contribution to billings. \nService revenue grew 20% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the strength of our security subscription revenue, which grew 22% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of service revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance related to FortiGuard and other security subscriptions delivered to on-premise and cloud-based environments and strength in unified SASE and SecOps. We expect our service revenue to continue to grow in 2025, with growth opportunities that include unified SASE and SecOps offerings as well as the year over year increase in current deferred revenue. While service revenue is expected to grow in 2025, we anticipate that the growth rates will continue to \nslow down in 2025 due to slowing short term deferred revenue growth over the \npast several quarters. \nOur billings were diversified on a geographic basis. In 2024, seven countries represented approximately 50% of our billings and the remaining approximately 50% were from over\n 100 countries that each individually contributed less than 3% \nof our billings. \nTotal gross margin increased \n3.9\n percentage points in \n2024\n compared to \n2023\n, primarily driven by increased product and service gross margin and a shift in the revenue mix to higher margin service revenue. O\nur overall gross margin in 2025 will be impacted by service and product revenue mix and their respective gross margins. We expect our service \ngross margin to decrease for full year 2025 compared to full year 2024, \nas we expand our data center footprint and colocation and cloud hosting capacity to support the growth in our unified SASE and SecOps offerings.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased approximately 3.0 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly because our revenue growth outpaced personnel costs. Headcount increased 4% to 14,138 employees as of December 31, 2024, up from 13,568 as of December 31, 2023. \nWe expect our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase for full year 2025 compared to full year 2024 as we expand our workforce organically and through acquisitions.\nOperating margin increased \n6.9\n percentage points in \n2024\n as a result of improvement in gross margin and decrease in operating exp\nenses as a percentage of revenue. We expect our operating margin to decrease for full year 2025 compared to full year 2024 as we grow our sales and marketing, and research and development workforce \norganically and through acquisitions\n, increase our product development investments, and expand our data center footprint and our colocation and cloud hosting capacity to support business growth.\nImpact of Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Developments\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, such as GDP growth, the war in Ukraine or tensions between China and Taiwan, and their impact on customer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, changing interest rates, tariffs and other trade disruptions, slower growth, any recession, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other changes in economic conditions, may result in decreased sales productivity and \n57\nTable of Contents\ngrowth and adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance. We have seen certain impacts on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and capital and financial resources such as longer sales cycles, delayed purchases and increased commitments with certain suppliers and increased inventory and inventory purchase commitment reserves. \nWorsening economic conditions may have a material negative impact on our results in future periods and may negatively impact our billings, revenue and costs, and may decrease growth and profitability. The extent of the impact of economic conditions on our operational and financial performance will depend on ongoing developments, including those discussed above and others identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the full impact of worsening economic conditions on our business and operations, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and capital and financial resources cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nBusiness Model \nWe typically sell our security solutions to distributors that sell to networking security focused resellers and to certain service providers and managed security service providers, who, in turn, sell to end-customers or use our products and services to provide hosted solutions to other enterprises. At times, we also sell directly to enterprise customers, service providers, systems integrators and large enterprises. We also sell our software licenses and cloud delivered services via different cloud service provider platforms, both directly and through our channel partners. Our end-customers are located in over 100 countries and include small, medium and large enterprises and government organizations across a wide range of industries, including financial services, government, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, technology and telecommunications. An end-customer deployment may involve as few as one or as many as thousands of secure networking, unified SASE and security operations technology products or users, depending on the end-customer’s size and security requirements. \nOur customers purchase our hardware products, software licenses and cloud-delivered solutions, including our FortiGuard and other security subscriptions, FortiCare technical support services, certain unified SASE and SecOps services. We generally invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and services. Standard payment terms are generally no more than 60 days, though we may offer extended payment terms to certain distributors or large enterprises.\nWe offer our products hosted in our own data centers, PoPs and through colocations and major cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. \nKey Metrics\nWe monitor several key metrics, including the key financial metrics set forth below, in order to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. The following table summarizes revenue, deferred revenue, billings (non-GAAP), net cash provided by operating activities, and free cash flow (non-GAAP). We discuss revenue below under “—Components of Operating Results,” and we discuss net cash provided by operating activities below under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Deferred revenue, billings (non-GAAP), and free cash flow (non-GAAP) are discussed immediately below the following table.\n \nYear Ended or As of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nRevenue\n$\n5,955.8 \n$\n5,304.8 \n$\n4,417.4 \nDeferred revenue\n$\n6,360.9 \n$\n5,735.0 \n$\n4,640.3 \nBillings (non-GAAP)\n$\n6,532.5 \n$\n6,399.5 \n$\n5,594.0 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,258.1 \n$\n1,935.5 \n$\n1,730.6 \nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\n$\n1,879.2 \n$\n1,731.4 \n$\n1,449.4 \nDeferred revenue.\n Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from FortiGuard and other security subscriptions and FortiCare technical support service contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the service term. We monitor our deferred revenue balance, short term and total deferred revenue growth and the mix of short-term and long-term deferred revenue because deferred revenue represents a significant portion of free cash flow and of revenue to be recognized in future periods. Deferred revenue was $6.36 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $625.9 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2023. Short term deferred revenue was $3.28 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $427.5 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2023.\n58\nTable of Contents\nBillings (non-GAAP). \nWe define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combination(s) during the period. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive current and future revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business and cash flows. There are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of GAAP revenue. First, billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the term of security and support agreements. Second, we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures. Management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding GAAP revenue and evaluating billings together with GAAP revenue. Total billings were $6.53 billion in 2024, an increase of 2% compared to $6.40 billion in 2023.\nOur backlog may fluctuate over quarters. A reduction to backlog increases our aggregate billings and revenue during the quarter when delivered. If we experience supply chain shortages and cannot fulfill orders or if customers cancel or delay delivery of orders, our backlog may be affected, which will negatively impact our aggregate backlog to billings conversion and revenue in such quarter, and as the supply chain challenges normalized, our product revenue growth rate may be lower versus prior quarters where delivery from backlog contributed more to billings.\nA reconciliation of revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to billings is provided below:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nBillings: \nRevenue \n$\n5,955.8 \n$\n5,304.8 \n$\n4,417.4 \nAdd: Change in deferred revenue \n625.9 \n1,094.7 \n1,187.4 \nLess: Deferred revenue balance acquired in business combinations\n(49.2)\n— \n(10.8)\nTotal billings (non-GAAP)\n$\n6,532.5 \n$\n6,399.5 \n$\n5,594.0 \nFree cash flow (non-GAAP).\n We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures, can be used for strategic opportunities, including repurchasing outstanding common stock, investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. A limitation of using free cash flow rather than the GAAP measures of cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance for the period because it excludes investing activities other than capital expenditures and cash flows from financing activities. Management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows and under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and by presenting cash flows from investing and financing activities in our reconciliation of free cash flow. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow is provided below:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nFree Cash Flow:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,258.1 \n$\n1,935.5 \n$\n1,730.6 \nLess: Purchases of property and equipment\n(378.9)\n(204.1)\n(281.2)\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\n$\n1,879.2 \n$\n1,731.4 \n$\n1,449.4 \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n$\n(727.4)\n$\n(649.3)\n$\n763.9 \nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(50.1)\n$\n(1,570.4)\n$\n(2,130.3)\n59\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Operating Results \nRevenue. \nWe generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware and software products and amortization of amounts included in deferred revenue related to previous sales of FortiGuard and other security subscriptions and FortiCare technical support services. We also recognize revenue from cloud security solutions, professional services, and training.\nOur total revenue is comprised of:\n•\nProduct revenue\n. Product revenue is primarily generated from sales of our physical and virtual machine appliances. The majority of our product revenue continues to be generated by our secure networking product lines. Product revenue also includes revenue from sales of unified SASE and SecOps software technologies. As a percentage of total revenue, our product revenue has varied from quarter to quarter.\n•\nService revenue\n. Service revenue is generated primarily from FortiGuard and other security subscription services and FortiCare technical support services. We recognize revenue from FortiGuard and other security subscriptions and FortiCare technical support services ratably over the service term. Our typical contractual support and subscription term is one to five years. We also generate our revenue from other services, for which we recognize revenue as the services are provided, and cloud-based services, for which we recognize revenue as the services are delivered or on a monthly usage basis. As a percentage of total revenue, we continue to expect service revenue to be higher than product revenue. Our service revenue growth rate depends significantly on the growth of our customer base, the expansion of our service bundle offerings, the mix of our product revenue, pricing actions, the expansion and introduction of new service offerings, the attach rate of service contracts to new product sales, and the renewal of service contracts by our existing customers.\nOur total cost of revenue is comprised of:\n•\nCost of product revenue\n. Cost of product revenue is primarily comprised of third-party contract manufacturers’ costs and the costs of materials used in production. Our cost of product revenue also includes supplies, shipping costs, personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control, facility-related costs, excess and obsolete inventory costs, charges related to excess inventory commitments and amortization of intangible assets. Personnel costs include compensation benefits and stock-based compensation.\n•\nCost of service revenue\n. Cost of service revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs, replacement cost, data center infrastructure, software and delivery costs, colocation and cloud provider fees, facility-related costs and amortization of intangible assets.\nGross margin\n. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products, product costs, the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between hardware products, software licenses and services and any excess inventory or other charges. Generally, service revenue and software licenses have higher gross margins compared to hardware products. Overall gross margin in 2025 will be impacted by service and product revenue mix and their respective gross margins.\nOperating expenses\n. Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, sales commissions and stock-based compensation. We expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our workforce. \n•\nResearch and development\n. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Additional research and development expenses include ASIC and system prototypes and certification-related expenses, depreciation of property and equipment and facility-related expenses. The majority of our research and development is focused on software and hardware development. We record research and development expenses as incurred. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 79%, 7%, 5%, 3% and 3% of our research and development teams were located in North America, India, Israel, Japan and Taiwan, respectively. We do not own research and development team located in China. As of December 31, 2024, approximately two-thirds of our engineers worked on software development while the remainder worked on hardware development.\n•\nSales and marketing\n. Sales and marketing expense is the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consists of personnel costs. Additional sales and marketing expenses include product marketing, public relations, field marketing and events and channel marketing programs (e.g., partner cooperative marketing arrangements), as well as travel, depreciation of property and equipment and facility-related \n60\nTable of Contents\nexpenses. We intend to hire additional personnel focused on sales and marketing and expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide in order to capture market share. \n•\nGeneral and administrative\n. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, as well as professional fees, depreciation of property and equipment and internal-use software and facility-related expenses. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. Our professional fees principally consist of outside legal, auditing, tax, information technology and other consulting costs.\nInterest income.\n Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and investments. Historically, our interest-bearing investments include corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit and term deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities and municipal bonds.\nInterest expense.\n Interest expense consists of interest expense due to the senior notes and other miscellaneous interest expense.\nOther income (expense)\n—\nnet\n. Other income (expense)—net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign currency remeasurement, gains or losses due to the changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities, realized gains and losses of available-for-sale investments, net rental income from real estate, as well as the gain on the sale or the impairment of investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, which are not accounted for under the equity method.\nProvision for income taxes.\n We are subject to income taxes in the United States, as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in local countries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than in the U.S., federal research and development tax credit, state income taxes, withholding taxes, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense and the tax impacts of the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction.\nLoss from equity method investments.\n Loss from equity method investments consists of our proportionate share of the investees’ net loss, the amortization of any basis differences, as well as any other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) when events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the investment may be impaired.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nWe believe that, of the significant accounting policies described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition \nRevenues are recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. \nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n•\nidentification of a contract or contracts with a customer;\n•\nidentification of the performance obligations in a contract, including evaluation of performance obligations as to being distinct goods or services in a contract;\n•\ndetermination of a transaction price;\n61\nTable of Contents\n•\nallocation of a transaction price to the performance obligations in a contract; and\n•\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nOur sales contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, such as hardware, software license, security subscription, technical support services, cloud and other services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Our hardware and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities. Accordingly, the hardware and software licenses are distinct from the security subscription and technical support services, as a customer can benefit from the product without the services and the services are separately identifiable within a contract. We allocate a transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. We establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If not observable through past transactions, we determine standalone selling price by considering multiple historical factors including, but not limited to, cost of products, gross margin objectives, pricing practices, geographies and the term of a service contract. \nDeferred Contract Costs and Commission Expense\nWe defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts. Contract costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Costs for initial contracts that are not commensurate with commissions on renewal contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit of five years. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for deferred contract costs include, but are not limited to, identification of contract costs, anticipated billings and the expected period of benefit. \nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The excess of the fair values of the net assets acquired over the net purchase consideration is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase within other income, net on the consolidated statements of income. We often continue to gather additional information throughout the measurement period, and if we make changes to the amounts recorded, such changes are recorded in the period in which they are identified.\nContingent Liabilities\nFrom time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. We periodically review significant claims and litigation matters for the probability of an adverse outcome. We accrue for a loss contingency if a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are generally based on a range of possible outcomes that require significant judgement. Estimates can change as individual claims develop. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.\nAccounting for Income Taxes \nWe record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets \n62\nTable of Contents\nrepresent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of income become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would be recorded in the consolidated statements of income for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required. \nWe recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \nWe have elected to account for the tax effect of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a current period expense.\n63\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods.

Revenue from all regions grew, with EMEA contributing the largest portion of the increase on an absolute dollar basis and on a percentage basis.\nProduct revenue remained comparatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023\n.\nService revenue increased $669.6 million, or 20%, in 2024 compared to 2023. Security subscription revenue\n increased $418.6 million, or 22%, and technical support and other services revenue increased $251.0 million, or 17%, in 2024 \ncompared to 2023\n. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance related to FortiGuard and other security subscriptions delivered to on-premise and cloud-based environments and growth in SaaS solutions, including unified SASE and SecOps.\nOf the service revenue recognized in 2024, 70% was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023. Of the service revenue recognized in 2023, 67% was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022.\nOf the service revenue recognized in each quarter of 2024, from 88% to 90% was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the respective quarter. We expect service revenue growth rates to continue to slow down in 2025 due to slowing short term deferred revenue growth over the past several quarters\n, \npartially offset by increases in SaaS revenue.\n66\nTable of Contents\nCost of revenue and gross margin\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n \n \n2024\n2023\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nCost of revenue:\nProduct\n$\n652.0 \n$\n763.6 \n$\n(111.6)\n(15)\n%\nService\n505.6 \n473.6 \n32.0 \n7 \nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n1,157.6 \n$\n1,237.2 \n$\n(79.6)\n(6)\n%\nGross margin (%):\nProduct\n65.8 \n%\n60.4 \n%\nService\n87.5 \n%\n86.0 \n%\nTotal gross margin\n80.6 \n%\n76.7 \n%\nPercentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.\nTotal gross margin increased 3.9 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by a shift in the revenue mix to higher margin service revenue and increased product and service gross margin. Revenue mix shifted by 4.3 percentage points from product revenue to service revenue, as a percentage of total revenue. \nProduct gross margin increased 5.4 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to decrease in inventory related reserves expense, lower expedite fees, a shift in revenue mix from hardware to software and lower freight costs, partially offset by reduced prices on certain products. During the first quarter of 2024, we lowered list prices on select products. Cost of product revenue was comprised primarily of third-party contract manufacturers’ costs, costs of materials used in production and inventory reserves related to excess inventory and contractual delivery commitments.\nService gross margin increased 1.5 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by service revenue growth outpacing labor and replacement costs increase, partially offset by an increase in cloud service costs.

In the first quarter, we generally experience lower sequential customer product buying, followed by an increase in buying in the second and third quarters. Although these seasonal factors may be common in the technology sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. On a quarterly basis, we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter. We believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry.\nOur quarterly revenue over the past three years has increased sequentially each quarter within the year. \nTotal gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to the relative product and service mix. Product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold, their cost profile and their average selling prices.

Additional increases in billings may depend on a number of factors, including demand for and availability of our products and services, competition, pricing actions, market or industry changes, macroeconomic events such as rising inflation and changing interest rates, economic strength, supply chain capacity and disruptions, tariffs and other trade restrictions, international conflicts, including the war in Ukraine, an increase in installment billing, and our ability to execute. We expect proceeds from the exercise of stock options in future years to continue to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units and performance stock units versus stock options granted to our employees and to vary based on our share price.\nIn January 2024, our board of directors approved a $500.0 million increase in the authorized stock repurchase amount under the Repurchase Program, bringing the aggregate amount authorized to be repurchased to $7.25 billion of our outstanding common stock. In February 2024, our board of directors approved an extension of the Repurchase Program to February 28, 2025. In October 2024, our board of directors approved a $1.0 billion increase in the authorized stock repurchase amount under the Repurchase Program and extended the term of the Repurchase Program to February 28, 2026, bringing the aggregate amount authorized to be repurchased to $8.25 billion of our outstanding common stock through February 28, 2026. In 2024, we repurchased less than 0.1 million shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program for an aggregate purchase price of $0.6 million. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $2.03 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the Repurchase Program. \nWe expect to continue to increase our data centers, PoPs, office and warehouse capacity to support growth and the expansion of existing services or introduction of new services. As we purchase new properties, we will work to incorporate these properties into the environmental goals we have established. We estimate 2025 capital expenditures to be between approximately $380.0 million and $430.0 million. \nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our senior notes, inventory purchase and other contractual commitments. As of December 31, 2024, the long-term debt, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, was $994.3 million. $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes is due on March 15, 2026 and $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes is due on March 15, 2031. In addition, we purchase components of our inventory from certain suppliers and use several independent contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancelable and unconditional commitments. Certain of these inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. \nThese inventory purchase commitments as of December 31, 2024 totaled $591.1 million, a decrease of $46.2 million compared to $637.3 million as of December 31, 2023 due to fulfillment of customer demand as our supply availability improved and our continued efforts to work with contract manufacturers and suppliers to optimize our inventory and purchase commitments position. We record a liability for inventory purchase commitments in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. We estimate payments of $588.9 million due on or before December 31, 2025 related to these commitments. \nWe increased our purchase commitments in prior years to address significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages and have reduced the purchase commitments in 2024. Our agreements secured supply and pricing for certain product components with contract manufacturers to meet customer demand and to address extended lead times. \nInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints, rapidly changing technology, and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels.\nWe also have open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services. As of December 31, 2024, we had $101.2 million in other contractual commitments having a remaining term in excess of one year that are non-cancelable.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments of $4.07 billion were invested primarily in deposit accounts, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency securities, certificates of deposit and term deposits and money market funds. It is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital, provides liquidity, and generates return without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe amount of cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our international subsidiaries was \n$207.8 million\n and $199.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet our requirements and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements. In the long term, our ability to support our requirements and plans for cash, including our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate; the timing and amount of our share repurchases and debt retirement; the expansion of sales and marketing activities, pricing actions, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings; the continuing market acceptance of our products; the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts; our investments in purchasing, developing or leasing real estate; cash paid for taxes and macroeconomic impacts such as rising inflation and changing interest rates; and the war in Ukraine. Historically, we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisition activities. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nOperating Activities\nCash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity. It is primarily comprised of net income, as adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments consist primarily of amortization of deferred contract costs, stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization. Changes in operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of changes in deferred revenue, deferred contract costs, accrued liabilities, deferred tax assets, inventory and accounts receivable—net.\nOur operating activities during 2024 provided cash flows of $2.26 billion as a result of the continued growth of our business, improved profitability and our ability to successfully manage our working capital. Changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our security subscription services and technical support services to new and existing customers, as reflected by an increase of $577.8 million in our deferred revenue during 2024. In addition, changes in operating assets and liabilities were driven by an increase of $311.1 million in deferred contract costs, an increase of $223.2 million in deferred tax assets, a decrease of $131.2 million in inventory, a decrease of $106.7 million in accrued liabilities, and an increase of $45.4 million in accounts receivable—net.\nInvesting Activities \nThe changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, maturities and sales of investments, purchases of property and equipment, investments in various companies and business acquisitions. Historically, in making a lease-versus-ownership decision related to warehouse, office or data center space, we have considered various factors including financial metrics, expected long-term growth rates, time to market, operating costs and changes in asset values. In certain cases, we have elected to own a facility if we believe that purchasing or developing buildings rather than leasing is more closely aligned with our long-term strategy. We expect to make similar decisions in the future. We may also make cash payments in connection with future business combinations.\nDuring 2024, cash used in investing activities was $727.4 million, primarily driven by $378.9 million used for the purchases of property and equipment, $275.5 million used for the acquisitions of Lacework, \nNext DLP and Perception Point\n, net of cash and $56.4 million spent for purchases of investments, net of maturities and sales of investments.\nFinancing Activities \nThe changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to repurchase and retirement of common stock, and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2009 EIP”).\nDuring 2024, cash used in financing activities was $50.1 million, primarily driven by $37.8 million used to pay tax withholding, net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock. \n71\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.",
