We seek to deliver compelling returns for institutional and individual investors by strengthening the companies and assets in which we invest. Our more than $1.1 trillion in Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2024 include global investment strategies focused on real estate, private equity, infrastructure, life sciences, growth equity, credit, real assets, secondaries and hedge funds. \nOur businesses use a solutions-oriented approach to drive better performance. We believe our scale, diversified business, long record of investment performance, rigorous investment process and strong client relationships position us to continue to perform well in a variety of market conditions, expand our assets under management, and innovate. \nWe invest across asset classes on behalf of our investors, including pension funds, insurance companies and individual investors. Our mission is to fulfill our fiduciary duty by creating long-term value for our investors. We aim to do this by strengthening the companies, real estate assets and other investments in our portfolio, equipping them to thrive in the global economy.

Our employees are integral to Blackstone’s culture of integrity, professionalism and excellence. We believe hiring, training and retaining talented individuals, coupled with our rigorous investment process, has supported our excellent investment record over many years. This record, in turn, has enabled us to innovate into new strategies, drive growth and better serve our investors. \nBusiness Segments \nOur four business segments are: (a) Real Estate, (b) Private Equity, (c) Credit & Insurance and (d) Multi-Asset Investing.

BXCI offers its clients and borrowers a comprehensive solution across corporate and asset based credit, including investment grade and \nnon-investment\n grade. BXCI is one of the largest credit managers and CLO managers in the world. The investment portfolios BXCI’s credit platform manages or \nsub-advises\n consist primarily of loans and securities of \nnon-investment\n and investment grade companies spread across the capital structure including senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred stock and common equity. \nBXCI is organized into three overarching credit investing strategies: private corporate credit, liquid corporate credit and infrastructure and asset based credit. The private corporate credit strategies include mezzanine and direct lending funds, private placement strategies, stressed/distressed strategies and SMAs. The direct lending funds include Blackstone Private Credit Fund (“BCRED”) and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (“BXSL”), both of which are business development companies (“BDCs”). The liquid corporate credit strategies consist of CLOs, closed-ended funds, open-ended funds, systematic strategies and SMAs. The infrastructure and asset based credit strategies include energy strategies (including our sustainable resources platform) and asset based finance strategies focused on privately originated, income-oriented credit assets secured by physical, financial or residential real estate collateral. \n \n9 \nTable of Contents\nOur insurance platform focuses on providing full investment management services for insurance and reinsurance accounts, seeking to deliver customized and diversified portfolios consisting primarily of investment grade credit, including through Blackstone’s private credit origination capabilities. Through this platform, we provide our clients tailored portfolio construction, strategic asset allocation, and specialized analytical tools. While focusing on policyholder protection, we seek to achieve risk-managed, liability-matched and capital-efficient returns, as well as diversification and capital preservation. We also provide similar services to clients through SMAs or by \nsub-managing\n assets for certain insurance-dedicated funds and special purpose vehicles. \nMulti-Asset Investing \nOur Multi-Asset Investing segment (“BXMA”) has approximately 240 employees managing $84.2 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2024. BXMA, the world’s largest discretionary allocator to hedge funds, seeks to grow investors’ assets through investment strategies designed to deliver, primarily through the public markets, compelling risk-adjusted returns. \nBXMA is organized into two primary platforms: Absolute Return and Multi-Strategy. Absolute Return is designed to pursue consistent, efficient and diversifying returns across multiple market environments. Absolute Return manages a broad range of commingled and customized fund solutions, a seeding business and registered funds that provide alternative asset solutions through daily liquidity products. Multi-Strategy aims to generate strong risk-adjusted returns through opportunistic, asset-class agnostic investing, including structured risk transfer and equity capital markets strategies. \nBXMA also includes a platform managed by Harvest Fund Advisors LLC (“Harvest”), which primarily invests in publicly traded energy infrastructure, renewables and master limited partnerships holding midstream energy assets in North America. \nPerpetual Capital \nEach of our business segments currently includes Perpetual Capital assets under management, which refers to assets under management with an indefinite term, that are not in liquidation and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows or where required redemptions are limited in quantum. In recent years, we have continued to meaningfully increase our assets under management in such vehicles. Perpetual Capital strategies represent a significant and growing portion of our overall business, and the management fees and performance revenues we receive. Perpetual Capital strategies include, without limitation, (a) in our Real Estate segment, Core+ real estate (including BREIT and BEPIF) and BXMT, (b) in our Private Equity segment, BIP, BXPE, BXINFRA and vehicles in GP Stakes, and (c) in our Credit & Insurance segment, BXSL and BCRED. In addition, assets managed for certain of our insurance clients are Perpetual Capital assets under management. \nPrivate Wealth Strategy \nBlackstone’s business historically focused on the provision of investment products, such as traditional drawdown funds, to institutional investors. Blackstone’s business now also includes a substantial number of investment products that are offered through various distribution channels to certain \nhigh-net-worth\n and mass affluent individual investors in the U.S. and other jurisdictions around the world. We expect to continue to expand the number and type of such products that we offer. Our Private Wealth Solutions business is dedicated to building out our distribution capabilities in the private wealth channel to provide certain individual investors with access to Blackstone products across a broad array of alternative investment strategies. In recent years, capital from the private wealth channel has represented an increasing portion of our Total Assets Under Management, and we expect this trend to continue as we continue to undertake initiatives focused on this market segment. \n \n10 \nTable of Contents\nInvestment Process and Risk Management \nWe maintain a rigorous investment process across all our investment vehicles. Each investment vehicle has investment policies and procedures that generally contain requirements, guidelines and limitations for investments, such as limitations relating to the amount that will be invested in any one investment and the types of assets, industries or geographic regions in which the vehicle will invest, as well as limitations required by law. \nOur investment professionals are responsible for identifying, evaluating, underwriting, diligencing, negotiating, executing, managing and exiting investments. For those of our businesses with review committees and/or investment committees, such committees review and evaluate investment opportunities in a framework that includes a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the key risks of investments. In such businesses, investment professionals generally submit investment opportunities for review and approval by a review committee and/or investment committee, subject to delineated exceptions set forth in the funds’ investment committee charters or resolutions. Review and investment committees are generally comprised of senior leaders and other senior professionals of the applicable investment business, and in many cases, other senior leaders of Blackstone and its businesses. Considerations that review and investment committees take into account when evaluating an investment may include, without limitation and depending on the nature of the investing business and its strategy, the quality of the business or asset in which the fund proposes to invest, the quality of the management team, likely exit strategies and factors that could reduce the value of the business or asset at exit, the ability of the business in which the investment is made to service debt in a range of economic and interest rate environments, macroeconomic trends in the relevant geographic region or industry and the quality of the businesses’ operations. In addition, certain of our business units maintain their own sustainability policies that address, among other things, sustainability factors applicable to their respective investment strategies. Existing investments are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis by investment and asset management professionals. In addition, our investment professionals and Portfolio Operations professionals work with our portfolio company senior executives to identify opportunities to drive operational efficiencies and growth. \nBefore our BXMA and Secondaries teams decide to invest in an investment fund or an alternative asset manager, as applicable, they conduct diligence in a number of areas. Depending on the nature of the investment, these areas may include, among others, the fund’s/manager’s performance, investment terms, investment strategy and investment personnel, as well as its operations, processes, risk management and internal controls. With respect to liquid credit clients and other clients whose portfolios are actively traded in our Credit & Insurance segment, our industry-focused research analysts provide the review and/or investment committee with a formal and comprehensive review of new investment recommendations and portfolio managers and trading professionals discuss, among other things, risks associated with overall portfolio composition. Our Credit & Insurance segment’s research team monitors the operating performance of underlying issuers, while portfolio managers, together with our traders, focus on optimizing asset composition to maximize value for our investors. This investment process is assisted by a variety of proprietary and \nnon-proprietary\n research models and methods. \nStructure and Operation of Our Investment Vehicles \nOur asset management businesses include private investment funds, registered funds, BDCs, REITs, CLOs, SMAs and other vehicles focused on real estate, private equity, infrastructure, life sciences, growth equity, credit, real assets and secondary funds. Many of our private investment funds and other vehicles are targeted at institutional investors. We also have several products that are targeted at individual investors, including \nhigh-net-worth\n investors (“Private Wealth Products”). \nOur private investment funds are generally organized as limited partnerships with respect to U.S. domiciled vehicles and limited partnerships or other similar limited liability entities with respect to \nnon-U.S.\n domiciled vehicles. These funds accept commitments and/or subscriptions for investment from institutional investors and/or \nhigh-net-worth\n individuals. Our Private Wealth Products are organized using a variety of structures, including \n \n11 \nTable of Contents\n \ncorporations, statutory trusts, limited partnerships or other vehicles, and accept subscriptions for investment from \nhigh-net-worth\n individuals and/or other individual investors. Our private investment funds are generally either commitment-structured funds, where commitments are generally drawn down from investors on an \nas-needed\n basis to fund investments (or for other permitted purposes) over a specified term, or open-ended funds, where the investor’s capital may be fully funded on or shortly after the investor’s subscription date and cash proceeds resulting from the disposition of investments can be reinvested, subject to certain limitations and limited investor withdrawal rights. In most of our Private Wealth Products, the investor’s capital is fully funded on the subscription date. Our BXCI insurance platform is generally structured around SMAs and our BXCI CLO vehicles are generally private companies with limited liability. \nOur investment funds, SMAs and other vehicles not domiciled in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) are each generally advised by a Blackstone entity serving as investment adviser that is registered under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). For our investment funds, SMAs and other vehicles domiciled in the EEA, a Blackstone entity domiciled in the EEA generally serves as external alternative investment fund manager (“AIFM”), and the AIFM typically delegates its portfolio management function to a Blackstone-affiliated investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. The Blackstone entity serving as investment adviser or AIFM, as applicable, typically carries out substantially all of the \nday-to-day\n operations of each investment vehicle pursuant to an investment advisory, investment management, AIFM or other similar agreement. Generally, the material terms of our investment advisory and AIFM agreements, as applicable, relate to the scope of services to be rendered by the investment adviser or the AIFM to the applicable vehicle, the calculation of management fees to be borne by investors in our investment vehicles, the calculation of and the manner and extent to which other fees received by the investment adviser or the AIFM, as applicable, from funds or fund portfolio companies serve to offset or reduce the management fees payable by investors in our investment vehicles and certain rights of termination with respect to our investment advisory and AIFM agreements. \nOur private investment funds do not generally register as investment companies under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), in reliance on the statutory exemptions provided by Section 3(c)(7), Section 3(c)(5)(C) or Section 3(c)(1) thereof. In addition, each of BXMT and BREIT conducts its operations in a manner that allows it to maintain its REIT qualification and avail itself of the statutory exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act and our U.S. BXPE and BXINFRA vehicles rely on the statutory exemption provided by Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. Our Private Wealth Products include funds that are registered, or regulated as a BDC, under the 1940 Act. In addition, certain of our investment advisers or AIFMs advise or \nsub-advise\n funds domiciled in, and subject to registration and regulatory requirements of, the EEA. \nIn addition to having an investment adviser, each investment fund that is a limited partnership, or “partnership” fund, also has a general partner that, apart from partnership funds domiciled in the EEA, generally makes all operational and investment decisions, including the making, monitoring and disposing of investments. Investment vehicles in our Private Wealth Products typically have a board that includes independent directors. In the case of our SMAs, the investor, rather than we, generally holds or has custody of the investments. The investors in our investment funds generally take no part in the conduct or control of the business of the investment funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind the investment funds and have no influence over the voting or disposition of the securities or other assets held by the investment funds. Third-party investors in some of our partnership funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund or to accelerate the termination of the fund without cause by a majority or supermajority vote. In addition, the governing agreements of many of our partnership funds provide that in the event certain “key persons” in our partnership funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund, then (a) investors in such funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period by a specified percentage (including, in certain cases a simple majority) vote in accordance with specified procedures, or accelerate the withdrawal of their capital on an \ninvestor-by-investor\n basis, or (b) the fund’s investment period will automatically terminate and a specified percentage (including, in certain cases a simple majority) in accordance with specified procedures is required to restart it. In addition, the governing agreements of some of our partnership funds provide that investors have the right to terminate the investment period for any reason by a supermajority vote of the investors in such fund. \n \n12 \nTable of Contents\nFee Structure/Incentive Arrangements \nManagement Fees \nThe following is a general description of the management fees earned by Blackstone. Management fees are generally based on an annual rate but payable on a regular basis (typically monthly or quarterly). Management fees received are not subject to clawback. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nIn our carry funds, the investment adviser or AIFM (depending on the domicile of the fund) receives a management fee based on a percentage of the fund’s capital commitments, invested capital and/or undeployed capital during the investment period and the fund’s invested capital, investment fair value or capital commitments after the investment period. Management fees are generally payable over either the term or life of the fund. Depending on the fee basis, negative performance of one or more investments in the fund may reduce the total management fee paid for the relevant period, but not the fee rate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nIn our other fund structures, unless outlined differently below, the investment adviser or AIFM (depending on the domicile of the fund) receives a management fee based on a percentage of the fund’s net asset value over the term or life of the fund. These funds may permit investors to withdraw or redeem their interests periodically, in some cases following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn. Decreases in net asset value reduce the total management fee paid for the relevant period, but not the fee rate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nIn our CLOs, the investment adviser typically receives a base management fee and a subordinated management fee, which are calculated as a percentage of the CLO’s assets. Although varying from deal to deal, a CLO will typically be wound down within eight to eleven years of being launched. The amount of fees will decrease as the CLO deleverages toward the end of its term. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nIn our separately managed accounts, the investment adviser generally receives a management fee based on a percentage of each account’s net asset value or invested capital. Such management fees are generally subject to contractual rights the investor has to terminate our management on generally as short as 30 days’ notice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nIn our credit-focused registered investment companies and our BDCs, the investment adviser typically receives a management fee based on a percentage of net asset value or total managed assets. Such management fees are generally subject to contractual rights of the company’s board of directors to terminate our management of an account on as short as 30 days’ notice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor BXMT, the investment adviser receives a management fee based on a percentage of BXMT’s net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated “distributable earnings” (which is generally equal to its net income, calculated under GAAP, excluding certain \nnon-cash\n and other items), subject to certain adjustments. \nFor additional information regarding the management fee rates we receive, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Revenue Recognition — Management and Advisory Fees, Net.” \nIncentive Arrangements \nOur incentive arrangements are composed of (a) contractual incentive fees received from certain investment vehicles upon achieving specified cumulative investment returns (“Incentive Fees”), and (b) a disproportionate allocation of the income generated by investment vehicles otherwise allocable to investors upon achieving certain investment returns (“Performance Allocations”, and, together with Incentive Fees, “Performance Revenues”). \n \n13 \nTable of Contents\nIn our carry funds, our Performance Revenues consist of the Performance Allocations to which the general partner or an affiliate thereof is entitled, commonly referred to as carried interest. Our ability to generate and realize carried interest is an important element of our business and has historically accounted for a very significant portion of our income. \nCarried interest is typically structured as a net profits interest in the applicable fund. In the case of our carry funds, carried interest is generally calculated on a “realized gain” basis, and each general partner (or affiliate) is generally entitled to an allocation of up to 20% of the net realized income and gains (generally taking into account realized and unrealized or net unrealized losses) generated by such fund. Net realized income or loss is not generally netted between or among funds, and in some cases our carry funds provide for allocations to be made on current income distributions (subject to certain conditions). \nFor most carry funds, the carried interest is subject to a preferred limited partner return generally ranging from 5% to 8% per year, subject to a \ncatch-up\n allocation to the general partner. Some of our carry funds do not provide for a preferred return, and generally the terms of our carry funds vary in certain respects across our business units and vintages. If, at the end of the life of a carry fund (or earlier with respect to certain of our carry funds), as a result of diminished performance of later investments in a carry fund’s life, (a) the general partner receives in excess of the relevant carried interest percentage(s) applicable to the fund as applied to the fund’s cumulative net profits over the life of the fund, or (in certain cases) (b) the carry fund has not achieved investment returns that exceed the preferred return threshold (if applicable), then we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the carried interest that was previously distributed to us that exceeds the amounts to which we were ultimately entitled, up to the amount of carried interest received on an \nafter-tax\n basis. This is known as a “clawback” obligation and is an obligation of any person who received such carried interest, including us and other participants in our carried interest plans. \nAlthough a portion of any dividends paid to our stockholder may include any carried interest received by us, we do not intend to seek fulfillment of any clawback obligation by seeking to have our stockholders return any portion of such dividends attributable to carried interest associated with any clawback obligation. To the extent we are required to fulfill a clawback obligation, however, we may determine to decrease the amount of our dividends to our stockholders. The clawback obligation operates with respect to a given carry fund’s own net investment performance only and carried interest of other funds is not netted for determining this contingent obligation. Moreover, although a clawback obligation is several, the governing agreements of most of our funds provide that to the extent another recipient of carried interest (such as a current or former employee) does not fund his or her respective share of the clawback obligation then due, then we and our employees who participate in such carried interest plans may have to fund additional amounts (generally an additional 50% to 70% beyond our \npro-rata\n share of such obligation) although we retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. We have recorded a contingent repayment obligation equal to the amount that would be due on December 31, 2024, if the various carry funds were liquidated at their current carrying value. For additional information concerning the clawback obligations we could face, see “—Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — We may not have sufficient cash to pay back “clawback” obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our investors.” \nIn our structures other than carry funds, our Performance Revenues generally consist of performance-based allocations of a vehicle’s net capital appreciation during a measurement period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels, high water marks, loss carry forwards and/or other hurdle provisions, in accordance with the respective terms set out in each vehicle’s governing agreements. Such allocations are typically realized at the end of the measurement period and, once realized, are typically not subject to clawback or reversal. In particular, our ability to generate and realize these amounts is an important element of our business. Such allocations in certain of our Perpetual Capital strategies contribute a significant and growing portion to our overall revenues. \n \n14 \nTable of Contents\nThe following is a general description of the Performance Revenues earned by Blackstone in structures other than carry funds: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe general partners of certain open-ended BPP and BIP funds are entitled to an incentive fee allocation generally between 7% and 12.5% of net profit, subject to a hurdle amount generally of between 5.5% and 7%, a loss recovery amount and a \ncatch-up.\n Incentive allocations for these funds are generally realized every three years from when a limited partner makes its initial investment, or upon a limited partner’s redemption from the fund. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe general partner or special limited partner of each of BREIT, BEPIF, BXPE and BXINFRA receives a performance participation allocation of 12.5% of total return, subject to a 5% hurdle amount with a \ncatch-up\n and recouping any loss carry forward amounts, measured annually and payable quarterly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe investment adviser of our BDCs receives (a) income incentive fees of 12.5% or 17.5%, as applicable, subject to, in certain cases, certain hurdles, \ncatch-ups\n and caps, payable quarterly, and (b) capital gains incentive fees (net of realized and unrealized losses) of 12.5% or 17.5%, as applicable, payable annually. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe general partners or similar entities of each of our real estate and credit hedge fund structures receive incentive fees of generally up to 20% of the applicable fund’s net capital appreciation per annum. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe investment manager of BXMT receives an incentive fee generally equal to 20% of BXMT’s distributable earnings in excess of a 7% per annum return on stockholders’ equity (excluding stock appreciation or depreciation), provided that BXMT’s distributable earnings over the prior three years is greater than zero. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nIn our Multi-Asset Investing segment, the investment adviser of certain of our funds of hedge funds, hedge or multi-strategy funds, separately managed accounts that invest in hedge funds and certain \nnon-U.S.\n registered investment companies, is entitled to an incentive fee generally between 0% to 20%, as applicable, of the applicable investment vehicle’s net appreciation, subject to “high water mark” provisions and in some cases a preferred return. \nAdvisory and Transaction Fees \nSome of our investment advisers or their affiliates receive customary fees (for example, acquisition, origination and other transaction fees) upon consummation of their funds’ transactions, and may from time to time receive advisory, monitoring and other fees in connection with their activities. For most of the funds where we receive such fees, we are required to reduce the management fees charged to the funds’ investors by 50% to 100% of such limited partner’s share of such fees. \nCapital Invested In and Alongside Our Investment Funds \nTo further align our interests with those of investors in our investment funds, we have invested the firm’s capital and that of our personnel in the investment funds we sponsor and manage. Minimum general partner capital commitments to our investment funds are determined separately with respect to each of our investment funds and, generally, are less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of any particular fund. See “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information regarding our minimum general partner capital commitments to our funds. We determine whether to make general partner capital commitments to our funds in excess of the minimum required commitments based on, among other things, our anticipated liquidity, working capital and \n \n15 \nTable of Contents\nother capital needs. In many cases, we require our senior managing directors and other professionals to fund a portion of the general partner capital commitments to our funds. In other cases, we may from time to time offer to our senior managing directors and employees a part of the funded or unfunded general partner commitments to our investment funds. Our general partner capital commitments are funded with cash and not with carried interest or deferral of management fees. \nInvestors in many of our funds also receive the opportunity to make additional \n“co-investments”\n with the investment funds. Our personnel, as well as Blackstone itself and certain Blackstone relationships, also have the opportunity to make investments, in or alongside our funds and other vehicles we manage, in some instances without being subject to management fees, carried interest or incentive fees. In certain cases, limited partner investors may pay additional management fees or carried interest in connection with such \nco-investments.\n \nCompetition \nThe asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We compete both globally and on a regional, industry and sector basis. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including investment performance, transaction execution skills, access to capital, access to and retention of qualified personnel, reputation, range of products and services, innovation and price. \nWe face competition in the pursuit of institutional and individual investors for our investment funds. Although over time many institutional and individual investors have increased the amount of capital they commit to alternative investment funds, such increases may create increased competition with respect to fees charged by our funds. Certain institutional investors have demonstrated a preference to \nin-source\n their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us. We compete for investments with such institutional investors and such institutional investors could cease to be our clients. In the private wealth and insurance channels, the market for capital is highly competitive, requires significant investment and is highly regulated, which could create competitive challenges for us. In the private wealth channel, the willingness of our competitors to pay higher or differing types of distributor fees increases competition for fundraising. \nWe also face competition in the pursuit of attractive investment opportunities for our funds. Depending on the investment, we face competition primarily from sponsors managing other funds, investment vehicles and other pools of capital, other financial institutions and institutional investors (including sovereign wealth and pension funds), corporate buyers and other parties. Several of these competitors have significant amounts of capital and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources or other resources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings with regard to an investment or be perceived by sellers as otherwise being more desirable bidders, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment. \nIn all of our businesses, competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. \nFor additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see “—Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — The asset management business is intensely competitive.” \n \n16 \nTable of Contents\n \n \nSustainability \nOur investors have relied on our relentless commitment to excellence for nearly 40 years. Our \nsustainability \nefforts are anchored in our goal of generating strong returns for investors to fulfill our fiduciary duty. We have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition. Our approach includes efforts to help select portfolio companies measure emissions and capture cost savings through energy management. Senior management reports quarterly to our board of directors, which reviews our sustainability strategy, including on the basis of periodic reports from management addressing relevant matters and practices. \nAt Blackstone, our people are our most valuable asset. We believe teams with a diverse breadth of backgrounds and experiences contribute to better outcomes. We believe building inclusive workplaces positions us and our portfolio companies to access a broad pool of qualified talent, including from historically under-tapped talent pools, and foster inclusive cultures that generate lasting value for our investors. See “— Human Capital Management.” \nHuman Capital Management \nBlackstone’s employees are integral to our culture of integrity, professionalism, excellence and cooperation, and the intellectual capital possessed by them is critical to our success. \nWe believe a workforce reflecting a diverse breadth of backgrounds and experiences makes us better investors and a better firm. Our talent strategy leverages a people-driven framework based on four key pillars: recruiting, talent development, community and inclusion, and accountability. We believe that by focusing on each of these pillars and investing in our people and our culture, we will create an inclusive environment that helps expand our access to the best available talent and drives retention and advancement opportunities for our employees. \nTo that end, our employee resource groups, which are open to all employees, serve as a platform for our professionals to expand cultural awareness and connect to other employees, including through speaker series, professional development opportunities and social events. We also seek to enable ourselves and our portfolio companies to access a broad pool of qualified talent, including through firm programs aimed at introducing talented undergraduate students to financial services and Blackstone and portfolio programs aimed at helping our portfolio companies access historically under-tapped talent pools. \nOur board of directors plays an active role in reviewing our human capital management efforts. To that end, senior management reviews with our board of directors management succession planning and development and other key aspects of our talent management strategy. \nEmployee and Community Engagement \nBlackstone is committed to ensuring our employees are engaged with their work and with their local communities. Blackstone regularly gathers feedback from our employees via internal and/or external surveys to assess employee engagement and satisfaction and develop targeted solutions. Blackstone also supports its employee resource groups in their efforts to expand cultural awareness and connection across the firm. \nIn addition, the Blackstone Charitable Foundation (“BXCF”) was established in 2007 and is committed to supporting Blackstone’s goal of helping foster economic opportunity and career mobility. This includes, among other initiatives, its signature Blackstone LaunchPad network, which seeks to close the opportunity gap by equipping college and university students with the entrepreneurial skills they need to build lasting careers, and BX Connects, a global program that provides Blackstone employees with the opportunity to support their local communities through volunteering and giving. BX Connects uses the firm’s scale, talent and resources to make grants, develop nonprofit partnerships and create employee engagement opportunities. Nearly 90% of our employees engaged globally with BXCF’s charitable initiatives in 2024. \n \n17 \nTable of Contents\nTalent Acquisition, Development and Retention \nWe believe the talent of our employees, coupled with our rigorous investment process, has supported our excellent investment record over many years. We hire qualified people, train them and encourage them to work together to provide their best thinking to the firm for the benefit of the investors in the funds we manage. Across all our businesses, we face intense competition for qualified personnel. \nWe seek to attract and retain the brightest minds across a wide spectrum of disciplines and from varied backgrounds and experiences. We believe our reputation, talent development opportunities and compensation make us an attractive employer. We encourage independent thinking and reward initiative while providing training and development opportunities to help our employees grow professionally. In addition, our Respect at Work programs and trainings help maintain an inclusive work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Employee education and training are also critical to maintaining a culture of compliance. \nBlackstone offers a wide range of learning and professional development opportunities, both formally and informally, to help employees advance their careers and maximize the value they can add to the global firm. Incoming analyst classes are provided with training that spans their first few years. In addition, our new hires are provided with training and other opportunities to help them thrive in our culture, including through our Culture Program and our Leadership Speaker Series. Blackstone employees are trained or enrolled in compliance training when they start at the firm, and we retrain employees globally at least once annually. Over the course of their careers at Blackstone, employees are offered learning opportunities in a number of areas including leadership and management development and communication skills, among others. We offer a global development curriculum on key capabilities required to succeed at Blackstone, and we partner with external organizations to deliver training programs for our employees. We consistently seek to create visibility and opportunities for talent to take on roles beyond their current positions, and for managers to connect regularly to discuss and match talent with critical roles. These efforts result in cross-pollination of talent that we believe engages our people and generates stronger outcomes for the firm. \nAs discussed below, we seek to retain and incentivize the performance of our employees through our compensation structure. We also enter into \nnon-competition\n and \nnon-solicitation\n agreements with certain employees. See “Part III. Item 11. Executive Compensation — \nNon-Competition\n and \nNon-Solicitation\n Agreements” for a description of the material terms of such agreements. \nCompensation, Benefits and Wellness \nOur compensation is designed to motivate and retain employees and align their interests with those of the investors in our funds. In particular, incentive compensation for our senior managing directors and employees involves a combination of annual cash bonus payments and performance interests or deferred equity awards, which we believe encourages them to focus on the performance of our investment funds and the overall performance of the firm. The proportion of compensation that is “at risk” generally increases as an employee’s level of responsibility rises. Employees at higher total compensation levels are generally targeted to receive a greater percentage of their total compensation payable in annual cash bonuses, participation in performance interests and deferred equity awards and a lesser percentage in the form of base salary compared to employees at lower total compensation levels. To further align their interests with those of investors in our funds, we provide employees with the opportunity to make investments in or alongside certain of the funds and other vehicles we manage. We also provide our employees and their families robust health and wellbeing offerings, including \ntime-off\n options and family planning resources. \nWe believe our current compensation and benefit allocations for senior professionals are best in class and are consistent with companies in the alternative asset management industry. Our senior management periodically reviews the effectiveness and competitiveness of our compensation program. Most of our current senior managing \n \n18 \nTable of Contents\ndirectors and other senior personnel have equity interests in our business that entitle such personnel to cash distributions. See “Part III. Item 11. Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Overview of Compensation Philosophy and Program” for more information on compensation of our senior managing directors and certain other employees. \nWe care greatly about the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees. Blackstone also offers comprehensive and competitive benefits to its full-time employees, including, without limitation, primary and secondary caregiver leave, adoption leave, fertility coverage and back up childcare. In addition, we offer additional family planning benefits for employees such as infertility benefits, including cryopreservation and primary caregiver leave for a minimum of 21 weeks. We offer employee well-being programs that provide information, tools and resources, including connections to immediate support, community referrals and counseling. We have partnered with various platforms to provide \non-demand\n emotional and mental health support and personalized support and resources for employees and their families throughout all stages of life. \nData Privacy and Security \nBlackstone is committed to data privacy. We provide data privacy training at onboarding to new employees and at least annually to existing employees. Data privacy is typically addressed in the Global Head of Compliance’s annual update to our board of directors. Blackstone’s approach to data privacy is set out in our Online Privacy Notice and Investor Data Privacy Notice. Our privacy function, which involves conducting privacy impact assessments, implementing \nprivacy-by-design\n initiatives and reconciling global privacy programs with local privacy requirements, is led by our Data and Policy Strategy Officer and overseen by the Data Protection Operating Committee, Blackstone’s global privacy compliance steering committee. Please see “—Item 1C. Cybersecurity” for a discussion of our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. \nRegulatory and Compliance Matters \nOur businesses, as well as the financial services industry generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and in many of the markets in which we operate. \nOur business is subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, \nnon-U.S.\n governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations, state securities regulators and international securities regulators have in recent years increased their regulatory activities, including regulation, examination and enforcement in respect of asset management firms, including Blackstone. Any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation. Our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires us to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by financial regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or abroad, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability. \nAll of the investment advisers of our investment funds operating in the U.S. are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Advisers Act (other investment advisers may be registered in \nnon-U.S.\n jurisdictions). Registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to advisory clients, maintaining an effective compliance program and code of ethics, investment advisory contracts, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure, advertising and custody requirements, political contributions, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an adviser and advisory clients, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. Certain investment advisers are also registered with international regulators in connection with their management of products that are locally distributed and/or regulated. \n \n19 \nTable of Contents\nBlackstone Securities Partners L.P. (“BSP”), a subsidiary through which we conduct our capital markets business and certain of our fund marketing and distribution, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or “FINRA,” and is registered as a broker-dealer in 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among others, the implementation of a supervisory control system over the securities business, advertising and sales practices, conduct of and compensation in connection with public securities offerings, maintenance of adequate net capital, record keeping and the conduct and qualifications of employees. In addition, FINRA, a self-regulatory organization subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including BSP. State securities regulators also have regulatory oversight authority over BSP. \nIn addition, certain of the \nclosed-end\n and \nopen-end\n investment companies we manage, advise or \nsub-advise\n are registered, or regulated as a BDC, under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act and the rules thereunder govern, among other things, the relationship between us and such investment vehicles and limit such investment vehicles’ ability to enter into certain transactions with us or our affiliates, including other funds managed, advised or \nsub-advised\n by us. \nPursuant to the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, or “FSMA,” certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). The FSMA and rules promulgated thereunder form the cornerstone of legislation which governs all aspects of our investment business in the United Kingdom, including sales, provision of investment advice, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, regulatory capital, recordkeeping, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering, periodic reporting and settlement procedures. Blackstone Europe LLP (“BELL”) acts as a \nsub-advisor\n to its Blackstone U.S. affiliates in relation to the investment and \nre-investment\n of Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) based assets of Blackstone Funds, arranging transactions to be entered into by or on behalf of Blackstone Funds, and providing certain related services. BELL’s principal place of business is in London, and it has a branch in Abu Dhabi Global Market. BELL does not currently have a MiFID II cross border passport to provide investment services into the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Accordingly, BELL can only provide investment services in certain EEA jurisdictions where it has obtained a domestic license on a cross-border services basis (currently, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Spain and Italy), or can operate pursuant to an exemption or relief (currently Ireland, Liechtenstein and Norway). These operations are, however, in certain cases subject to limitations. \nBlackstone Ireland Limited (“BIL”) is authorized and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”) as an Investment Firm under the (Irish) European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017, as amended (the “MiFID Regulations”). BIL’s principal activity is the provision of management and advisory services to certain CLOs and \nsub-advisory\n services to certain Blackstone affiliates. Blackstone Ireland Fund Management Limited (“BIFM”) is authorized and regulated by the CBI as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the (Irish) European Union (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations) 2013 (“AIFMRs”). BIFM acts as AIFM and provides investment management functions including portfolio management, risk management, administration, marketing and related activities to its alternative investment funds in accordance with AIFMRs and the conditions imposed by the CBI as set out in the CBI’s alternative investment fund rulebook. \nBlackstone Europe Fund Management S.à r.l. (“BEFM”) is authorized as (a) an Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the Luxembourg Law of 12 July 2013 on alternative investment fund managers (as amended, the “AIFM Law”), which implements AIFMD in Luxembourg and (b) a management company under the Law of 17 December 2010 on undertakings for collective investment (as amended, the “UCITS Law”), which implements UCITS Directive in Luxembourg. BEFM may also provide discretionary portfolio management services and investment advice in accordance with the AIFM Law and the UCITS Law, as well as reception and transmission of orders. BEFM provides investment management functions including portfolio management, risk management, \n \n20 \nTable of Contents\nadministration, marketing and related activities to its managed funds, in accordance with the AIFM Law, UCITS Law and the regulatory provisions imposed by the \nCommission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier\n in Luxembourg. BEFM also promotes Blackstone products and services in European countries where BELL is not otherwise licensed to do so. BEFM has branches in Paris, Milan and Frankfurt which provide marketing services and where distribution and deal sourcing individuals are based. \nCertain Blackstone operating entities are licensed and subject to regulation by financial regulatory authorities in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore: The Blackstone Group Japan K.K., a financial instruments firm, is registered with Kanto Local Finance Bureau and regulated by the Japan Financial Services Agency; The Blackstone Group (HK) Limited is regulated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission; The Blackstone Group (Australia) Pty Limited and Blackstone Real Estate Australia Pty Limited each holds an Australian financial services license authorizing it to provide financial services in Australia and is regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; and Blackstone Singapore Pte. Ltd. is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. \nRigorous legal and compliance analysis of our businesses and investments is endemic to our culture and risk management. Our Chief Legal Officer and Global Head of Compliance, together with the Chief Compliance Officers of each of our businesses, supervise our compliance personnel, who are responsible for addressing the regulatory and compliance matters that affect our activities. We strive to maintain a culture of compliance through the use of policies and procedures including a code of ethics, electronic compliance systems, testing and monitoring, communication of compliance guidance and employee education and training. Our compliance policies and procedures address regulatory and compliance matters such as the handling of material \nnon-public\n information, personal securities trading, marketing practices, gifts and entertainment, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and sanctions, valuation of investments on a fund-specific basis, recordkeeping, potential conflicts of interest, the allocation of investment and \nco-investment\n opportunities, collection of fees and expense allocation. \nOur compliance group also monitors the information barriers that we maintain between Blackstone’s businesses. We believe that our various businesses’ access to the intellectual knowledge and contacts and relationships that reside throughout our firm benefits all of our businesses. To maximize that access and related synergies without compromising compliance with our legal and contractual obligations, our compliance group oversees and monitors the communications between groups that are on the private side of our information barrier and groups that are on the public side, as well as between different public side groups. Our compliance group also monitors contractual obligations that may be impacted and potential conflicts that may arise in connection with these inter-group discussions. \nIn addition, disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are documented, tested and assessed for design and operating effectiveness in accordance with the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Internal Audit, which independently reports to the audit committee of our board of directors, operates with a global mandate and is responsible for the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the organization’s governance and risk management processes and internal controls. Internal Audit is designed to improve our firmwide operations through a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, internal controls, and governance processes. Internal Audit conducts its audits in accordance with professional standards, and its findings and recommendations are reported to senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors. \nOur enterprise risk management framework is designed to manage \nnon-investment\n risk areas across the firm, such as financial, human capital, legal, operational, regulatory, legislative, reputational and technology risks. Our enterprise risk committee assists Blackstone management to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate such key enterprise risks at the corporate, business unit and fund level. The enterprise risk committee is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and is comprised of senior management across business units, corporate functions and regional locations. Senior management reports to the audit committee of the board of directors on the agenda of risk topics evaluated by the enterprise risk committee and provides periodic risk reports, a summary of key risks to the firm, and detailed assessments of selected risks, as applicable. \n \n21 \nTable of Contents\n \nAdditionally, our firmwide valuation committee reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. The firmwide valuation committee is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and is comprised of members of senior management, senior leaders from our businesses and representatives from legal and finance. \nFurther, the review committees and/or investment committees of our businesses review and evaluate investment opportunities in a framework that includes a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the key risks of investments. See “—Investment Process and Risk Management.” \nThere are a number of pending or recently enacted legislative and regulatory initiatives that could significantly affect our business. Please see “—Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business”, “—Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus, could result in additional burdens on our business” and “—Complex regulatory regimes and potential regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.” \nAvailable Information, Website and Social Media Disclosure \nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports and other information with the SEC.

  "item7": "Item 7.\n\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Blackstone Inc.’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included within this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\n \nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of Exhibit 99.1 of Blackstone’s Current Report on \nForm 8-K\n filed on November 25, 2024. \nOur Business \nBlackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager. Our business is organized into four segments: Real Estate, Private Equity, Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing. For more information about our business segments, see “Part I. Item 1. Business — Business Segments.” \nWe generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies, and from capital markets services. We also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a \npro-rata\n share of the income of the fund (a \n“pro-rata\n allocation”). In addition to a \npro-rata\n allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest (“Performance Allocations”). In certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment vehicle based on achieving certain investment returns (an “Incentive Fee,” and together with Performance Allocations, “Performance Revenues”). The composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. Net investment gains and investment income generated by the Blackstone Funds are driven by the performance of the underlying investments as well as overall market conditions. Fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio companies and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions. \nBusiness Environment \nBlackstone’s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world. \nGlobal markets experienced volatility in 2024, due to significant movement in Treasury yields, a strong U.S. Dollar, global geopolitical instability and macroeconomic uncertainty. The \n10-year\n Treasury yield increased 86 basis points from the beginning of 2024 to an intraday high of 4.74% in April, declined 114 basis points to an intraday low of 3.6% in September, and subsequently rose again to end the year at 4.57%. Short-term rates decreased in 2024 with three-month SOFR down 103 basis points to 4.31%. The U.S. Dollar appreciated against major currencies in the fourth quarter and full year, including the Pound Sterling, Euro, Canadian Dollar, and Indian Rupee. \nMost major equity markets appreciated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The S&P 500 delivered a total return of 2.0% in the fourth quarter and 25.0% for the full year. All sectors gained during the year, led by the telecom sector, which rose 40.2%. In credit markets, the S&P leveraged loan index increased 9.0% in 2024 while the Credit Suisse high yield bond index rose 7.9%. High yield spreads tightened 57 basis points in 2024, while issuance increased 64% year-over-year. Base rates were volatile during the year. Equity market volatility increased, with the CBOE Volatility Index up 39% year-over-year. Oil prices were largely unchanged, with the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil up 0.1% in 2024 to $71.72 per barrel. The Henry Hub Natural Gas spot price increased 45% year-over-year to $3.63. \n \n86 \nTable of Contents\nThe U.S. economy exhibited steady growth in 2024, underpinned by a healthy labor market and consumer spending. The advance estimate of U.S. real GDP for 2024 indicated growth of 2.8% year-over-year, in line with 2.9% growth recorded in 2023. Inflation decreased moderately over the course of 2024, with headline CPI decreasing from 3.1% year-over-year growth in January 2024 to 2.9% in December 2024, and Core CPI decreasing from 3.9% year-over-year growth in January 2024 to 3.2% year-over-year in December 2024. The Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds target range three times in 2024 to \n4.25%-4.50%\n by year end. The Federal Reserve held rates steady in January 2025, indicating its expectations for a slower pace of rate cuts moving forward. The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1% in December 2024, but further decreased below forecasts to 4.0% in January 2025, suggesting a tightening labor market. Average hourly earnings increasing 4.1% year-over-year and 0.5% month-over-month in January 2025. Meanwhile, shelter cost inflation has decreased since the end of 2023, declining to 4.6% in December 2024 as compared to 6.2% the prior year. In manufacturing, the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers’ Index increased to 49.2 in December 2024 compared to 46.9 in 2023. \nOutside the U.S., several major economies demonstrated slower GDP growth and began loosening monetary policy after an extended period of tightening due to decreasing inflation. Eurozone real GDP declined to 2.4% annual growth in December 2024 from 2.9% in December 2023. Inflation in the Eurozone fell from 2.8% year-over-year growth in January 2024 to 2.4% at year end despite the European Central Bank lowering its deposit facility by 100 basis points during the year and an additional 25 basis points in February 2025. In China, real GDP grew 5.0% year-over-year in 2024, down from 5.4% in 2023 and below the average of the preceding ten years. In Japan, the advance estimate of real GDP indicated a contraction of 0.2% year-over-year in 2024, down from 1.5% growth in 2023. \nCapital markets activity expanded moderately, with global initial public offering volumes up 4% and global announced merger and acquisition volumes up 12% compared to 2023; however, both metrics remain below prior peak levels. \nDuring 2024, the U.S. made meaningful progress on inflation and maintained a healthy economy, which helped improve investor sentiment. Nonetheless, continued geopolitical turbulence, the potential for slower-than-anticipated interest rate decreases, and U.S. trade, immigration and other policy and regulatory changes are contributing to economic outlook uncertainty, including a potential economic slowdown. \nNotable Transactions \nOn December 6, 2024, Blackstone, through its indirect subsidiary Blackstone Reg Finance Co. L.L.C., issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due December 6, 2034 pursuant to a Registration Statement on \nForm S-3\n (the “Registered 2034 Notes”). \nFor additional information see Note 12. “Borrowings” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —Sources and Uses of Liquidity.” \n \n87 \nTable of Contents\nOrganizational Structure \nThe simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. The diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held. \n \n\n\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators \nWe manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “— Critical Accounting Policies.” Our key \nnon-GAAP\n financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below. \nDistributable Earnings \nDistributable Earnings is derived from Blackstone’s segment reported results. Distributable Earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to Blackstone stockholders, including Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. Distributable Earnings is the sum of Segment Distributable Earnings plus Net Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) less Taxes and Related Payables. Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See \n“— Non-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Distributable Earnings. \n \n88 \nTable of Contents\nNet Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to Interest and Dividend Revenue less Interest Expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of Blackstone Funds, and interest expense associated with the Tax Receivable Agreement. \nTaxes and Related Payables represent the total GAAP tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and including the Payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating Taxes and Related Payables and Distributable Earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of Segment Distributable Earnings and Total Segment Distributable Earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items where there is a current tax provision or benefit. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for Blackstone’s Consolidated Statements of Operations under GAAP, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingencies and refunds which are reflected when paid or received. Management believes that including the amount payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating Distributable Earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to stockholders. \nSegment Distributable Earnings \nSegment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone’s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone’s four segments. Blackstone believes it is useful to stockholders to review the measure that management uses in assessing segment performance. Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone’s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone’s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates \nnon-controlling\n ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items. Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses or other charges that affect \nperiod-to-period\n comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone’s operational performance. Segment Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “— \nNon-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Segment Distributable Earnings. \nNet Realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues (which refers to Realized Performance Revenues excluding Fee Related Performance Revenues), less Realized Performance Compensation (which refers to Realized Performance Compensation excluding Fee Related Performance Compensation and Equity-Based Performance Compensation). \nRealized Performance Compensation reflects an increase in the aggregate Realized Performance Compensation paid to certain of our professionals above the amounts allocable to them based upon the percentage participation in the relevant performance plans previously awarded to them. In the year ended December 31, 2024, Realized Performance Compensation increased by an aggregate of $83.1 million and Fee Related Compensation decreased by a corresponding amount. In the year ended December 31, 2023, Realized Performance Compensation increased by an aggregate of $65.0 million and Fee Related Compensation decreased by a corresponding amount. These changes to Realized Performance Compensation and Fee Related Compensation reduced Net Realizations, increased Fee Related Earnings and had a neutral impact to Income Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and Distributable Earnings in the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n \n89 \nTable of Contents\nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings is a performance measure used to assess Blackstone’s ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. Blackstone believes Fee Related Earnings is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the profitability of the portion of Blackstone’s business that is not dependent on realization activity. Fee Related Earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (a) Fee Related Compensation on a segment basis and (b) Other Operating Expenses. Fee Related Earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “— \nNon-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Fee Related Earnings. \nFee Related Compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding Equity-Based Compensation, directly related to (a) Management and Advisory Fees, Net and (b) Fee Related Performance Revenues, referred to as Fee Related Performance Compensation. \nFee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of Performance Revenues from Perpetual Capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. \nOther Operating Expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to General, Administrative and Other Expenses, adjusted to (a) remove transaction-related and \nnon-recurring\n items that arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses or other charges, if any, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the Blackstone Funds which are netted against Management and Advisory Fees, Net in Blackstone’s segment presentation and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone’s segment presentation. \nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization \nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from Blackstone’s segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. Adjusted EBITDA represents Distributable Earnings plus the addition of (a) Interest Expense on a segment basis, (b) Taxes and Related Payables and (c) Depreciation and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “— \nNon-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. \nNet Accrued Performance Revenues \nNet Accrued Performance Revenues is a \nnon-GAAP\n financial measure Blackstone believes is useful to stockholders as an indicator of potential future realized performance revenues based on the current investment portfolio of the funds and vehicles we manage. Net Accrued Performance Revenues represents the accrued performance revenues receivable by Blackstone, net of the related accrued performance compensation payable by Blackstone, excluding performance revenues that have been realized but not yet distributed as of the reporting date and clawback amounts, if any. Net Accrued Performance Revenues is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Investments. See “— \nNon-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Net Accrued Performance Revenues and Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Equity Method Investments” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information on the calculation of Investments — Accrued Performance Allocations. \n \n90 \nTable of Contents\n \nOperating Metrics \nThe alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third-party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. Since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies. \nTotal and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management \n“Total Assets Under Management” refers to the invested and available capital in Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles (including, without limitation, investment funds and SMAs). The Total Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is dependent on the structure and investment strategy of such vehicle and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Total Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(a)\n\n\na vehicle’s invested capital at fair value which, as applicable, is measured as (1) total investments measured at fair value, or gross asset values, each of which may include the fair value of investments purchased with leverage under certain credit facilities, (2) net asset value, or (3) amount of debt and equity outstanding or aggregate par amount of assets, including principal cash for CLOs, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(b)\n\n\na vehicle’s available capital, if any, which represents (1) uncalled commitments made by investors and (2) available borrowing capacity under certain credit facilities. \nUncalled commitments represent the capital we are entitled to call from investors pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods. Drawdown funds, perpetual capital vehicles, \nco-investment\n vehicles, and SMAs can each be structured with a commitment from an investor that is called over time as opposed to fully funded upon subscription. \nAssets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. Total Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the assets are managed. \nOur measurement of Total Assets Under Management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from Blackstone and our personnel. Our calculation of Total Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of Total Assets Under Management differs from the manner in which affiliated investment advisors report regulatory assets under management and may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles we manage or advise. \n“Fee-Earning\n Assets Under Management” refers to the portion of Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees and/or performance revenues. The \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is driven by the basis on which fees are earned and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: (a) net asset value, (b) committed capital and remaining invested capital during the investment period and post-investment period, respectively, (c) invested capital (including leverage to the extent management \nfee-eligible),\n (d) gross asset value, (e) fair value of investments, or (f) the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of CLOs. \n \n91 \nTable of Contents\nAssets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the Total Assets Under Management are reported to the extent \nfee-paying\n to Blackstone. \nWhile \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management generally reflects Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees, \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may also include Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn only performance revenues. Our calculation of \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles that we manage or advise. \nCommitment-based drawdown structured funds generally do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. Certain of our open-ended vehicles generally afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days’ notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Investment advisory agreements related to certain SMAs in our Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments, excluding SMAs in our insurance platform, may generally be terminated by an investor on 15 to 95 days’ notice. SMAs in our insurance platform can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to Blackstone’s right to cure. \nPerpetual Capital \n“Perpetual Capital” refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows or where required redemptions are limited in quantum. Perpetual Capital includes \nco-investment\n capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. \nIn our Perpetual Capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Perpetual Capital includes \nco-investment\n capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it represents capital we manage that has a longer duration and the ability to generate recurring revenues in a different manner than traditional fund structures. \nDry Powder \nDry Powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the extent to which capital is available for Blackstone to deploy capital into investment opportunities as they arise. \n \n92 \nTable of Contents\nInvested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management \nInvested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management represents invested capital at fair value on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met. We believe Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the capital deployed that has the potential to generate performance revenues. \nConsolidated Results of Operations \nFollowing is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of our four business segments (which are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds, eliminates \nnon-controlling\n ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships and removes the amortization of intangibles assets and Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items) in these periods, see “— Segment Analysis” below. \n \n93 \nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations and certain key operating

increase of $5.2 billion, compared to $8.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.3 billion in Investment Income, which was composed of increases of $3.0 billion in Unrealized Investment Income and $1.3 billion in Realized Investment Income. \nThe $3.0 billion increase in Unrealized Investment Income was primarily attributable to net unrealized appreciation of investments in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Principal drivers were: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nAn increase of $1.2 billion in our Real Estate segment, primarily attributable to lower unrealized depreciation of Blackstone’s investment in certain Core+ real estate and BREP funds in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nAn increase of $975.8 million in our Private Equity segment, primarily attributable to higher unrealized appreciation of Blackstone’s investment in certain Corporate Private Equity funds in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Corporate Private Equity funds appreciated 16.6% in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 12.1% in the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nAn increase of $688.3 million in our Credit & Insurance segment, primarily attributable to higher unrealized gain on the ownership of Corebridge common stock based on the publicly traded price as of December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, and higher unrealized appreciation of Blackstone’s investment in certain mezzanine funds in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe $1.3 billion increase in Realized Investment Income was primarily attributable to higher realized gains in our Private Equity segment. \nExpenses \nExpenses were $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, compared to $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.7 billion in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which $1.3 billion was an increase in Performance Allocations Compensation. The increase in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily due to the increase in Investment Income, on which a portion of compensation is based. \nOther Income (Loss) \nOther Income (Loss) was $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $132.8 million, compared to $(84.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Other Income (Loss) was principally due to an increase of $146.9 million in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities. \nThe increase in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities was driven by an increase of $169.7 million in our Real Estate segment, partially offset by a decrease of $41.0 million in our Private Equity segment. The increase in our Real Estate segment was primarily driven by lower unrealized depreciation of investments and lower realized losses on investments in our consolidated funds. The decrease in our Private Equity segment was primarily due to the deconsolidation of a fund, partially offset by higher unrealized appreciation of investments in our consolidated funds. \n \n95 \nTable of Contents\n \nProvision for Taxes \nBlackstone’s Provision for Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $508.2 million, compared to $513.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.8% and 17.4% based on our Income Before Provision for Taxes of $6.5 billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe decrease in Blackstone’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, relates primarily to the impact of \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities and a decrease in Blackstone’s state tax provisions for the jurisdictions in which it operates. \nBlackstone had a corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) liability for the year ended December 31, 2024 as calculated pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act. Blackstone will continue to assess the overall impact to its Provision for Income Tax upon the issuance of applicable additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department related to interpretations of CAMT. For the year ended December 31, 2024 there is no meaningful CAMT impact reflected in the Provision for Income Taxes given current year tax payments made under CAMT are permitted to be carried forward and used as credits in future years resulting in a deferred tax benefit. \nAdditional information regarding our income taxes can be found in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 14. Income Taxes” of this filing. \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities \nThe Net Loss Attributable to Redeemable \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities and Net Income Attributable to \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities is attributable to the consolidated Blackstone Funds. The amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated Blackstone Funds and largely eliminate the amount of Other Income (Loss) — Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities from the Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc. \nNet Income Attributable to \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Blackstone Holdings is derived from the Income Before Provision for Taxes at the Blackstone Holdings level, excluding the Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities and the percentage allocation of the income between Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings and Blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to Blackstone. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Net Income Before Taxes allocated to Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings was 38.5% and 39.2%, respectively. The decrease of 0.7% was primarily due to the conversion of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock. \nThe Other Income (Loss) — Change in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability was entirely allocated to Blackstone Inc. \nOperating Metrics \nTotal and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management \nThe following graphs and tables summarize the Total Assets Under Management by Segment and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management by Segment, followed by a rollforward of activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact was $(3.5) billion, $(1.7) billion and $(5.9) billion for the Real Estate, Credit & Insurance and Total segments, respectively. \nEffective during the third quarter of 2024, the residential debt business was transferred from Real Estate to Credit & Insurance to align with a change in Blackstone’s management of those businesses. This organizational change resulted in a decrease (reflected as an outflow) for the year ended December 31, 2024 to Real Estate Total and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management and an increase (reflected as a contra-outflow) to Credit & Insurance Total and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management (the “Residential Debt Transfer”). These changes do not impact Blackstone’s Total or \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management or outflows in total. \nTotal Assets Under Management and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may have differences in the measurement and timing of certain activities that affect each of inflows, outflows, realizations and market activity. These differences include, but are not limited to: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor commitment-based drawdown funds, Total Assets Under Management inflows are generally reported at each fund closing whereas \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management inflows are generally reported when a fund’s investment period commences. Fund closings and the investment period commencement generally occur in different periods and as such, \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management inflows in such funds may exceed Total Assets Under Management inflows in the period when the investment period commences. This is most prevalent in our Real Estate and Private Equity segments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor commitment-based drawdown funds, Total Assets Under Management realizations generally represents the total proceeds whereas \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management generally represents only the invested capital. As such, Total Assets Under Management realizations typically exceeds \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management realizations. This is most prevalent in our Real Estate and Private Equity segments. \n \n100 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor commitment-based drawdown funds, Total Assets Under Management is reported based on invested capital at fair value and available capital whereas \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management is reported based on committed or remaining invested capital. As such, Total Assets Under Management market activity generally exceeds \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management market activity. This is most prevalent in our Real Estate and Private Equity segments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nFor certain credit funds, Total Assets Under Management are based on gross asset value while \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management are based on net asset value. As such, Total Assets Under Management inflows, outflows, realizations and market activity for the period generally exceed the \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management inflows, outflows, realizations and market activity for the period. \nTotal Assets Under Management \nTotal Assets Under Management were $1,127.2 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $87.0 billion compared to $1,040.2 billion at December 31, 2023.

December 31, 2024, a decrease of $127.5 million, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to decreases of $113.3 million in Fee Related Earnings and $14.2 million in Net Realizations. \nThe performance of funds in our Real Estate segment in 2024 was negatively impacted by volatility in the \n10-year\n Treasury yield, including a sharp increase in the fourth quarter, and a strong U.S. dollar. However, we believe a commercial real estate recovery is underway. Although the pace of such recovery is uncertain, the underpinnings are firmly in place, including a healthy economic backdrop that supports cash flow growth, meaningful improvements in the cost and availability of capital and a material decrease in construction starts. Subject to inflation subsiding, this should set the stage for a multi-year recovery. The constraints on future new supply, including in certain sectors in which our global opportunistic and Core+ real estate portfolios are concentrated, such as logistics and rental housing, should also support real estate values over time. \nWe additionally continue to believe that, despite recent speculation about data center demand, there will continue to be significant demand for digital infrastructure as artificial intelligence and other technological innovation is increasingly adopted and developed. Our Real Estate segment is well positioned to benefit from this trend. In certain markets and sectors with elevated near-term supply, including U.S. logistics and multifamily, however, growth has slowed and may moderate further. Life science office and traditional office valuations have also been negatively impacted by challenging sector dynamics and capital markets. While our NYSE-listed REIT, Blackstone Mortgage Trust (“BXMT”), is mostly focused in sectors with strong long-term fundamentals, its office exposure is higher than in our real estate equity business. Although this has posed challenges for the vehicle, its office exposure has been meaningfully reduced through loan resolutions and repayments. Given our conviction that a recovery is underway, our Real Estate funds deployed $25.3 billion in 2024, a nearly 70% increase year over year. While we expect our real estate realization activity to remain muted as commercial real estate continues to recover, we believe the market for realizations will strengthen over time. In BREIT, improving investor sentiment throughout 2024 has contributed to favorable trends in net flows, with a 97% decline in net repurchase requests in December 2024 relative to their peak in January 2023. \nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings were $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $113.3 million, compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $90.8 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues and an increase of $55.3 million in Other Operating Expenses, partially offset by an increase of $31.9 million in Management Fees, Net. \nFee Related Performance Revenues were $203.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $90.8 million, compared to $294.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower Fee Related Performance Revenues in BPP and \nco-investment\n and BXMT. \nOther Operating Expenses were $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $55.3 million, compared to $325.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher \nsub-servicing\n fees and professional fees. \nManagement Fees, Net were $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $31.9 million, compared to $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Transaction and Other Fees, Net, partially offset by a decrease in Base Management Fees. Transaction and Other Fees, Net increased $96.5 million primarily due to an increase in acquisition fees paid to the advisor of our BREP funds. Base Management Fees decreased $77.2 million primarily due to a decrease in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BREIT. \n \n116 \nTable of Contents\nNet Realizations \nNet Realizations were $114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $14.2 million, compared to $128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to a decrease of $43.4 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $22.3 million in Realized Performance Compensation. \nRealized Performance Revenues were $201.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $43.4 million, compared to $244.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower Realized Performance Revenues in BREP. \nRealized Performance Compensation was $101.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $22.3 million, compared to $123.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Realized Performance Revenues. \nFund Returns \nFund return information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

Return incorporates the closing NYSE stock price as of each period end. Inception to date returns are from May 22, 2013. \nFunds with Closed Investment Periods as of December 31, 2024 \nThe Real Estate segment has thirteen funds with closed investment periods as of December 31, 2024: BREP IX, BREP VIII, BREP VII, BREP VI, BREP V, BREP Europe VI, BREP Europe V, BREP Europe IV, BREP Europe III, BREP Asia II, BREP Asia I, BREDS IV and BREDS III. As of December 31, 2024, BREP VII, BREP VI, BREP V, BREP Europe VI, BREP Europe IV, BREP Europe III and BREP Asia I were above their carried interest thresholds (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would have been above their carried interest thresholds even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. BREP IX, BREP VIII, BREP Europe V, BREDS IV and BREDS III were above their carried interest thresholds as of December 31, 2024, and BREP Asia II was below its carried interest threshold. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds. \n \n118 \nTable of Contents\nPrivate Equity \nThe following table presents the results of operations for our Private Equity segment:

$744.9 million, compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to an increase of $769.5 million in Fee Related Earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $24.6 million in Net Realizations. \nOur Private Equity segment demonstrated resilience across all strategies in 2024. In addition to particular strength in Corporate Private Equity and Life Sciences, our Infrastructure business was a notable driver of Fee Related Performance Revenues in the fourth quarter due to a significant scheduled crystallization event. We continue to believe our Infrastructure business is well positioned to benefit from the expected increase in demand for investment in infrastructure, including digital infrastructure, over time. In Corporate Private Equity, our operating companies saw stable revenue growth and margin expansion during the year. Realization activity in the segment meaningfully increased toward the end of 2024, concentrated in Corporate Private Equity, and we see a more constructive environment for realizations in the segment through the course of 2025. Improved market sentiment has created positive momentum for deployment in the segment, which nearly doubled year-over-year, and for fundraising, including in our perpetual capital strategies. \nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings were $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $769.5 million, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $1.2 billion in Fee Related Performance Revenues and $190.7 million in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, partially offset by an increase of $544.6 million in Fee Related Compensation. \n \n119 \nTable of Contents\nFee Related Performance Revenues were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $1.2 billion, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to crystallization of performance revenues in BIP and BXPE. \nManagement and Advisory Fees, Net were $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $190.7 million, compared to $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by increases in Base Management Fees and Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net. Base Management Fees increased $123.9 million primarily due to an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BIP and BXPE, as well as the investment period commencement and subsequent fee holiday expirations of BCP IX and BETP IV. Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net increased $67.6 million primarily due to increased volume of deal activity in BXCM. \nFee Related Compensation were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $544.6 million, compared to $619.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Fee Related Performance Revenues and Management and Advisory Fees, Net, both of which impact Fee Related Compensation. \nNet Realizations \nNet Realizations were $811.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $24.6 million, compared to $835.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Net Realizations was attributable to an increase of $49.3 million in Realized Performance Compensation and a decrease of $23.9 million in Realized Principal Investment Income, partially offset by an increase of $48.6 million in Realized Performance Revenues. \nRealized Performance Compensation was $633.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $49.3 million, compared to $584.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Realized Performance Compensation in Corporate Private Equity and Tactical Opportunities, partially offset by decreases in Secondaries. \nRealized Principal Investment Income was $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $23.9 million, compared to $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in Realized Principal Investment Income in Corporate Private Equity. \nRealized Performance Revenues were $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $48.6 million, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Realized Performance Revenues in Tactical Opportunities and Corporate Private Equity, partially offset by decreases in Secondaries. \nFund Returns \nFund returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

Performance varies by vehicle and share class. Class I Total Net Return assumes reinvestment of any dividends received during the period, and no upfront selling commission, net of all fees and expenses incurred by the Class I shares. Class I Total Net Return is presented on an annualized basis from January 2, 2024. \nFunds With Closed Investment Periods as of December 31, 2024 \nThe Corporate Private Equity funds have eleven funds with closed investment periods: BCP IV, BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCP VIII, BCOM, BEP I, BEP II, BEP III, BCEP I and BCP Asia I. As of December 31, 2024, BCP IV was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. BCP V is comprised of two fund classes, the BCP V “main fund” and \nBCP V-AC\n fund. Within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCP VIII, BCOM, BEP I, BEP II, BEP III, BCEP I and BCP Asia I were above their respective carried interest thresholds. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds. \nTactical Opportunities funds have various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: \nBTOF-POOL,\n \nBTOF-POOL II,\n and \nBTOF-POOL III,\n which are each above their carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position. Blackstone Growth funds have no funds with closed investment periods. Secondaries funds have various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: Strategic Partners Infrastructure III, Strategic Partners VIII, Strategic Partners Real Estate VII and BSCH I which are above their respective carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position. Blackstone Life Sciences funds have one fund with a closed investment period: Clarus IV, which was above its carried interest threshold. \n \n122 \nTable of Contents\nCredit & Insurance \nThe

$275.4 million, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $251.4 million in Fee Related Earnings and $24.0 million in Net Realizations. \nOur Credit & Insurance segment demonstrated consistently strong performance in 2024. Longer-term structural shifts in the lending market have contributed to attractive and sizeable deployment opportunities in the segment, which invested $63.8 billion in 2024. Credit & Insurance funds have benefited from an environment of high interest rates, although these rates began to decrease in 2024. A further decline in interest rates and/or widening of credit spreads would make it more difficult for our credit funds to replicate recent strong performance. Nevertheless, even with modest base rate decreases, we continue to see significant opportunities to generate excess returns relative to liquid markets in our \nnon-investment\n grade strategies. Moreover, rapidly expanding private credit markets and opportunities for corporate and bank partnerships should continue to be supportive of overall transaction activity, including deployment. \nFundraising in our Credit & Insurance segment, including in our perpetual capital strategies, continued to be positively impacted by the long-term structural shifts in the lending market. In addition to strong interest in \nnon-investment\n grade strategies, such as opportunistic and direct lending, and a meaningful increase in demand for investment grade private credit, we see robust momentum in our perpetual capital strategies. At the same time, given the significant opportunities in the space, competition in the private credit markets has increased and is likely to increase further as a result of product innovation and customization by private credit managers. In addition, regulatory measures aimed at reducing burden on U.S. banks, such as less onerous bank regulatory capital requirements, may also increase competition. \n \n123 \nTable of Contents\nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $251.4 million, compared to $950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $243.8 million in Management Fees, Net and $182.8 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $127.6 million in Fee Related Compensation. \nManagement Fees, Net were $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $243.8 million, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Base Management Fees. Base Management Fees increased $264.2 million primarily due to an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in direct lending. \nFee Related Performance Revenues were $747.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $182.8 million, compared to $564.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher net investment income and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BCRED. \nFee Related Compensation was $755.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $127.6 million, compared to $628.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Management Fees, Net and Fee Related Performance Revenues, both of which impact Fee Related Compensation. \nNet Realizations \nNet Realizations were $223.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $24.0 million, compared to $199.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $18.1 million in Realized Principal Investment Income, partially offset by a decrease of $10.4 million in Realized Performance Compensation. \nRealized Principal Investment Income was $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $18.1 million, compared to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the impact of a realized loss related to the insurance platform in the year ended December 31, 2023. \nRealized Performance Compensation was $129.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $10.4 million, compared to $140.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Realized Performance Revenues. \nComposite Returns \nComposite returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

$192.2 million, compared to $315.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $25.1 million in Fee Related Earnings and $167.1 million in Net Realizations. \nNearly all strategies across our Multi-Asset Investing segment exhibited positive performance in 2024, with significantly less volatility than the broader markets. In particular, the Absolute Return Composite had its nineteenth consecutive quarter of positive performance and best year since 2009, benefiting from performance across strategies, including quantitative, macro and equities. Segment Distributable Earnings in the Multi-Asset Investing segment would likely be negatively impacted, however, by a significant or sustained weak market environment or decline in asset prices, including as a result of concerns over macroeconomic factors. In addition, certain of our strategies are designed to benefit from a high interest rate environment. Declining interest rates may make it more difficult for these Multi-Asset Investing strategies to replicate their positive performance. Conversely, if interest rates remain at sustained high levels for an extended period, certain investors may seek to reallocate capital away from traditional Multi-Asset Investing strategies in favor of fixed income investments. Outperformance by our Multi-Asset Investing segment strategies in a weak market environment has in some cases resulted in such strategies representing an increasing portion of the value of certain investors’ portfolios, which may limit such investors’ ability to allocate additional capital to certain funds in the segment, or result in such investors seeking to withdraw capital from such funds. \nFee Related Earnings \nFee Related Earnings were $228.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $25.1 million, compared to $203.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $20.0 million in Fee Related Compensation. \n \n126 \nTable of Contents\nFee Related Compensation was $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $20.0 million, compared to $164.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower compensation accruals. \nNet Realizations \nNet Realizations were $279.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $167.1 million, compared to $112.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $225.3 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $38.6 million in Realized Performance Compensation. \nRealized Performance Revenues were $380.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $225.3 million, compared to $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher Realized Performance Revenues in Absolute Return. \nRealized Performance Compensation was $86.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $38.6 million, compared to $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in Realized Performance Revenues. \nComposite Returns \nComposite returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. The composite returns information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of the financial performance of Blackstone and is also not necessarily indicative of the future results of any particular fund or composite.

The Absolute Return Composite includes only BXMA-managed commingled and customized multi-manager funds and accounts and does not include BXMA’s liquid solutions, seeding, Multi-Strategy, Harvest and advisory \n(non-discretionary)\n platforms, except for investments by Absolute Return funds directly into those platforms. BXMA-managed funds in liquidation and, in the case of net returns, \nnon-fee-paying\n assets are also excluded. The funds/accounts that comprise the Absolute Return Composite are not managed within a single fund or account and are managed with different mandates. There is no guarantee that BXMA would have made the same mix of investments in a stand-alone fund/account. The Absolute Return Composite is not an investible product and, as such, the performance of the Absolute Return Composite does not represent the performance of an actual fund or account.

Blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. As a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. We draw primarily on the long-term committed or invested capital of investors in our investment vehicles to fund the investment requirements of the Blackstone Funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to stockholders and distributions to holders of Holdings Units. \nFluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the Blackstone Funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes. The majority economic ownership interests of such consolidated Blackstone Funds are reflected as Redeemable \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities, and \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidation of these Blackstone Funds has no net effect on Blackstone’s Net Income or Equity. Additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in Blackstone investments in the \nnon-consolidated\n Blackstone Funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the \nnon-consolidated\n Blackstone Funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees. \n \n132 \nTable of Contents\nTotal Assets were $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $3.2 billion from December 31, 2023.

The increase in Total Liabilities was principally due to an increase of $2.6 billion in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships, partially offset by a decrease of $866.0 million in total liabilities attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to increases of $839.9 million in Accrued Compensation and Benefits, $837.5 million in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities and $616.5 million in Loans Payable. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\no\n\n\nThe increase in Accrued Compensation and Benefits was primarily due to an increase in compensation-related accruals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\no\n\n\nThe increase in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities was primarily due to an increase in derivative liabilities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\no\n\n\nThe increase in Loans Payable was primarily due to the issuance of senior notes during the quarter ended December 31, 2024. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nThe decrease in total liabilities attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds was primarily due to decreases of $599.6 million in Loans Payable and $322.4 million in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, which were primarily due to the deconsolidation of two CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nSources and Uses of Liquidity \nOn December 6, 2024, Blackstone, through its indirect subsidiary Blackstone Reg Finance Co. L.L.C., issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due December 6, 2034 pursuant to a Registration Statement on \nForm S-3.\n For additional information see Note 12. “Borrowings” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing and “— Notable Transactions”. \nWe have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes and other borrowings, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our $4.325 billion committed revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As of December 31, 2024, Blackstone had $2.0 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents, $1.1 billion invested in Corporate Treasury Investments and $5.8 billion in Other Investments (which included $5.3 billion of liquid investments), against $11.3 billion in borrowings from our bond issuances, and no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In February 2025, we drew $900.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. \n \n133 \nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the cash we receive from our notes offerings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and other borrowings, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) Performance Revenue realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. The amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. Our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. Therefore, Blackstone’s commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position. \nWe expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which includes, without limitation, funding our general partner and \nco-investment\n commitments to our funds and warehousing investments for our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, and other obligations as they arise, including servicing debts, (d) pay income taxes and (e) pay dividends to our stockholders, make distributions to the holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units and make repurchases under our share repurchase program.

expect our commitments to be drawn down over time and to be funded by available cash and cash generated from operations and realizations. Taking into account prevailing market conditions and both the liquidity and cash or liquid investment balances, we believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. Additionally, for some of the general partner commitments shown in the table above, we require our senior managing directors and certain other professionals to fund a portion of the commitment even though the ultimate obligation to fund the aggregate commitment is ours pursuant to the governing agreements of the respective funds. The amounts of the aggregate applicable general partner original and remaining commitment are shown in the table above. Remaining commitment may exceed original commitment due to recallable capital. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nIncludes the full portion of our commitments (1) required to be funded by senior managing directors and certain other professionals and (2) that are elected by such individuals to be funded for the life of a fund, where such fund permits such election. Excludes amounts that are elected by such individuals to be funded on an annual basis and certain de minimis commitments funded by such individuals in certain carry funds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nRepresents capital commitments to a number of other funds in each respective segment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nRepresents loan origination commitments, revolver commitments and capital market commitments. \nFor a tabular presentation of the timing of Blackstone’s remaining capital commitments to our funds, the funds we invest in and our investment strategies see “— Contractual Obligations”. \nBorrowings \nAs of December 31, 2024, Blackstone Holdings Finance Co.

The Notes contain customary covenants and financial restrictions that, among other things, limit the Issuers and the guarantors’ ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The Notes also contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the Notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the Notes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe Registered 2034 Notes’ Guarantors and Issuer, Blackstone Reg Finance Co.

(collectively, the “Obligor Group”) do not have material assets, liabilities and results of operations, with the exception of certain amounts already disclosed in our consolidated financial statements (specifically, goodwill, the majority of our deferred tax assets, the Tax Receivable Agreement liability and the Registered 2034 Notes). Therefore, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the Obligor Group due to management’s belief that such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide material information to investors.

Financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of \nfee-earning\n assets under management, each tested quarterly. \nFor a tabular presentation of the payment timing of principal and interest due on Blackstone’s issued notes and the Revolving Credit Facility see “— Contractual Obligations”. \nContractual Obligations \nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024 on a consolidated basis and on a basis deconsolidating the Blackstone Funds: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContractual Obligations\n\n\n  \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n2026-2027\n\n\n \n\n\n2028-2029\n\n\n \n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n\n\n\n\nOperating Lease Obligations (a)\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n180,493\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n367,948\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n380,512\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n919,296\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,848,249\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPurchase Obligations\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n126,174\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n148,459\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,991\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n976\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n295,600\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Operating Borrowings (b)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n318,843\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,538,876\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,285,330\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,217,700\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,360,749\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterest on Blackstone Operating Borrowings (c)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n422,762\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n825,184\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n714,130\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,368,535\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,330,611\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBorrowings of Consolidated Blackstone Funds\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n99,419\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n99,419\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterest on Borrowings of Consolidated Blackstone Funds\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15,662\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15,662\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45,356\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Funds Capital Commitments to Investee Funds (d)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n127,215\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n127,215\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDue to Certain \nNon-Controlling\n Interest Holders in Connection with Tax Receivable Agreements (e)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n43,954\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n205,716\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n252,970\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,342,197\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,844,837\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits, Including Interest and Penalties (f)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Operating Entities Capital Commitments to Blackstone Funds and Other (g)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n6,379,912\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,379,912\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Contractual Obligations\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n7,599,353\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,101,845\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,668,595\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,962,155\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27,331,948\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBorrowings of Consolidated Blackstone Funds\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(99,419\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(99,419\n\n\n) \n\n\n\n\nInterest on Borrowings of Consolidated Blackstone Funds\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(15,662\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(15,662\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(14,032\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(45,356\n\n\n) \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Funds Capital Commitments to Investee Funds (d)\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n(127,215\n\n\n) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(127,215\n\n\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlackstone Operating Entities Contractual Obligations\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,472,138\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,086,183\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,652,933\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n13,848,704\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n27,059,958\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nWe lease our primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2043. Occupancy lease agreements, in addition to contractual rent payments, generally include additional payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses and utilities. To the extent these are fixed or determinable they are included in the table above. The table above includes operating leases that are recognized as Operating Lease Liabilities, short-term leases that are not recorded as Operating Lease Liabilities and leases that have been signed but not yet commenced which are not recorded as Operating Lease Liabilities. The amounts in this table are presented net of contractual sublease commitments. \n \n139 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nRepresents the principal amounts due on our senior notes and secured borrowings. For our senior notes, we assume no \npre-payments\n and the borrowings are held until their final maturity. For our secured borrowings we project prepayments based on the performance of the underlying assets and principal may be paid down in full prior to their stated maturity. As of December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In February 2025, we drew $900.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nRepresents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes and secured borrowings. For our senior notes, we assume no \npre-payments\n and the borrowings are held until their final maturity. For our secured borrowings, we project \npre-payments\n based on the performance of the underlying assets with interest payments based on the estimated principal outstanding, inclusive of projected \npre-payments.\n These amounts include commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nThese obligations represent commitments of the consolidated Blackstone Funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nRepresents obligations by Blackstone’s corporate subsidiary to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements to certain \nnon-controlling\n interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of Blackstone’s IPO in 2007 and subsequent purchases. The obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings actually realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. As required by GAAP, the amount of the obligation included in the consolidated financial statements and shown in Note 17. “Related Party Transactions” (see “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain \nnon-controlling\n interest holders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nBlackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of $250.9 million and interest of $87.3 million as of December 31, 2024; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nThese obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the Blackstone Funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and Blackstone principal investment commitments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. We expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time. \nGuarantees \nBlackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. The amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in Note 18. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Guarantees” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \nIndemnifications \nIn many of its service contracts, Blackstone agrees to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the above contractual obligations table or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024. \n \n140 \nTable of Contents\n \nClawback Obligations \nPerformance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceed the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. The amounts and nature of Blackstone’s clawback obligations are described in Note 18. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Contingent Obligations (Clawback)” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \nShare Repurchase Program \nOn July 16, 2024, Blackstone’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. This authorization replaced Blackstone’s prior $2.0 billion repurchase authorization. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual number repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Blackstone repurchased 4.0 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $520.4 million. As of December 31, 2024, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $1.8 billion. \nDividends \nOur intention is to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of Blackstone Inc.’s share of Distributable Earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as \ntax-related\n payments, clawback obligations and dividends to stockholders for any ensuing quarter. The dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter. \nFor Blackstone’s definition of Distributable Earnings, see “—Key Financial Measures and Indicators.” \nAll of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely. \nBecause \nthe publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by Blackstone to common stockholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships to the Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships in respect of their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. \nDividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of Blackstone’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s basis. \nThe following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common stockholder dividends for 2024, 2023 and 2022. Dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned. \n \n141 \nTable of Contents\n\n\nWith respect to fiscal year 2024, we paid to stockholders of our common stock a dividend of $0.83, $0.82, $0.86 and $1.44 per share in respect of the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, aggregating to $3.95 per share of common stock. With respect to fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we paid stockholders of our common stock aggregate dividends of $3.35 per share and $4.40 per share, respectively. \nLeverage \nWe may under certain circumstances use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for Blackstone and our stockholders. In addition to the borrowings from our note issuances and our revolving credit facility, we may use asset based financing arrangements, including but not limited to, margin loans, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. Reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. Repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. The balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on Blackstone’s liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles. \nThe following table presents information regarding these financial instruments which are included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition: \n \n142 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nRepurchase\nAgreements\n\n\n  \n\n\nSecurities\nSold, Not Yet\nPurchased\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Dollars in Millions)\n\n\n\n\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Daily Balance\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n56.8\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMaximum Daily Balance\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n268.5\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n \nCritical Accounting Policies \nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. Actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. For a description of our accounting policies, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nFor a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Consolidation” and Note 8. “Variable Interest Entities” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for detailed information on Blackstone’s involvement with VIEs. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \nThe determination that Blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position included in this filing, we present 100% of the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs along with a \nnon-controlling\n interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle’s interests held by third parties. However, assets of our consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and are not available for general use by Blackstone. Further, the liabilities of our consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of Blackstone. In the Consolidated Statements of Operations, we eliminate any management fees, Incentive Fees, or Performance Allocations received or accrued from consolidated VIEs as they are considered intercompany transactions. We recognize 100% of the consolidated VIE’s investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third-party ownership to \nnon-controlling\n interests in arriving at Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc. \nThe assessment of whether we consolidate a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. These judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the VIE and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nDetermining whether our management fees, Incentive Fees or Performance Allocations represent variable interests — We make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. In making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third-party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the VIE. \n \n143 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nDetermining whether \nkick-out\n rights are substantive — We make judgments as to whether the third-party investors in a partnership entity have the ability to remove the general partner, the investment manager or its equivalent, or to dissolve (liquidate) the partnership entity, through a simple majority vote. This includes an evaluation of whether barriers to exercise these rights exist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\nConcluding whether Blackstone has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE — As there is no explicit threshold in GAAP to define “potentially significant,” management must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met. \nRevenue Recognition \nFor a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Revenue Recognition” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For an additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, Incentive Fees, and Performance Allocations are generated, please refer to “Part I. Item 1. Business — Fee Structure/Incentive Arrangements.” The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \nManagement and Advisory Fees, Net\n — Blackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base. The range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows: \nFor vehicles within the Real Estate segment: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.35% to 1.50% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period or subsequent to the investment period, respectively, for certain drawdown vehicles and \nco-investment\n vehicles, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.40% to 1.25% of net asset value for other vehicles, including separately managed accounts, certain perpetual capital vehicles, drawdown vehicles, and \nco-investment\n vehicles, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n1.50% of BXMT’s net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated “distributable earnings” (which is generally equal to its GAAP net income excluding certain \nnon-cash\n and other items), subject to certain adjustments. \nFor vehicles within the Private Equity segment: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.40% to 1.75% of committed capital during the investment period or invested capital or gross investment value subsequent to the investment period for drawdown vehicles and certain \nco-investment\n vehicles, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.50% to 1.75% of invested capital for separately managed accounts and certain \nco-investment\n vehicles, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.75% to 1.25% of net asset value for perpetual capital vehicles. \nFor vehicles within the Credit & Insurance segment: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.20% to 1.25% of net asset value or fair value of investments for certain separately managed accounts and open-ended vehicles, \n \n144 \nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.35% to 1.25% of net asset value or gross asset value of our BDCs and certain registered investment companies, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.20% to 0.50% of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for CLO vehicles, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.20% to 1.50% of invested capital for drawdown vehicles and certain separately managed accounts. \nFor vehicles within the Multi-Asset Investing segment: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n0.20% to 1.50% of net asset value for all vehicles. \nManagement fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value, gross asset value, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. See “ — Fair Value” below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments. \nInvestment Income (Loss)\n — Performance Allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. Blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle Blackstone to a Performance Allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the GAAP guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. Blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, Blackstone’s share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. Under the HLBV method, at the end of each reporting period Blackstone calculates the accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results. \nThe change in the fair value of the investments held by certain Blackstone Funds is a significant input into the accrued Performance Allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received Performance Allocations. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. See “ — Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments. \nFair Value \nBlackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. For a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Fair Value of Financial Instruments” and “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Investments, at Fair Value” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \nThe fair value of the investments held by Blackstone Funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, Incentive Fees, Performance Allocations and the related Compensation we recognize. Generally, Blackstone Funds are accounted for in accordance with the GAAP guidance on investment companies, and under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide, \nInvestment \n \n \n145 \nTable of Contents\n \nCompanies\n, and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments, at fair value. In the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. For investments where little market activity exists management’s determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for \nnon-performance\n and liquidity risks. \nBlackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables, investments in private debt securities and other proprietary investments. Blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives. \nFair Value of Investments or Instruments that are Publicly Traded \nSecurities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. When a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. In some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time. A discount to the publicly traded price may be appropriate in instances where a legal restriction is a characteristic of the security, such as may be required under SEC Rule 144. The amount of the discount, if taken, shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale. \nFair Value of Investments or Instruments that are not Publicly Traded \nInvestments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. Our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment’s projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. Our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is typically the market approach. The most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable. Depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, discount to sale, probability weighted methods or recent round of financing. \nIn certain cases debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. \n \n146 \nTable of Contents\nManagement Process on Fair Value \nDue to the importance of fair value throughout the consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. Investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are valued on at least a quarterly basis by our internal valuation or asset management teams, which are independent from our investment teams. For investments held by vehicles managed by more than one business unit, Blackstone has developed a process designed to facilitate coordination and alignment, as appropriate, of the fair value of \nin-scope\n investments across business units. \nFor investments valued utilizing the income method and where Blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the companies’ and underlying assets’ finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. The valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple or capitalization rate, and any other valuation input relevant to economic conditions. \nThe results of all valuations of investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are reviewed by the relevant business unit’s valuation \nsub-committee,\n which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. To further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. Our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. Each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our \nnon-employee\n directors. \nIncome Tax \nFor a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 14. “Income Taxes,” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing. \nOur provision for income taxes is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. \nAdditionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including any valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. In evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that Blackstone uses to manage its business. To the extent any portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. \nRevisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. \n \n147 \nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Developments \nInformation regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on Blackstone, if any, can be found in Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “ — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing.",
