(NYSE: IT) delivers actionable, objective insight that drives smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization’s mission-critical priorities.\nWe are a trusted advisor and an objective resource for close to 14,000 enterprises in approximately 90 countries and territories— across all major functions, in every industry and enterprise size.\nGartner delivers its products and services globally through three business segments – Research, Conferences and Consulting, as described below.\nResearch\n equips executives and their teams from every function and across all industries with actionable, objective insight, guidance and tools. Our experienced experts deliver all this value informed by a combination of practitioner-sourced and data-driven research to help our clients address their mission critical priorities.\nConferences\n provides executives and teams across an organization the opportunity to learn, share and network. From our Gartner Symposium/Xpo series, to industry-leading conferences focused on specific business roles and topics, to peer-driven sessions, our offerings enable attendees to experience the best of Gartner insight and guidance.\nConsulting\n serves senior executives leading technology-driven strategic initiatives leveraging the power of Gartner’s actionable, objective insight. Through custom analysis and on-the-ground support we enable optimized technology investments and stronger performance on our clients’ mission critical priorities.\nThe fiscal year of Gartner is the twelve-month period from January 1 through December 31. All references to 2024, 2023 and 2022 herein refer to the fiscal year unless otherwise indicated. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “Gartner,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nMARKET OVERVIEW\nEnterprise leaders face enormous pressure to stay ahead and grow profitably amidst constant change. Whether it is a digital transformation, cybersecurity risk mitigation, supply chain disruptions, large-scale regulatory changes, or other unique challenges, business leaders today are facing significant disruptive changes. We believe that enterprises cannot be operationally effective unless they incorporate the right strategy, management and technology decisions into every part of their business. This requirement affects all executives in every major function, enterprise size, geography, industry and market sector. Executives and their teams turn to Gartner for actionable, objective insight that drives smarter decisions and stronger performance on their mission-critical priorities.\nOUR SOLUTION\nWe believe our combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced and data-driven research steers clients toward the right decisions and actions on the issues that matter most. Organizations are overrun with data and information. Gartner helps eliminate this information chaos and provides clarity with actionable, objective insight. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our differentiated intellectual capital. The foundation of our business model is our ability to create and distribute our proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings and direct communications with executives and their teams; our conferences, including the Gartner Symposium/Xpo series; and consulting and advisory services. \nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nOur diversified business model provides multiple entry points and sources of value for our clients that lead to increased client spending on our research and advisory services, conferences and consulting services. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume and penetration with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and insight. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-\n3\nselling of our products and services. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services. \nOur principal products and services are delivered through our three business segments, as described below.\n•\nRESEARCH.\n Gartner delivers independent, objective insight to leaders across an enterprise through subscription services that include on-demand access to published research content, data and benchmarks, and direct access to a network of more than 2,500 research experts located around the globe. Gartner research is the fundamental building block for all Gartner products and services. We combine our proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and academic relationships to create Gartner products and services that address each role across an enterprise. Within the Research segment, Global Technology Sales (“GTS”) sells products and services to users and providers of technology, while Global Business Sales (“GBS”) sells products and services to all other functional leaders, such as human resources, supply chain, finance, and marketing.\nOur research agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. We are in steady contact with close to 14,000 distinct client enterprises worldwide. We publish tens of thousands of pages of original research annually, and our research experts had more than 505,000 direct client interactions in 2024. Our size and scale enable us to commit vast resources toward broader and deeper research coverage and to deliver insight to our clients based on what they need and where they are. The ongoing interaction of our research experts with our clients enables us to identify the most pertinent topics to them and develop relevant product and service enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users of our research. Our proprietary research content, presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered directly to the client’s computer or mobile device via our website and/or product-specific portals.\nClients normally sign subscription contracts that provide access to our research content and advisory services for individual users over a defined period. We typically have a minimum contract period of twelve months for our research and advisory subscription contracts and, at December 31, 2024, nearly 75% of our contracts were multi-year.\n•\nCONFERENCES.\n Gartner conferences are designed for information technology (\n“\nIT”) and business executives as well as other decision makers looking to adapt and evolve their organizations through disruption and uncertainty, navigate risks and prioritize investments. Attendees experience sessions led by Gartner research experts, and the sessions include cutting-edge technology solutions, peer exchange workshops, one-on-one analyst and advisor meetings, consulting diagnostic workshops, keynotes and more. Our conferences also provide attendees with an opportunity to interact with IT and business executives from the world’s leading companies. In addition to role-specific summits and workshop-style seminars, Gartner hosts the Gartner Symposium/Xpo series, including its unique, flagship IT Symposium/Xpo\n®\n, which is held at several locations worldwide annually. During 2024, Gartner successfully held 51 in-person conferences with more than 86,000 attendees, including nine Symposiums/Xpos. In addition, during 2024 we hosted 200+ peer networking meetings and 400+ exclusive local C-level meetings with more than 200 in-person.\n•\nCONSULTING.\n Through its experienced consultants, Gartner Consulting serves chief information officers and other senior executives who are driving technology-related strategic initiatives to optimize technology investments and drive business impact. Gartner Consulting combines the power of Gartner’s market-leading research with custom analysis and on-the-ground support to help clients to turn insight and advice into action and impact.\nConsulting solutions capitalize on Gartner assets that are invaluable to IT decision-making, including: (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our clients’ success; and (3) our market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons and best practices to assess and improve performance. Additionally, we provide actionable solutions for a range of IT-related priorities, including IT cost optimization, digital transformation and IT sourcing optimization.\nCOMPETITION\nWe believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are as follows:\n•\nSuperior research content - We believe that we create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research coverage across all major functional roles in an enterprise. Our independent operating model and research analysis generates \n4\nunbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality, independence and objectivity.\n•\nOur leading brand name - We have provided critical, trusted insight under the Gartner name for more than 40 years.\n•\nOur global footprint and established customer base - We have a global presence with clients in approximately 90 countries and territories on six continents. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the United States.\n•\nInsight that creates connections - Our global community of experts, analysts and peers help provide the deep relationships that help clients stay ahead of the curve.\n•\nExperienced management team - Our management team is comprised of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at Gartner.\n•\nSubstantial operating leverage in our business model - We can distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms, including research and advisory subscription and membership programs, conferences and consulting engagements, to derive incremental revenue and profitability.\n•\nVast network of research experts and consultants - As of December 31, 2024, we had more than 2,500 research experts and 960 experienced consultants located around the world. Our research experts are located in more than 30 countries and territories, enabling us to cover vast aspects of business and technology on a global basis.\nNotwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly with consulting firms and other data and information providers, including electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet. We anticipate encountering more competition with increased adoption of AI services in the markets in which we compete. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. While we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition, increased competition could result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing, and increased sales and marketing expenditures.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership, quote permission, and the use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property. We also enter into agreements with our employees and third parties as appropriate that protect our intellectual property, and we enforce these agreements if necessary. We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify, create and protect it. Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end users and we assert our rights in trademark and copyright law worldwide to protect our public content.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nWe believe our people are our most valuable asset, enabling our sustained track record of growth. From attracting top talent through our recruitment process, to cultivating that talent with learning and development opportunities and rewards for strong performers, to supporting overall wellness with meaningful benefits and engagement, we strive to put our people first. At December 31, 2024, we had 21,044 employees globally, 10,141 of which were outside of the U.S., and the overwhelming majority of our employees were full time.\nGartner is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all applicants and employees without regard to any legally protected status. This commitment is formalized in our global and U.S. equal employment opportunity policies. Our human capital management strategies are developed by executive management and overseen by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.\nCulture of Inclusion\n5\nWe are committed to operating with the highest ethical standards and fostering an environment that encourages open discussions and ensures our associates and clients are treated fairly and with respect. Our vision is to build a high-performing organization with a culture of inclusion, enabling Gartner to guide the leaders who shape the world.\nCurrently, 36% of our Board of Directors is female, and 27% of our Board of Directors identifies as racially or ethnically diverse. As of December 31, 2024, 21% of our executive management team is female, approximately 48% of our employees worldwide are female and 25% of employees in the U.S. identified as racially or ethnically diverse. Our employees work in 39 different countries and territories.\nWe work to integrate best-in-class inclusive approaches into all our talent processes and practices and prioritize efforts that support our world-class talent and their unique needs. Gartner’s dedication to inclusion is driven by our passionate leaders and associates around the world.\nOur eight associate-driven Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are open to all and help foster an inclusive and supportive workplace. ERGs play an important role in enabling associate success, cultivating a culture of inclusion and creating a sense of belonging for all our associates by supporting development, recognizing life stages, inspiring associates through storytelling and driving engagement through a sense of belonging. In 2024, over 6,500 Gartner associates were members of at least one ERG.\nTotal Rewards\nWe seek to invest in meaningful, innovative and inclusive compensation and benefit programs that support physical, financial and emotional well-being of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, 401(k) matching, healthcare and insurance benefits, and tax savings programs, such as health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, health savings account and pretax commuter benefits. We also offer generous paid time off, paid parental leave, life and disability insurance, business travel accident insurance, charity matching, tuition assistance and on-site amenities, such as fitness centers, among others.\nAdditionally, we provide a number of free mental and behavioral health resources for employees and their dependents, globally.  In 2024, we introduced an enhanced offering with proven on-demand self-care resources, as well as easy access to quality mental health coaches and therapists. We believe our total rewards programs facilitate associate retention and also encourage high performance.\nTalent Development, Retention and Training\nGartner aims to foster a culture of lifelong learning, getting feedback and evolving. In addition to helping employees unlock their full potential through mechanisms like continuous feedback and performance appraisals, we have dedicated programs designed to develop effective leaders. We also offer rotational programs and an online learning experience platform for employees called GartnerYou. In 2024, GartnerYou offered approximately 26,000 learning resources, with over 410,000 completions globally. Since our Sales and Research & Advisory teams make up approximately 45% of total employees worldwide, we also have formal, dedicated programs to help train and onboard new hires as well as more experienced managers and leaders within Sales and Research & Advisory. Through these programs, we believe our teams develop role-specific knowledge and skills, increase productivity and improve performance. \nWe also strive to develop an inclusive and engaging environment that makes Gartner a vibrant, exciting place to work. We believe the greatest catalyst to engagement comes from leadership — particularly their efforts to set direction, allocate resources, and build individual and organizational capability. We embed our associate survey efforts across the enterprise so that the insight we glean can help leaders at various levels understand the opportunities for effecting organizational growth. Survey results are used for a number of enterprise-wide and business-unit-specific initiatives targeting key areas of engagement and retention, such as leadership effectiveness, career development, business process improvement, and more. While associate turnover increased slightly in 2024 as compared with the prior year, average tenure increased slightly from approximately 5.0 years in 2023 to 5.3 years in 2024.\nOur Communities and the Environment\nOur associates have a long history of individual and team volunteering. Gartner facilitates a charity match program. In 2024, over 20% of associates supported approximately 4,500 causes through charitable donations or volunteering.  In total, more than $7.6 million was donated by Gartner and its associates and close to 19,600 hours were volunteered. We continue to embed sustainability in our operations in alignment with our near-term targets, which have been approved by the Science-Based \n6\nTargets Initiative. We also provide associates with learning opportunities, including a sustainability training module. Additionally, in 2024, over 1,000 associates were engaged in the Gartner Green Team, a voluntary, associate-driven group that enables associates to connect, learn, and drive change towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe encourage you to review our Corporate Responsibility Report located on our website at https://www.gartner.com/en/about/corporate-responsibility for more information.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n \nThe purpose of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is to facilitate an understanding of significant factors influencing the operating results, financial condition and cash flows of Gartner, Inc. Additionally, the MD&A conveys our expectations of the potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may impact future results. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for future periods. References to “Gartner,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this MD&A are to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThis MD&A\n \nprovides an analysis of our consolidated financial results, segment results and cash flows for 2024 and 2023 under the headings “Results of Operations,” “Segment Results” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\n \nFor a similar detailed \n18\ndiscussion comparing 2023 and 2022, refer to those headings under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn addition to GAAP results, we provide foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages for our revenues, certain expenses, contract values and other metrics. These foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and thus provide a more accurate and meaningful trend in the underlying data being measured. We calculate foreign currency neutral dollar amounts by converting the underlying amounts in local currency for different periods into U.S. dollars by applying the same foreign exchange rates to all periods presented.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nIn addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions, projections or strategies regarding the future. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “should,” “could,” “believe,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue” or other words of similar meaning.\nWe operate i\nn a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future quarterly and annual revenues, operating income, results of operations and cash flows, as well as any forward-looking statement, are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties, such as those disclosed or incorporated by reference in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Important factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in our forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: the impact of general economic conditions, including inflation (and related monetary policy by governments in response to inflation), on economic activity and our operations; changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including interest rates and the effect on the credit markets and access to capital; the impact of global economic and geopolitical conditions, including inflation, and recession; our ability to carry out our strategic initiatives and manage associated costs; the timing of conferences and meetings, in particular our Gartner Symposium/Xpo series that normally occurs during the fourth quarter; our ability to achieve and effectively manage growth, including our ability to integrate our acquisitions and consummate and integrate future acquisitions; our ability to pay our debt obligations; our ability to maintain and expand our products and services; our ability to expand or retain our customer base; our ability to grow or sustain revenue from individual customers; our ability to attract and retain a professional staff of research analysts and consultants as well as experienced sales personnel upon whom we are dependent, especially in light of labor competition; our ability to achieve continued customer renewals and achieve new contract value, backlog and deferred revenue growth in light of competitive pressures; our ability to successfully compete with existing competitors and potential new competitors; our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights; our ability to keep pace with technological developments in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and comply with evolving AI regulations; additional risks associated with international operations, including foreign currency fluctuations; the impact on our business resulting from changes in international conditions, including those resulting from the conflict in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine and current and future sanctions imposed by governments or other authorities; the impact of restructuring and other charges on our businesses and operations; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information systems; risks associated with the creditworthiness, budget cuts, and shutdown of governments and agencies; our ability to meet sustainability commitments and comply with applicable regulatory requirements; the impact of changes in tax policy (including global minimum tax legislation) and heightened scrutiny from various taxing authorities globally; changes to laws and regulations; and other risks and uncertainties. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. A description of the risk factors associated with our business is included under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks, estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those listed above or described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s opinion only as of the date on which they were made. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K speak only as of the date hereof, and forward-looking statements in documents attached that are incorporated by reference speak only \n19\nas of the date of those documents. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to review or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances as they occur.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nGartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT) delivers actionable, objective insight that drives smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization’s mission-critical priorities.\nWe are a trusted advisor and an objective resource for close to 14,000 enterprises in approximately 90 countries and territories — across all major functions, in every industry and enterprise size.\nGartner delivers its products and services globally through three business segments – Research, Conferences and Consulting, as described below.\n•\nResearch \nequips executives and their teams from every function and across all industries with actionable, objective insight, guidance and tools. Our experienced experts deliver all this value informed by a combination of practitioner-sourced and data-driven research to help our clients address their mission critical priorities.\n•\nConferences\n provides executives and teams across an organization the opportunity to learn, share and network. From our Gartner Symposium/Xpo series, to industry-leading conferences focused on specific business roles and topics, to peer-driven sessions, our offerings enable attendees to experience the best of Gartner insight and guidance.\n•\nConsulting \nserves senior executives leading technology-driven strategic initiatives leveraging the power of Gartner’s actionable, objective insight. Through custom analysis and on-the-ground support we enable optimized technology investments and stronger performance on our clients’ mission critical priorities.\nRecent Event\nOn July 25, 2024 the Company entered into a settlement agreement to resolve litigation concerning the Company's event cancellation insurance for 2020 and 2021. The settlement resolved all remaining 2020 and 2021 event cancellation insurance claims for $300.0 million.\n20\nBUSINESS MEASUREMENTS\nWe believe that the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments:\nBUSINESS SEGMENT\nBUSINESS MEASUREMENT\nResearch\nContract value\n represents the dollar value attributable to all of our subscription-related contracts. It is calculated as the annualized value of all contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Contract value primarily includes Research deliverables for which revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, as well as other deliverables (primarily Conferences tickets) for which revenue is recognized when the deliverable is utilized. Comparing contract value year-over-year not only measures the short-term growth of our business, but also signals the long-term health of our Research subscription business since it measures revenue that is highly likely to recur over a multi-year period. Our contract value consists of \nGlobal Technology Sales \ncontract value\n, \nwhich includes sales to users and providers of technology, and \nGlobal Business Sales \ncontract value\n, \nwhich includes sales to all other functional leaders.\nClient retention rate\n represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Client retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer.\nWallet retention rate\n represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by the contract value from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Wallet retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer.\nConferences\nNumber of destination conferences\n represents the total number of hosted in-person  conferences completed during the period. Single day, local meetings are excluded.\nNumber of destination conferences attendees\n represents the total number of people who attend in-person conferences. Single day, local meetings are excluded.\nConsulting\nConsulting backlog\n represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting and benchmark analytics engagements.\nUtilization rate\n represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill.\n \n21\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION\n \nThe fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating actionable insights for executive leaders and their teams, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness. \nWe had total revenues of $6.3 billion in 2024, an increase of 6% compared to 2023 on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. Net income increased to $1.3 billion in 2024 from $882.5 million in 2023 and diluted earnings per share was $16.00 in 2024 compared to $11.08 in 2023.\nResearch revenues increased to $5.1 billion in 2024, an increase of 5% compared to 2023 on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. The Research gross contribution margin was 74% in both 2024 and 2023. Contract value was $5.3 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of 8% compared to December 31, 2023 on a foreign currency neutral basis.\nConferences revenues increased to $583.2 million in 2024, an increase of 15% compared to 2023 on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. The Conferences gross contribution margin was 48% and 50% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. We held 51 and 47 in-person conferences in 2024 in 2023, respectively.\nConsulting revenues increased to $558.5 million in 2024, an increase of 9% compared to 2023 on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. The Consulting gross contribution margin was 36% and 35% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Backlog was $191.5 million at December 31, 2024.\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion during 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $0.7 billion of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. During 2024, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $0.7 billion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 — Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and, as such, they may ultimately differ materially from actual results. Ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.\nRevenue recognition\n — Our revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:\n•\nResearch revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. The related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs are recognized when the leads are provided to vendors.\n•\nConferences revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related conference or meeting.\n•\nConsulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee or time and materials engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized as we work to satisfy our performance obligations. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization engagements are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment.\n22\nThe majority of our Research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. Research contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. Generally, it is our policy to record the amount of a subscription contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.\nNote 1 — Business and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9 — Revenue and Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information regarding our revenues. \nAccounting for income taxes\n — We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, we consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized. We use estimates in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax law and measuring the benefits likely to be realized. Uncertain tax positions are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about their ultimate realization becomes available. In December 2024, we completed an intercompany transfer of certain intellectual property (IP). As a result, we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $163.2 million, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The deferred tax asset represents the value of future tax deductions for amortization of the assets in the acquiring jurisdiction. The fair value of the intellectual property was determined using an income approach based on unobservable inputs and involves significant judgments such as, but not limited to, future cash flows and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nAccounting for stock-based compensation\n — We account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 and No. 110. We recognize stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period. Note 10 — Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding stock-based compensation. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the use of certain subjective assumptions, including the expected life of a stock-based compensation award and our common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate periodic stock-based compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock-based compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if circumstances change and we deem it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions we made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of our stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period.\nA change in any of the terms or conditions of stock-based compensation awards is accounted for as a modification of the award. Incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the awards at the modification date. For vested awards, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested awards, we recognize any incremental compensation expense at the modification date or ratably over the requisite remaining service period, as appropriate. If the fair value of the modified award is lower than the fair value of the original award immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award.\n23\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results\nThe table below presents an analysis of selected line items and year-over-year changes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated (in thousands).\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nIncrease (Decrease)\nPercentage Increase\n(Decrease)\nTotal revenues\n$\n6,267,411 \n$\n5,906,956 \n$\n360,455 \n6 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\n \n \n \n \nCost of services and product development\n2,023,022 \n1,903,240 \n119,782 \n6 \nSelling, general and administrative\n2,884,814 \n2,701,542 \n183,272 \n7 \nDepreciation\n112,083 \n98,645 \n13,438 \n14 \nAmortization of intangibles\n90,232 \n92,458 \n(2,226)\n(2)\nAcquisition and integration charges\n973 \n9,587 \n(8,614)\n(90)\nGain from sale of divested operation\n— \n(135,410)\n135,410 \nnm\nOperating income\n1,156,287 \n1,236,894 \n(80,607)\n(7)\nInterest expense, net\n(69,488)\n(94,246)\n(24,758)\n(26)\nGain on event cancellation insurance claims\n300,000 \n3,077 \n296,923 \nnm\nOther income, net\n575 \n1,404 \n(829)\n(59)\nLess: Provision for income taxes\n133,659 \n264,663 \n(131,004)\n(49)\nNet income\n$\n1,253,715 \n$\n882,466 \n$\n371,249 \n42 \n%\nnm = not meaningful \nTotal revenues for 2024 were $6.3 billion, an increase of $360.5 million compared to 2023, or 6% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact.

The increase in Cost of services and product development was primarily due to a $82.8 million increase in personnel expenses associated with headcount and merit increases as well a $37.0 million increase in conference expenses due to an increase in the number of conferences. Cost of services and product development as a percent of revenues was 32% for both 2024 and 2023.\n24\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense was $2.9 billion in 2024, an increase of $183.3 million compared to 2023, or 7% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. The increase in SG&A during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of a $165.4 million increase in personnel expenses due to increased headcount and merit increases. \nThe number of quota-bearing sales associates in Global Technology Sales increased by 4% to 3,804 and in Global Business Sales increased by 9% to 1,298, compared to December 31, 2023. On a combined basis, the total number of quota-bearing sales associates increased by 6% when compared to December 31, 2023. SG&A expense as a percent of revenues was 46% during both 2024 and 2023.\nDepreciation increased by 14% during 2024 compared to 2023. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to increased software additions during the last twelve months.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased by 2% during 2024 compared to 2023.\nAcquisition and integration charges decreased by $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\nGain from sale of divested operation during the prior year was attributable to the sale of our TalentNeuron business in February 2023. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $135.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. \nOperating income was $1.16 billion and $1.24 billion during 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe \n7%\n decrease in operating income \nwas primarily due to the gain from sale of divested operation recognized during the prior year period, and increases in cost of services and product development and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased revenue. \nInterest expense, net decreased by $24.8 million during 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease in interest expense, net was due to increased interest income, primarily as a result of higher cash balances than the prior year. \nGain on event cancellation insurance claims of $300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 reflected proceeds from a settlement agreement to resolve litigation concerning the Company's event cancellation insurance for 2020 and 2021. The settlement resolved all remaining 2020 and 2021 event cancellation insurance claims. Gain on event cancellation insurance claims of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellation insurance claims. \nOther income, net for the years presented herein included the net impact of foreign currency gains and losses from our hedging activities, as well as sales of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives. During both 2024 and 2023, Other income, net included a $3.9 million gain on de-designated interest rate swaps.\nProvision for income taxes was $133.7 million and $264.7 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an effective income tax rate of 9.6% and 23.1% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2024 was primarily the result of net tax benefits of approximately $161.9 million recognized as a result of an intercompany transfer of certain intellectual property in December 2024. Note 12 — Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the Company’s income taxes. \nNet income was $1.3 billion and $882.5 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, our diluted net income per share increased by $4.92 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in net income during 2024 was primarily due to the gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as well as an increase in revenue and lower provision for income taxes and interest expense, net, partially offset by the gain from sale of divested operation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 and increased operating expenses. \nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income or loss excluding certain Cost of services and product development expenses, SG&A expenses, Depreciation, Amortization of intangibles, and Acquisition and integration charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percent of revenues.\n25\nReportable Segments\nThe sections below\n present the results of the Company’s three business segments – Research, Conferences and Consulting, as described below.\nResearch\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercentage\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nFinancial Measurements:\n \n \n \n \nRevenues (1)\n$\n5,125,650 \n$\n4,887,046 \n$\n238,604\n5 \n%\nGross contribution (1)\n$\n3,792,843 \n$\n3,600,143 \n$\n192,700\n5 \n%\nGross contribution margin\n74 \n%\n74 \n%\n— \n point\n— \nBusiness Measurements:\n \n \n \n \nContract Value (1), (3)\n$\n5,262,000 \n$\n4,880,000 \n$\n382,000\n8 \n%\nGlobal Technology Sales (2):\nContract value (1), (3)\n$\n4,029,000 \n$\n3,779,000 \n$\n250,000\n7 \n%\nClient retention \n84 \n%\n83 \n%\n1 \n point\n— \nWallet retention \n102 \n%\n101 \n%\n1 \n point\n— \nGlobal Business Sales (2):\nContract value (1), (3) \n$\n1,233,000 \n$\n1,101,000 \n$\n132,000\n12 \n%\nClient retention \n87 \n%\n87 \n%\n— \n point\n— \nWallet retention\n106 \n%\n107 \n%\n(1)\n point\n— \n(1)\nDollars in thousands.\n(2)\nGlobal Technology Sales includes sales to users and providers of technology. Global Business Sales includes sales to all other functional leaders.\n(3)\nContract values are on a foreign exchange neutral basis. Contract values as of December 31, 2023 have been calculated using the same foreign currency rates as 2024.\nResearch revenues increased by $238.6 million during 2024 compared to 2023, or 5% on both a reported basis excluding the foreign currency impact. The increase in revenues during 2024 was primarily due to Research contract value growth in 2023. The gross contribution margin was 74% in both 2024 and 2023, as the increase in revenue and decreased research program expenses were offset by an increase in personnel expenses to support future growth. \nContract value increased to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2024, or 8% compared to December 31, 2023 on a foreign currency neutral basis. All industry sectors grew at mid single-digit rates or faster, other than media. The fastest growth was in the manufacturing, healthcare and public sectors. Global Technology Sales (“GTS”) contract value increased by 7% at December 31, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in GTS contract value was primarily due to new business from existing clients. GTS contract value increased by at least mid single-digits for nearly all enterprise sizes and sectors. Global Business Sales (“GBS”) contract value increased by 12% year-over-year, also primarily driven by new business from existing clients. The majority of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates, with all enterprise sizes and the majority of sectors also growing double-digits year-over-year.\nGTS client retention was 84% and 83% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, while wallet retention was 102% and 101%, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. GBS client retention was 87% as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, while wallet retention was 106% and 107% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n26\nConferences\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercentage\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nFinancial Measurements:\n \n \n \nRevenues (1)\n$\n583,224 \n$\n505,164 \n$\n78,060\n15 \n%\nGross contribution (1)\n$\n281,409 \n$\n253,739 \n$\n27,670\n11 \n%\nGross contribution margin\n48 \n%\n50 \n%\n(2)\n points\n— \nBusiness Measurements:\n \n \n \n \nNumber of destination conferences (2)\n51\n47\n4\n9 \n%\nNumber of destination conferences attendees (2) \n86,625\n75,569\n11,056\n15 \n%\n(1)\nDollars in thousands.\n(2)\nSingle day, local meetings are excluded.\nConferences revenues increased by $78.1 million during 2024 compared to 2023, or 15% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. We held 51 in-person destination conferences during the year ended December 31, 2024. We held 47 in-person conferences during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 was due to an increase of 15% in both exhibitor revenue and attendee revenue compared to the same period in 2023. The segment gross contribution margin was 48% and 50% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower gross contribution margin during 2024 was primarily the result of an increase in conference-related expenses and increased headcount partially offset by the increase in revenue.\nConsulting\n \nAs Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2024\nAs Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercentage\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nFinancial Measurements:\n \n \n \n \nRevenues (1)\n$\n558,537 \n$\n514,746 \n$\n43,791\n9 \n%\nGross contribution (1)\n$\n203,292 \n$\n181,501 \n$\n21,791\n12 \n%\nGross contribution margin\n36 \n%\n35 \n%\n1 \n point\n— \nBusiness Measurements:\n \n \n \n \nBacklog (1), (2)\n$\n191,500 \n$\n163,000 \n$\n28,500\n17 \n%\nAverage billable headcount\n956\n934\n22\n2 \n%\nConsultant utilization\n65 \n%\n65 \n%\n— \npoint\n— \n(1)\nDollars in thousands.\n(2)\nBacklog is on a foreign currency neutral basis. Backlog as of December 31, 2023 has been calculated using the same foreign currency rates as 2024. \nConsulting revenues increased 9% during 2024 compared to 2023 on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. The increase in revenues on a reported basis was due to a 5% increase in labor-based consulting, and a 21% increase in contract optimization. Contract optimization revenue may vary significantly and, as such, 2024 revenues may not be indicative of future results. The segment gross contribution margin was 36% and 35% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in gross contribution margin during 2024 was primarily due to the increase in revenue.\nBacklog increased by $28.5 million, or 17%, from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe finance our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings. Note 6 — Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the Company’s outstanding debt obligations. At December 31, 2024, we had $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $0.7 billion of available borrowing \n27\ncapacity on the revolving credit facility under our 2024 Credit Agreement. We believe that the Company has adequate liquidity and access to capital markets to meet its currently anticipated needs for both the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.\nWe have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities, benefiting from the favorable working capital dynamics of our subscription-based business model in our Research segment, which is our largest business segment and historically has constituted a significant portion of our total revenues. The majority of our Research customer contracts are paid in advance and, combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, our subscription-based business model has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow. Cash flow generation has also benefited from our ongoing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase sales.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into an amended lease agreement to significantly reduce the square footage and reduce future lease payments at one of our leased locations. We made an installment payment of $24.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2024, and will make an equal installment payment during the second quarter of 2025 in consideration for the lease amendment. \nOur cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with 43% held overseas at December 31, 2024. We intend to distribute a portion of the accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 in conjunction with global restructuring activity. We continue to assert our intention to reinvest substantially all remaining accumulated undistributed foreign earnings, except in instances where repatriation would result in minimal additional tax.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in the Company’s cash balances for the years indicated (in thousands).\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n \n2024\n2023\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,484,922 \n$\n1,155,737 \n$\n329,185 \nCash (used in) provided by investing activities\n(103,737)\n54,157 \n(157,894)\nCash used in financing activities\n(710,143)\n(588,881)\n(121,262)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n671,042 \n621,013 \n50,029 \nEffects of exchange rates \n(57,494)\n(13)\n(57,481)\nBeginning cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n1,319,599 \n698,599 \n621,000 \nEnding cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n1,933,147 \n$\n1,319,599 \n$\n613,548 \nOperating\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the $300.0 million of insurance proceeds received during 2024 as well as reduced net cash interest expense and increased operating income, excluding the 2023 gain from sale of divested operation.\nInvesting\nCash (used in) provided by investing activities was $(103.7) million and $54.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease from 2023 to 2024 was primarily the result of the $161.1 million in proceeds received from the sale of our TalentNeuron business in February 2023.\nFinancing\nCash used in financing activities was $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the 2024 period, we used $0.7 billion of cash for share repurchases. In March 2024, we borrowed $274.4 million under the 2024 Credit Agreement. The initial borrowing was used to repay the outstanding amounts under the 2020 Credit Agreement. During the 2023 period, we used $0.6 billion for share repurchases and paid a net $7.8 million in debt principal repayments. \nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nDebt\n28\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $2.5 billion of principal amount of debt outstanding. Note 6 — Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the Company’s outstanding debt obligations. From time to time, the Company may seek to retire or repurchase its outstanding debt through various methods including open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, or otherwise, all or some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Such transactions, if any, depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors, and may involve material amounts.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough December 31, 2024, the Company has not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.\nContractual Cash Commitments\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s future contractual cash commitments as of December 31, 2024 (in thousands).\nCommitment Description\nDue In Less Than\n1 Year\nDue In 2-3\nYears\nDue In 4-5\nYears\nDue In More Than\n5 Years\nTotal\nDebt – principal, interest, and commitment fees (1)\n$\n105,055 \n$\n213,326 \n$\n1,827,149 \n$\n830,001 \n$\n2,975,531 \nOperating leases (2)\n122,111 \n197,949 \n85,313 \n130,261 \n535,634 \nDeferred compensation arrangements (3)\n12,876 \n20,595 \n14,490 \n100,603 \n148,564 \nOther (4)\n52,748 \n117,091 \n215,058 \n61,296 \n446,193 \nTotals\n$\n292,790 \n$\n548,961 \n$\n2,142,010 \n$\n1,122,161 \n$\n4,105,922 \n(1)\nPrincipal repayments of the Company’s debt obligations were classified in the above table based on the contractual repayment dates. Interest payments were based on the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2024. Commitment fees were based on unused balances and commitment rates as of December 31, 2024. Note 6 — Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides information regarding the Company’s debt obligations and interest rate swap contracts.\n(2)\nThe Company leases various facilities, automobiles, computer equipment and other assets under non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring between 2025 and 2038. The total commitment excludes approximately $145.5 million of estimated future cash receipts from the Company’s subleasing arrangements. Note 1 — Business and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7 — Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information regarding the Company’s leases.\n(3)\nThe Company has supplemental deferred compensation arrangements with certain of its employees. Amounts payable with known payment dates have been classified in the above table based on those scheduled payment dates. Amounts payable whose payment dates are unknown have been included in the Due In More Than 5 Years category because the Company cannot determine when the amounts will be paid. Note 15 — Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the Company’s supplemental deferred compensation arrangements.\n(4)\nOther includes: (i) contractual commitments (a) for software, telecom and other services and (b) to secure sites for our Conferences business; and (ii) projected cash contributions to the Company’s defined benefit pension plans. Note 15 — Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the Company’s defined benefit pension plans.\nIn addition to the contractual cash commitments included in the above table, the Company has other payables and liabilities that may be legally enforceable but are not considered contractual commitments. Information regarding the Company’s payables and liabilities is included in Note 5 — Accounts Payable and Accrued and Other Liabilities and Note 12 — Income Taxes\n \nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe FASB has issued accounting standards that had not yet become effective as of December 31, 2024 and may impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements or its disclosures in future periods.
