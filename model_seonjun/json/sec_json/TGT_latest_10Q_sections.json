Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFinancial Summary \nThird quarter 2025 included the following notable items:\n•\nGAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.51 and Adjusted EPS\n1\n were $1.78.\n•\nNet Sales were $25.3 billion, a decrease of 1.5 percent from the comparable prior-year period.\n•\nComparable sales decreased 2.7 percent, reflecting a 2.2 percent decrease in traffic and a 0.5 percent decrease in average transaction amount.\n◦\nComparable stores-originated sales declined 3.8 percent.\n◦\nComparable digitally-originated sales increased 2.4 percent.\n•\nOperating income of $0.9 billion was 18.9 percent lower than the comparable prior-year period.\nEarnings Per Share\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nChange\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nChange\nGAAP diluted earnings per share\n$\n1.51 \n$\n1.85 \n(18.2)\n%\n$\n5.84 \n$\n6.45 \n(9.6)\n%\nAdjustments\n0.26 \n— \n(0.71)\n— \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$\n1.78 \n$\n1.85 \n(3.9)\n%\n$\n5.13 \n$\n6.45 \n(20.5)\n%\nNote: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.\n1\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provid\ned \non \npage 22\n.\nWe report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of our capital allocation effectiveness over time. For the trailing twelve months ended November 1, 2025, after-tax ROIC \nwas \n13.4 percent\n,\n compared with 15.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended November 2, 2024. The calculation of ROIC is \nprovided on\n \npage 23\n. \nBusiness Environment\nIn April 2025, the U.S. imposed a range of tariffs on the vast majority of products manufactured in foreign countries and jurisdictions, and subsequently imposed incremental tariffs, paused, modified, or issued specific exceptions to recently imposed tariffs. The U.S. has indicated that it is actively negotiating or expects to negotiate country-specific agreements that it expects will result in changes to imposed tariff rates. Approximately one-half of the merchandise we offer is sourced from outside the U.S., either directly or through our vendors, with China as the single largest source of merchandise we import.\nWe are closely monitoring the evolving consumer and regulatory landscape and adjusting plans as needed. The collective interaction of tariffs, sourcing strategies, pricing actions, consumer response and behaviors, and other factors, could materially impact our sales and results of operations in future periods. \nBusiness Transformation Initiatives\nIn May 2025, we announced a multi-year initiative to transform various aspects of our business—including our organizational structure, processes, and technology—to enable greater agility and optimize the use of the Company's assets. The three months ended November 1, 2025, included costs and charges related to our business transformation initiatives, including a reduction in our headquarters workforce. \nNote 4\n to the Financial Statements provides additional information.\nWe may incur additional business transformation costs and charges in future periods, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition; however, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such costs and charges at this time.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n15\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTable of Contents\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIndex to Notes\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nSummary of Operating Income \nThree Months Ended\n \nNine Months Ended\n \n(dollars in millions)\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nChange\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n25,270 \n$\n25,668 \n(1.5)\n%\n$\n74,327 \n$\n75,651 \n(1.7)\n%\nCost of sales \n(a)\n18,137 \n18,402 \n(1.4)\n53,168 \n53,700 \n(1.0)\nSG&A expenses \n(a)(b) \n5,536 \n5,459 \n1.4 \n15,486 \n15,969 \n(3.0)\nDepreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales)\n649 \n639 \n1.7 \n1,936 \n1,883 \n2.8 \nOperating income \n(b)\n$\n948 \n$\n1,168 \n(18.9)\n%\n$\n3,737 \n$\n4,099 \n(8.8)\n%\nRate Analysis\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nGross margin rate \n(a)\n28.2 \n%\n28.3 \n%\n28.5 \n%\n29.0 \n%\nSG&A expense rate \n(a)(b)\n21.9 \n21.3 \n20.8 \n21.1 \nDepreciation and amortization expense rate (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales)\n2.6 \n2.5 \n2.6 \n2.5 \nOperating income margin rate \n(b)\n3.8 \n4.6 \n5.0 \n5.4 \n(a)\nReflects the impact of a reclassification of prior year amounts, which were not material, to conform with current year presentation.\n(b)\nSG&A Expenses and Operating Income for the three and nine months ended November 1, 2025, include certain business transformation costs described in \nNote 4\n to the Financial Statements. For the nine months ended November 1, 2025, SG&A Expenses and Operating Income also include gains related to interchange fee settlements described in \nNote 3\n. These discretely managed items resulted in a net impact to the SG&A Expense Rate of 0.6 and (0.6) percentage points for the three and nine months ended November 1, 2025, respectively, with an inverse impact on the Operating Income Margin Rate in the respective periods. The \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS\n tables provide additional information. \nNote: Gross margin (GM) is calculated as Net Sales less Cost of Sales. All rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by Net Sales. We updated the prior period gross margin rate to conform to the current year calculation, which resulted in an approximate 1 percentage point increase in our gross margin rate for the 2024 periods presented.\nNet Sales\nNet sales includes all Merchandise Sales and revenues from other sources, most notably advertising revenue and credit card profit-sharing income. \nMerchandise Sales are net of expected returns, and our estimate of gift card breakage. Comparable sales include all Merchandise Sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months or that have been closed. We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channels by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all Merchandise Sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pickup or Drive Up, and Same Day Delivery. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n16\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTable of Contents\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIndex to Notes\nMerchandise Sales growth—from both comparable sales and new stores—represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable sales growth will drive a significant portion of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests’ shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and other factors will over the long-term drive both increasing shopping frequency (number of transactions, or \"traffic\") and the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).\nComparable Sales\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nComparable sales change\n(2.7)\n%\n0.3 \n%\n(2.8)\n%\n(0.5)\n%\nDrivers of change in comparable sales\n \n \n \n \nNumber of transactions (traffic)\n(2.2)\n2.4 \n(1.9)\n1.1 \nAverage transaction amount\n(0.5)\n(2.0)\n(0.9)\n(1.6)\nComparable Sales by Channel\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nStores originated comparable sales change\n(3.8)\n%\n(1.9)\n%\n(4.2)\n%\n(2.0)\n%\nDigitally originated comparable sales change\n2.4 \n10.8 \n3.8 \n6.9 \nMerchandise Sales by Channel\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nStores originated\n80.7 \n%\n81.5 \n%\n80.7 \n%\n81.8 \n%\nDigitally originated\n19.3 \n18.5 \n19.3 \n18.2 \nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nMerchandise Sales by Fulfillment Channel\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nStores \n97.7 \n%\n97.7 \n%\n97.7 \n%\n97.8 \n%\nOther\n2.3 \n2.3 \n2.3 \n2.2 \nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nNote: Merchandise Sales fulfilled by stores include in-store purchases and digitally originated sales fulfilled by shipping merchandise from stores to guests, Order Pickup, Drive Up, and Same Day Delivery.\nMerchandise Sales by Product Category\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nApparel & accessories\n16 \n%\n16 \n%\n16 \n%\n16 \n%\nBeauty\n13 \n13 \n13 \n13 \nFood & beverage\n24 \n23 \n24 \n23 \nHardlines\n13 \n12 \n14 \n13 \nHome furnishings & décor\n16 \n17 \n15 \n16 \nHousehold essentials\n18 \n19 \n18 \n19 \nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n17\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTable of Contents\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIndex to Notes\nNote 2\n to the Financial Statements provides additional product category sales information. The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive, and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix and the transfer of sales to new stores, makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible. \nWe monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using Target Circle™ Cards (Target Circle Card Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our Target Circle Cards are also incremental sales for Target. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a Target Circle Card at Target. For the three months ended November 1, 2025, and November 2, 2024, total Target Circle Card Penetration was 16.9 percent and 17.7 percent, respectively. For the nine months ended November 1, 2025, and November 2, 2024, total Target Circle Card Penetration was 17.0 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively. \nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n18\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTable of Contents\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIndex to Notes\nGross Margin Rate\nQuarter-to-Date\nFor the three months ended November 1, 2025, our gross margin rate was 28.2 percent compared with 28.3 percent in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease reflected the net impact of \n•\nmerchandising, primarily due to higher markdown rates partially offset by growth in advertising and other revenues; \n•\nlower inventory shrink; and\n•\nlower supply chain and digital fulfillment costs, reflecting the comparison over costs in 2024 related to timing of receipts and elevated inventory, combined with the benefit of productivity improvements at supply chain facilities and in digital fulfillment, partially offset by the deleveraging impact of lower sales.\nYear-to-Date\nFor the nine months ended November 1, 2025, our gross margin rate was 28.5 percent compared with 29.0 percent in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease reflected the net impact of \n•\nmerchandising activities, including higher markdown rates and purchase order cancellation costs, partially offset by growth in advertising and other revenues; \n•\nhigher supply chain and digital fulfillment costs, partially due to the combined impact of investments in new supply chain facilities and the deleveraging impact of lower sales; and \n•\nlower inventory shrink.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n19\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTable of Contents\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIndex to Notes\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense Rate\nFor the three months ended November 1, 2025, our SG&A expense rate was 21.9 percent compared with 21.3 percent for the comparable prior-year period. The increase reflected business transformation costs of approximately 0.6 percentage points. The deleveraging impact of lower Net Sales was offset by a reduction in other costs, including lower incentive compensation expense. \nFor the nine months ended November 1, 2025, our SG&A expense rate was 20.8 percent compared with 21.1 percent for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease reflected a favorable impact of interchange fee settlements during the first quarter of 2025 of approximately 0.8 percentage points. This rate benefit was partially offset by the deleveraging impact of lower Net Sales, and the net impact of other costs, including 0.2 percentage points related to business transformation costs. \nInterchange fee settlements and business transformation costs are further described in \nNotes \n3\n and \n4\n, respectively, to the Financial Statements.\nStore Data\nChange in Number of Stores\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nBeginning store count\n1,982 \n1,966 \n1,978 \n1,956 \nOpened\n14 \n13 \n18 \n23 \nClosed\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nEnding store count\n1,995 \n1,978 \n1,995 \n1,978 \nNumber of Stores and\nNumber of Stores\nRetail Square Feet\n \n(a)\nRetail Square Feet\nNovember 1, 2025\nFebruary 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\nNovember 1, 2025\nFebruary 1, 2025\nNovember 2, 2024\n170,000 or more sq. ft.\n273 \n273 \n273 \n48,824 \n48,824 \n48,824 \n50,000 to 169,999 sq. ft.\n1,576 \n1,559 \n1,559 \n197,274 \n195,050 \n195,050 \n49,999 or less sq. ft.\n146 \n146 \n146 \n4,420 \n4,404 \n4,404 \nTotal\n1,995 \n1,978 \n1,978 \n250,518 \n248,278 \n248,278 \n(a)\nIn thousands; reflects total square feet less office, supply chain facility, and vacant space.\n \nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n20\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTable of Contents\nOTHER PERFORMANCE FACTORS\nIndex to Notes\nOther Performance Factors\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense was \n$115 million and $346 million f\nor the three and nine months ended \nNovember 1, 2025, respectively, compared with $105 million and $321 million in the comparable prior-year periods.

For the three month period, the decrease primarily reflects benefits from tax credits in the current year. For the nine month period, the increase reflects discrete tax expense in the current year related to share-based compensation and global minimum taxes, partially offset by benefits from tax credits.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n21\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTable of Contents\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIndex to Notes\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures\nTo provide additional transparency, we disclose non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS).

Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of $2.9 billion, $3.9 billion, and $2.5 billion as of November 1, 2025, February 1, 2025, and November 2, 2024, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly-rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.\nOperating Cash Flows\n \nCash flows provided by operating activities were $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion for the nine months ended November 1, 2025, and November 2, 2024, respectively. The decrease reflects lower net earnings, as well as the net impact of lower accounts payable leverage and inventory purchases in the current year.\n \nInventory\nInventory was $14.9 billion as of November 1, 2025, compared with $12.7 billion and $15.2 billion as of February 1, 2025, and November 2, 2024, respectively. The increase from February 1, 2025, primarily reflects the seasonal inventory build ahead of the November and December holiday sales period. The decrease compared to November 2, 2024, reflects alignment of inventory with sales trends, partially offset by higher merchandise costs.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nCash required for investing activities increased to $2.8 billion for the nine months ended November 1, 2025, compared to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, due to higher capital expenditures.\nDividends\n \nWe paid dividends totaling $518 million ($1.14 per share) and $1.5 billion ($3.38 per share) for the three and nine months ended November 1, 2025, respectively, and $516 million ($1.12 per share) and $1.5 billion ($3.32 per share) for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, respectively, a per share increase of 1.8 percent. We declared dividends totaling $526 million ($1.14 per share) during the third quarter of 2025 and $521 million ($1.12 per share) during the third quarter of 2024, a per share increase of 1.8 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.\nShare Repurchase\nWe deployed $403 million to repurchase shares during the nine months ended November 1, 2025. See \nPart II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and \nNote 10\n to the Financial Statements for more information.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n24\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTable of Contents\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nIndex to Notes\nFinancing\nOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of November 1, 2025, our credit ratings were as follows:\nCredit Ratings\nMoody’s\nS&P\nFitch\nLong-term debt\nA2\nA\nA\nCommercial paper\nP-1\nA-1\nF1\nIf our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. \nWe issued $1.0 billion of unsecured debt in both March and June 2025, and repaid $1.5 billion of unsecured debt in April 2025.\n \nNote 8\n to the Financial Statements provides additional information.\nWe have the ability to obtain short-term financing from time to time under our commercial paper program and credit facilities. In October 2025, we obtained a new committed $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2026 and terminated our prior 364-day credit facility. This credit facility and our $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2028 provide a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2025 or 2024. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of either November 1, 2025, or November 2, 2024. \nNote 8\n to the Financial Statements provides additional information. \nMost of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facilities also contain a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, as of November 1, 2025, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.\nWe believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, working capital, and planned capital expenditures, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nQ3 2025 Form 10-Q\n25\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS & SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nTable of Contents\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS & CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nIndex to Notes\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations.
