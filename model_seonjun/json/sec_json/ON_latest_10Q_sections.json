The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased third-party acquisition-related costs.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOther Operating Expenses\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was \n$33.6 million\n and \n$38.5 million\n for the nine months ended October 3, 2025 and September 27, 2024, respectively, representing a decrease of $4.9 million, or approximately 13%.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net\nRestructuring, asset impairments and other, net was \n$608.1 million\n for the nine months ended October 3, 2025, as compared to \n$103.0 million\n for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, representing an increase of $505.1 million. Charges incurred for the nine months ended October 3, 2025 primarily relate to restructuring actions during the period. See Note 5: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net'' in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $6.6 million to \n$53.6 million\n during the nine months ended October 3, 2025, as compared to \n$47.0 million\n during the nine months ended September 27, 2024. Our average gross long-term debt balance for the nine months ended October 3, 2025 was $3,379.9 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.1%, as compared to $3,379.9 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.9% for the nine months ended September 27, 2024. \nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased by $9.1 million, or approximately 11%, to \n$74.5 million\n during the nine months ended October 3, 2025 compared to \n$83.6 million\n during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 primarily attributable to lower interest rates on short-term investments.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income was \n$9.2 million\n for the nine months ended October 3, 2025 as compared to other expense of \n$0.8 million\n for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, primarily driven by higher dividend income.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of \n$27.6 million\n and income tax provision of \n$200.1 million\n during the nine months ended October 3, 2025 and September 27, 2024, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 32.2% and 14.3%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the quarter was primarily driven by a return-to-provision adjustment recorded upon finalizing the U.S. federal income tax return, which resulted in a discrete tax benefit.\nFor additional information, see Note 13: ''Income Taxes'' in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, short-term investments, cash generated from operations, available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility as well as new debt and/or equity issuances. In the near term, we expect to fund our cash requirements by utilizing any or a combination of these principal sources. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately $2.9 billion as of October 3, 2025, and the Revolving Credit Facility has approximately $1.1 billion available for future borrowings.\nWe require cash to: (i) fund our operating expenses, working capital requirements, outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments; (ii) service our debt, including principal and interest; (iii) incur capital expenditures; and (iv) repurchase our common stock. During the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. Our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing equipment. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted.\n38\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that our cash on hand, cash generated from our operations and the amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility are adequate to meet our working capital requirements and other business needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities were $1,205.3 million and $1,326.7 million for the nine months ended October 3, 2025 and September 27, 2024, respectively. The decrease in net income was driven by lower end-market demand for our products and by the non-cash asset impairment and other restructuring-related charges incurred during the nine months ended October 3, 2025. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities of $121.4 million was driven by the timing of cash receipts and payments related to working capital balances.\nOur ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets. Management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows used in investing activities were $487.8 million and $858.1 million for the nine months ended October 3, 2025 and September 27, 2024, respectively. The decrease of $370.3 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures partially offset by the payments for acquisition of a business during the nine months ended October 3, 2025. Our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue through Q3 were approximately 6%, and we expect capital expenditures in the range of \n5 \n- 6% of revenue for 2025. \nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows used in financing activities were $939.9 million and $480.5 million for the nine months ended October 3, 2025 and September 27, 2024, respectively. The increase of $459.4 million was primarily attributable to increased share repurchases during the nine months ended October 3, 2025. \nWe do not have any meaningful debt maturing during the next 12 months. We expect to continue our Share Repurchase Program subject to market conditions, the price of our shares and other factors (including liquidity needs). However, the Share Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nKey Factors Potentially Affecting Liquidity\nWe believe that the key factors that could adversely affect our internal and external sources of cash include, among other considerations:\n•\nchanges in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, supply chain constraints, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, our ability to make progress on the achievement of our business strategy and sustainability goals, the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency, and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business; and\n•\nthe debt and equity capital markets could impact our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time.\nDebt Guarantees and Related Covenants\nAs of October 3, 2025, we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 0% Notes, 0.50% Notes and 3.875% Notes and with covenants included in the Credit Agreement. The 0% Notes, 0.50% Notes and 3.875% Notes are senior to the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of onsemi and its guarantor subsidiaries, rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt and, as unsecured obligations, are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt. \n39\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 3: ''Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Other Developments'' in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and our 2024 Form 10-K."
