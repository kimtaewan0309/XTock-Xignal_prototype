MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOVERVIEW:\nPACCAR is a global technology company whose Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality  light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. In the U.S. and Canada, trucks are sold under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates, in Europe, under the DAF nameplate and in Mexico, Australia and South America, under the Kenworth and DAF nameplates. The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles. The Company’s Financial Services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing PACCAR products in North America, Europe, Australia and South America. The Company’s Other business included the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches through October 31, 2024, when PACCAR sold its industrial winch business.\n \n2024 Financial Highlights\n•\nWorldwide net sales and revenues were $33.66 billion in 2024 compared to $35.13 billion in 2023, primarily due to lower truck revenues, partially offset by higher parts and financial services revenues.\n•\nTruck sales were $24.84 billion in 2024 compared to $26.85 billion in 2023 from lower revenues in Europe and the U.S. and Canada. \n•\nParts sales were $6.67 billion in 2024 compared to $6.41 billion in 2023, reflecting higher price realization in all markets.\n•\nFinancial Services revenues were $2.10 billion in 2024 compared to $1.81 billion in 2023, primarily due to portfolio growth and higher portfolio yields.\n•\nIn 2024, PACCAR earned net income for the 86\nth\n consecutive year. Net income was $4.16 billion ($7.90 per diluted share) in 2024 compared to $4.60 billion ($8.76 per diluted share) in 2023. \n•\nAfter-tax return on beginning equity (ROE) was 26.2% in 2024 compared to 34.9% in 2023. Equity increased 10.3% from $15.88 billion in 2023 to a record $17.51 billion in 2024.\n•\nCapital investments were $795.8 million in 2024 compared to $698.3 million in 2023.\n•\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $452.9 million in 2024 compared to $410.9 million in 2023.\nPACCAR opened its new, 240,000 square-foot Parts Distribution Center (PDC) in Massbach, Germany, in November 2024. This PDC supports DAF’s growth in Germany, Europe’s largest truck market, by enhancing parts delivery to dealers and customers.\n \n \nThe PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) group of companies has operations covering four continents and 26 countries. The global breadth of PFS and its rigorous credit application process support a portfolio of loans and leases with total assets of $22.41 billion. PFS issued $3.65 billion in medium-term notes during 2024 to support new business volume and repay maturing debt.\nTruck Outlook\nTruck industry heavy-duty retail sales in the U.S. and Canada in 2025 are expected to be 250,000 to 280,000 units compared to 268,100\n \nin 2024. In Europe, the 2025 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are expected to be 270,000 to 300,000 units compared to 316,100\n \nin 2024. In South America, heavy-duty truck industry registrations in 2025 are projected to be 115,000 to 125,000 compared to 119,000 in 2024.\n \nParts Outlook\nIn 2025, PACCAR Parts sales are expected to increase\n \n2-4% compared to 2024, depending on the economic conditions.\n \n\n\n18\n \n\n\n\n\n \nFinancial Services Outlook\nIn 2025, average earning assets are expected to be comparable to 2024. The used truck market has normalized in North America, but remains soft in Europe. If freight transportation conditions decline due to a weaker economy, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current levels and new business volume would likely decline.\nCapital Investments and R&D Outlook\nPACCAR's excellent long-term profits, strong balance sheet and consistent focus on quality have enabled the Company to invest $8.6 billion in new and expanded facilities, innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. Capital investments in 2025 are expected to be $700 to $800 million, and R&D is expected to be $460 to $500 million. PACCAR is investing in its truck factories, including expansions at Kenworth Chillicothe, Ohio, PACCAR Mexico, and the DAF truck assembly plant in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Investments in PACCAR's global engine business include additional manufacturing and remanufacturing capacity. In addition to the capital and R&D investments, the Company expects to invest another $400 to $700 million in its battery joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies.\nSee the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nThe Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented below.

Where possible, the Company has quantified the impact of factors identified in the following discussion and analysis. In cases where it is not possible to quantify the impact of factors, the Company lists them in estimated order of importance. Factors for which the Company is unable to specifically quantify the impact include market demand, fuel prices, freight tonnage and economic conditions affecting the Company’s results of operations.\n\n\n19\n \n\n\n\n\n \n2024 Compared to 2023:\nTruck\nThe Company’s Truck segment accounted for 74% of revenues in 2024 compared to 77% in 2023.\nThe Company’s new truck deliveries are summarized below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% CHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n106,400\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n109,100\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45,400\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n63,200\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(28\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico, South America, Australia and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31,900\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal units\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n185,300\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n204,200\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(9\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide new truck deliveries decreased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower deliveries in Europe.\n \nMarket share data discussed below is provided by third-party sources and is measured by either retail sales or registrations for the Company’s dealer network as a percentage of total retail sales or registrations depending on the geographic market. In the U.S. and Canada, market share is based on retail sales. In Europe, market share is based primarily on registrations.\nIn 2024, industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the U.S. and Canada decreased to 268,100 units from 297,000 units in 2023. The Company’s heavy-duty truck retail market share was 30.7% in 2024 compared to 29.5% in 2023. The medium-duty market was 110,400 units in 2024 compared to 105,300 units in 2023. The Company’s medium-duty market share was 18.0% in 2024 compared to 14.5% in 2023.\n \nThe over 16‑tonne truck market in Europe in 2024 decreased to 316,100 units from 343,300 units in 2023, and DAF’s market share was 14.4% in 2024 compared to 15.6% in 2023. The 6 to 16‑tonne market was 50,900 units in 2024 and 46,800 units in 2023. DAF’s market share in the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2024 was 9.5% compared to 9.1% in 2023.\nThe over 16‑tonne truck market in Brasil in 2024 increased to 97,700 units from 82,100 units in 2023, and DAF Brasil's market share was\n \n9.9% in 2024 compared to 10.2% in 2023.\n \nThe Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues are summarized below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% CHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruck net sales and revenues:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,386.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,898.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,998.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,871.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(27\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico, South America, Australia and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,454.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,076.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n24,838.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n26,846.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruck income before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,852.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,799.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(25\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues decreased to $24.84 billion in 2024 from $26.85 billion in 2023 primarily due to lower truck deliveries in Europe.

The increase in cost of sales by $106.3 million reflects higher costs from extended warranty, R&M contracts, dealer support services and lower used truck results.\n•\nThe currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects a decline in the value of the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the increase in value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. \n•\nTruck gross margin was 13.9% in 2024 compared to 16.4% in 2023 due to the factors noted above.\nTruck selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2024 decreased to $254.2 million from $278.5 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses and professional expenses. As a percentage of sales, Truck SG&A was 1.0% in 2024 and 1.0% in 2023.\n\n\n21\n \n\n\n\n\n \nParts\nThe Company’s Parts segment accounted for 20% of revenues in 2024 compared to 18% in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% CHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts net sales and revenues:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,547.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,441.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,424.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,357.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico, South America, Australia and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n694.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n615.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,666.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,414.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts income before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,704.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,702.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe Company’s worldwide parts net sales and revenues increased to $6.67 billion in 2024 from $6.41 billion in 2023 primarily due to higher sales in all markets.\n \nThe major factors for the Parts segment changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNET\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCOST OF\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSALES AND\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSALES AND\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGROSS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nREVENUES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nREVENUES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMARGIN\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,414.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,369.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,044.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease (decrease)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftermarket parts volume\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n89.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n81.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage aftermarket parts sales prices\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n161.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n161.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage aftermarket parts direct costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n143.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(143.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarehouse and other indirect costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(14.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrency translation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(4.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal increase\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n252.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n234.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,666.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,604.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,062.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n•\nAftermarket parts sales volume increased by $89.8 million and related cost of sales increased by $81.2 million, primarily reflecting higher sales volume in all markets except the U.S. and Canada.\n•\nAverage aftermarket parts sales prices increased sales by $161.6 million, primarily due to price realization in Europe and the U.S. and Canada. \n•\nAverage aftermarket parts direct costs increased $143.9 million due to higher material costs, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and higher delivery costs.\n•\nWarehouse and other indirect costs increased $14.2 million primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses. \n•\nThe currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects a decrease in the value of the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. \n•\nParts gross margin was 30.9% in 2024 compared to 31.9% in 2023 due to the factors noted above. \nParts SG&A expense in 2024 increased to $246.4 million from $238.0 million in 2023.

These trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also include trucks acquired from repossessions, through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees (RVGs).\nThe Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $59.0 million in 2024 compared to gains of $43.5 million in 2023, including $40.3 million of losses on multiple unit transactions in 2024 compared to $12.3 million in 2023. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were $9.8 million in 2024 and $4.6 million in 2023.\nThe major factors for the changes in interest and fees, interest and other borrowing expenses and finance margin between 2024 and 2023 are outlined below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nINTEREST \nAND FEES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nINTEREST \nAND OTHER \nBORROWING \nEXPENSES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFINANCE\nMARGIN\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,009.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n500.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n508.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease (decrease)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage finance receivables\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n208.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n208.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage debt balances\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n107.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(107.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYields\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n96.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n96.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorrowing rates\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n113.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(113.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrency translation and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(19.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(10.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(8.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal increase\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n286.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n210.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n76.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,295.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n710.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n585.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n•\nAverage finance receivables increased $2.84\n \nbillion (excluding foreign exchange effects), increasing\n \ninterest and fees by $208.9 million in 2024,\n \nprimarily due to higher average loan, finance lease and dealer wholesale balances in the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and Brasil. \n•\nAverage debt balances increased $2.25\n \nbillion (excluding foreign exchange effects), increasing\n \ninterest and other borrowing costs by $107.9 million in 2024, reflecting\n \nhigher funding requirements for portfolio growth in loans, finance leases and dealer wholesale receivables. \n•\nHigher portfolio yields (7.3% in 2024 compared to 6.7% in 2023) increased\n \ninterest and fees by $96.7 million.

The increased charge-offs in 2024 included three large fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada and two large fleet customers in Europe. The higher charge-offs in 2024 also reflected higher average loss severity in all markets from lower used truck market values.\nThe Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms.\nThe post-modification balances of accounts modified during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nAMORTIZED\nCOST BASIS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% OF TOTAL\nPORTFOLIO*\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAMORTIZED\nCOST BASIS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% OF TOTAL\nPORTFOLIO*\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n441.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n200.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsignificant delay\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n223.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n232.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n330.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n55.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n994.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n487.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n* Amortized cost basis immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end retail portfolio balance.\nModification activity increased to $994.5 million in 2024 from $487.8 million in 2023. The increase in modifications for commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing. The decrease related to Insignificant delay modifications reflects a decrease in customers requesting payment relief for up to three months, primarily in the U.S., partially offset by an increase in customers requesting payment relief for up to three months in Brasil. The increase in Credit modifications reflects higher volumes of contract modifications in the U.S. The higher Credit modification in the U.S. is mainly due to two large fleet customers that were granted a weighted average of five months term extension in 2024. These customers were not past due at the time of modification and at December 31, 2024.\n \nThe following table summarizes the Company’s 30+ days past due accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico, Australia, Brasil and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \nAccounts 30+ days past due increased to 1.3% at December 31, 2024 from 1.0% at December 31, 2023. The increased percentage of past due accounts is primarily due to two large fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada and higher past due accounts in Brasil and Europe, partially offset by decreases in past due accounts in Australia. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.\n\n\n26\n \n\n\n\n\n \nWhen the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $40.7 million and $35.0 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023, respectively, which were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico, Australia, Brasil and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Company typically requires customers to pay current before granting modifications. The higher pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due in the U.S. and Canada at December 31, 2024 was primarily due to a modification with an insignificant term extension granted to one large fleet customer with additional collateral. The higher pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due in Mexico, Australia, Brasil and other was primarily due to accounts modified in Brasil.\n \n \nA contract modification that improves the past due status reduces the probability of default. The effect of modifications is included in the Company’s historical loss information used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \nThe Company’s annualized pre-tax return on average total assets for Financial Services was 2.0% in 2024 compared to 2.9% in 2023, respectively.\n \nOther\n \nIncluded in Other is the Company’s industrial winch manufacturing business through October 31, 2024, as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2024 and 2023. Other SG&A decreased to $84.4 million in 2024 from $87.8 million in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in professional fees partially offset by higher salaries and related expenses.\nOther income before tax was $13.5 million in 2024 compared to a loss of $616.8 million in 2023, primarily due to the EC-related charge in the first quarter 2023 which is discussed in Note L of the consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment income increased to $394.7 million in 2024 from $292.2 million in 2023, primarily due to higher average investment balances in all regions as well as higher investment yields due to higher market interest rates, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2024, the effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 19.5% in 2023. The lower effective tax rate in 2023 was primarily due to a $119.7 million discrete tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Brasil. Also included in 2023 was the EC-related charge of $600.0 million, which lowered the effective tax rate in 2023.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic income before taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,525.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,913.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign income before taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,875.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,804.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal income before taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,400.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,718.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic pre-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign pre-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal pre-tax return on revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn 2024, domestic income before income taxes and domestic pre-tax return on revenues decreased primarily due to lower Truck operation results.

The increased operating cash flow reflects lower net income of $438.8 million, $241.5 million higher cash provided from net income items not affecting cash, primarily deferred income taxes and the provision for losses on financial services receivables, and lower cash usage from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $661.7 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities are mainly due to higher cash provided by net changes in operating assets, primarily wholesale receivables on new trucks in the Financial Services segment of $787.7 million, trade and other receivables of $587.6 million and lower cash usage of $393.2 million for inventories, partially offset by decrease in accruals of $1,084.7 million, including the EC-related charge and product support liabilities.\nInvesting activities:\n Cash used in investing activities increased by $1.62 billion to $4.49 billion in 2024 from $2.87 billion in 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects increased purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, of $801.9 million, a higher net increase in wholesale receivables on equipment of $483.0 million, increased acquisition of equipment on operating leases of $339.4 million and cash contributed to the battery manufacturing joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies, of $207.6 million. Increased cash used in investing activities was partially offset by cash received from the sale of PACCAR Winch Inc.\nFinancing activities:\n Cash used in financing activities was $123.1 million in 2024 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1.10 billion in 2023, reflecting higher cash dividends and lower net borrowing activity. The Company paid $2.29 billion in dividends in 2024 compared to $1.52 billion in 2023, primarily due to a higher year-end dividend paid in January 2024. Cash provided from net borrowing activities was $2.12 billion, $454.8 million lower than the cash provided by net borrowing activities of $2.57 billion in 2023.\n \n\n\n28\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash decreased cash and cash equivalents by $151.4 million in 2024, reflecting a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. In 2023, an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, increased cash and cash equivalents by $69.6 million.\nThe Company expects to continue paying dividends, although there is no assurance as to future dividends because they are dependent upon future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions. Cash dividends declared for the last two years were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQUARTER\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n.27\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n.25\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.25\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.27\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.27\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-End Extra (paid in January of the following year)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.00\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.20\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal dividends declared per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.17\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.24\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCredit Lines and Other:\nThe Company has line of credit arrangements of $5.48 billion, of which $4.96 billion were unused at December 31, 2024. Included in these arrangements are $4.00 billion of committed bank facilities, of which $1.50 billion expires in June 2025, $1.25 billion expires in June 2027 and $1.25 billion expires in June 2029. The Company intends to extend or replace these credit facilities on or before expiration to maintain facilities of similar amounts and duration. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. There were no borrowings under the committed bank facilities for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOn December 4, 2018, PACCAR’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock without an expiration. The objective of the repurchase plan is to return value to PACCAR shareholders. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has repurchased $110.0 million of shares under this plan. There were no repurchases made under this plan during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n \nTruck, Parts and Other\nThe Company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, R&D, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. Management expects this method of funding to continue in the future.\nInvestments for manufacturing property, plant and equipment in 2024 were $787.3 million\n \ncompared to $679.4 million in 2023. Over the past decade, the Company’s combined investments in worldwide capital projects and R&D totaled $8.48\n \nbillion and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the Company’s premium products.\n \nCapital investments in 2025 are expected to be $700 to $800 million, and R&D is expected to be $460 to $500 million. PACCAR is investing in its truck factories, including expansions at Kenworth Chillicothe, Ohio, PACCAR Mexico, and the DAF truck assembly plant in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Investments in PACCAR's global engine business include additional manufacturing and remanufacturing capacity. In addition to the capital and R&D investments, the Company expects to invest another $400 to $700 million in its battery joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies.\nFinancial Services\nThe Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans.\n\n\n29\n \n\n\n\n\n \nIn November 2024, the Company’s U.S. finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC), filed a shelf registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFC as of December 31, 2024 was $7.25 billion. The registration expires in November 2027 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company’s European finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Europe, had €597.9 million available for issuance under a €2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This program renews annually and expires in July 2025.\n \nIn August 2021, PACCAR Financial Mexico registered a 10.00 billion Mexican peso program with the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores to issue medium-term notes and commercial paper. The registration expires in August 2026 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion Mexican pesos. At December 31, 2024, 5.57 billion Mexican pesos were available for issuance.\n \nIn August 2018, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Pty. Ltd. (PFPL Australia), established a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFPL Australia as of December 31, 2024 was 700.0 million Australian dollars.\nIn May 2021, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Ltd. (PFL Canada), established a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. There were no borrowings under this program as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Banco PACCAR S.A., established a lending program in December 2021 with the local development bank, Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES), for qualified customers to receive preferential conditions and generally market interest rates. This program is limited to 2.60 billion Brazilian reais and has 1.15 billion Brazilian reais outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The Brazilian subsidiary also established a Letra Financeira (LF) program in May 2024 and the program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. A total of 500.0 million Brazilian reais medium-term notes were outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, committed bank facilities, and current investment-grade credit ratings of A+/A1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the Company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. In the event of a decrease in the Company’s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets. In such circumstances, the Company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its various sources of liquidity, including committed bank facilities, would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations.\n\n\n30\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCommitments\n \nThe following summarizes the Company’s contractual cash commitments at December 31, 2024:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMATURITY\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nWITHIN 1\nYEAR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1-3\nYEARS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3-5\nYEARS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMORE THAN\n5 YEARS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorrowings*\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,359.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,589.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,647.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n350.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,946.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest on debt**\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n408.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n440.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n108.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n73.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,031.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase obligations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n128.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n184.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n138.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n541.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n81.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther obligations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n81.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n94.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,999.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,253.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,909.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n533.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17,695.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n*   Commercial paper included in borrowings is at par value.\n** Interest on floating-rate debt is based on the applicable market rates at December 31, 2024.\nTotal cash commitments for borrowings and interest on term debt were $16.98 billion and were related to the Financial Services segment. As described in Note J of the consolidated financial statements, borrowings consist primarily of term notes and commercial paper issued by the Financial Services segment. The Company expects to fund its maturing Financial Services debt obligations principally from funds provided by collections from customers on loans and lease contracts, as well as from the proceeds of commercial paper and medium-term note borrowings. Purchase obligations are the Company’s contractual commitments to acquire future production inventory and capital equipment. Other obligations primarily include commitments for commodities.\n \nThe Company’s other commitments include the following at December 31, 2024:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCOMMITMENT EXPIRATION\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nWITHIN 1\nYEAR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1-3\nYEARS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3-5\nYEARS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMORE THAN\n5 YEARS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoan and lease commitments\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n949.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n949.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidual value guarantees\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n306.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n237.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n74.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n632.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetters of credit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,266.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n237.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n75.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n25.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,605.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nLoan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts. Residual value guarantees represent the Company’s commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future.\n \nIMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:\nThe Company, its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment and greenhouse gases. The statutory and regulatory requirements governing greenhouse gas and non-greenhouse gas emissions are included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Emissions Requirements and Reduction Targets.” The Company believes its policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred.\n \nThe Company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. In certain of these matters, the Company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. The Company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the Company will incur such costs in the future. Expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $4.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively. While the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined, management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the Company’s consolidated cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\n\n\n31\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note A of the consolidated financial statements. In the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. The following are accounting policies which, in the opinion of management, are particularly sensitive and which, if actual results are different from estimates used by management, may have a material impact on the financial statements.\n \nOperating Leases\nTrucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in Note F of the consolidated financial statements. In determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles, the Company considers the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. Operating lease terms generally range from three to five years. The resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30% and 70% of the original equipment cost. If the sales price of a truck at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the Company’s estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result.\n \nFuture market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the Company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. Residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. A decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term.\n \nDuring 2024, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally lower than the residual values on the equipment, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of $22.7 million.\n \nAt December 31, 2024, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the Financial Services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the Truck segment was $1.16 billion. A 10% decrease in used truck values worldwide, if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the Company’s operating leases, would reduce residual value estimates and result in the Company recording additional depreciation expense of approximately $46.3 million in 2025, $20.5 million in 2026, $19.4 million in 2027, $16.4 million in 2028, and $13.2 million in 2029 and thereafter.\n \nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses related to the Company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in Note E of the consolidated financial statements. The Company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. The retail segment consists of retail loans and sales-type finance leases, net of unearned interest. The wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. The wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. Wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the Company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases, obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. In determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over\n \nthree to five years, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves.\n \nThe Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for expected credit losses. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. In general, finance receivables that are 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual status. Finance receivables on non-accrual status which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments.\n \nIndividually evaluated receivables on non-accrual status are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale receivables on non-accrual status are individually evaluated for loss based on the value of the underlying collateral or a discounted cash flow analysis. Small balance receivables on non-accrual status with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below.\n\n\n32\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe Company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually evaluated and share similar risk characteristics on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data, current market conditions, and expected changes in future macroeconomic conditions that affect collectability. Historical credit loss data provides relevant information of expected credit losses. The historical information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, and the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse.\n \nThe Company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers and their ability to repay. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in forecasted economic conditions that are specific to the industry and markets in which the Company conducts business. The Company utilizes economic forecasts from third-party sources and determines expected losses based on historical experience under similar market conditions. After determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of expected credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.\nThe adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current and future market conditions. As accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. The Company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 10% and 80%. Over the past two years, the Company’s year-end 30+ days past due accounts have ranged between 1.0% and 1.3% of loan and lease receivables. Historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 1 to 25\n \nbasis points of receivables. At December 31, 2024, 30+ days past dues were 1.3%. If past dues were 100 basis points higher or 2.3% as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of $1 to $35 million depending on the extent of the past dues, the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors.\n \nProduct Warranty\nProduct warranty, including changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties, is disclosed in Note I of the consolidated financial statements. The expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. Estimates consider product type, geographical differences, labor rates, and any other known factors affecting the number or amount of expected claim payments. For new products with no historical experience, reference to similar products is utilized. Management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. Historically those adjustments have not been material. Over the past two years, warranty expense as a percentage of Truck, Parts and Other net sales and revenues has ranged between 2.5% and 2.9%. If the 2024 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2024, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $63 million.\n \nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nThis report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to future results of operations or financial position and any other statement that does not relate to any historical or current fact.
