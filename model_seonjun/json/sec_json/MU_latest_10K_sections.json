With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, and manufacturing and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applications that unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience.\nWe manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors for certain manufacturing processes. Our global network of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while streamlining processes and operations, but it also brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the most advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring expertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in partnership with teams, such as R&D, product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain. For our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We continue to make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive, we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of inflationary pressures, changing technologies, rapid market changes, and regulatory uncertainty. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, and efficient capital spending.\nBusiness Segments\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, we reorganized our business units.

Cloud-native workloads are driving growth through use cases such as AI-enabled intelligent edge devices and augmented reality platforms that store and access data in the cloud or rely on the cloud for compute capability. Cloud servers supporting AI and data-centric workloads require significantly increasing quantities of DRAM, including HBM, and NAND as the task of turning data into insight becomes increasingly memory-centric. \nIn 2024, we began volume production of our 8-high 24GB HBM3E with increased bandwidth and superior power efficiency enabled by our advanced 1β process node. In the fourth quarter of 2025, HBM3E 12-high represented the majority of our HBM shipments. This enhanced version of HBM delivers faster data rates, improved thermal response, and a higher monolithic die density within the same package footprint as previous generations. In 2025, we delivered samples of HBM4 36GB 12-high to multiple key customers to power next-generation AI platforms.\nAs modern servers pack more processing cores into central processing units (“CPUs”), the memory bandwidth per CPU core has been decreasing. Our DDR5 alleviates this bottleneck by providing higher bandwidth than previous generations, enabling improved performance and scaling. In 2024, we qualified and began shipping our 128GB DDR5 server module, built on a monolithic 32GB DRAM die and powered by our 1ß node. This innovative product provides an industry alternative to existing 3D TSV-based solutions to address the rigorous speed and capacity demands of memory-intensive generative AI applications.

In 2025, AEBU sales to the automotive, industrial, and consumer embedded markets consisted primarily\n of LPDDR5 and LPDDR4, managed NAND, DDR4 and DDR3, and GDDR6 products.\nMarketing and Customers\nWe seek to build collaborative relationships with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges. By engaging with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products, we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address our customers’ changing needs. Collaborating with our customers on their design needs in changing end markets and meeting their timelines for qualifying new products allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers.\n11 |\n \n2025 10-K\nTable of Contents\nOur semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our Micron and Crucial brand names and through private labels. We market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices to support our worldwide customer base. Our products are also offered through distributors, retailers, and independent sales representatives. Our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including our competitors’ products. Our independent sales representatives obtain orders, subject to final acceptance by us, and we then make shipments against these orders directly to customers or through our distributors. We sell our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer-direct sales channel, as well as through channel and distribution partners. We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products.\nDue to volatile industry conditions, our customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price purchase contracts. We typically enter into long-term agreements with our customers with acknowledgment that pricing, quantity, and other terms will be periodically negotiated to reflect market conditions and our customers’ demand for our products.\nIn each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total revenue was from our top ten customers. For other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 28. Certain Concentrations.\nCompetitive Conditions\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Sandisk Corporation; ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”); and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”). Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may operate in jurisdictions with lower labor and compliance costs and may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. Alternatively, new entrants into the memory and storage market could have a significant adverse impact on our competitive position. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates, import/export restrictions, and other trade regulations, including tariffs.\nIn addition, governments have provided, and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. As a result, we face the threat of increasing competition and DRAM and NAND oversupply due to significant investment in the semiconductor industry, including by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, such as CXMT and YMTC. In addition, the May 2023 decision by China’s Cyberspace Administration (the “CAC”) that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere. \nWe intend to advance our process technology to increase bit output per wafer, improve yields, and increase wafer supply. In addition, our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to construct new fabrication facilities and/or ramp production at existing fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages.\n \n12\nTable of Contents\nManufacturing\nWe manufacture our products within our own facilities located in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, the United States, Malaysia, China, and India and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. Our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Semiconductor manufacturing is capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. Our DRAM, NAND, and NOR products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and certain resources and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines.\nOur process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves numerous precise steps, including wafer fabrication, post-fabrication processing, assembly, and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers, NAND cell levels, process complexity (including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps), and manufacturing yield. Other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, cost of raw materials, labor productivity and cost, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. As we continue to increase our production of high-value products and solutions, manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of application-specific integrated circuit controllers and other semiconductors, advanced and complex packaging configurations, and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels. We continuously enhance our production processes, increase bits per wafer, transition to higher density products, and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes.\nWafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be non-functional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, or contamination from airborne particles, among other factors. Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and improving process margin to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. We continue to heighten quality control as our product offerings expand into higher-end segments that require increasing performance targets.\nOur products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die. Our packaged products include packaged die, memory modules, and system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and MCPs. We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain packaged die, memory modules, SSDs, and MCPs. We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high-temperature burn-in on finished products. In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.\nIn recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products; the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products; and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines.\n13 |\n \n2025 10-K\nTable of Contents\nWe have commenced expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions where we operate. Semiconductor fabs are complex, capital-intensive projects and require specialized knowledge, expertise, experience, and skill sets to construct and operate. Our construction projects are highly dependent on available sources of materials and specialized equipment, as well as labor, skilled sub-contractors, and other service providers. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in shortages and higher costs. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining labor, skilled sub-contractors, and other service providers or other resources could result in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, including costs to operate these facilities. In the United States and in certain other regions, fab building has been uncommon in recent years. Concurrent semiconductor expansion projects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of construction talent with requisite expertise and experience in these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in the United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than we would experience in geographies with more established ecosystems. \nResources\nSupply Chain, Materials, and Third-Party Service Providers\nOur supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components, such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresists, semiconductors, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future because of the nature of the industry. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes, resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In periods of shortage, we may be required to incur increased costs in order to meet our contractual commitments and demand from our customers or experience a decrease in revenue. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely manner or at all from other providers.\n \n14\nTable of Contents\nCertain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is a predominant producer of these materials. China has in the past restricted export of certain of these materials and may in the future continue to restrict, expand restrictions, or stop exporting these or other materials, and as a result, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained, and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China.\nWe and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, acts of war, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, and retaliatory actions in response to such actions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent on a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electrical power, gas, and water to our manufacturing facilities. Any power shortages, capacity constraints, prolonged outages, or significant or unexpected increases in the cost of power could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nSimilarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nPatents and Licenses\nAs of August 28, 2025, we have been granted over 60,000 patents and we owned approximately 15,000 active U.S. patents and 7,500 active foreign patents. In addition, we have thousands of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2044.\nFrom time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties, and we continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investments in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements.\nWe have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us.\n15 |\n \n2025 10-K\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nOur R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of memory and storage solutions, including our industry-leading DRAM and NAND technology, that enable continuous improvement in performance and cost structure for our products. In 2025, we began shipping the 1γ production node, which is our first DRAM node incorporating EUV lithography. We also began volume production on our Micron G9 NAND node. We are well-positioned with our industry-leading HBM3E technology. Our HBM4 technology is advancing and remains on schedule for volume production in calendar 2026. We are also focused on developing new and fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. Additional R&D efforts are concentrated on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures and the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise. Product design and development efforts include HBM, DDR5, LPDDR5, high-capacity MRDIMMs, compute express link (“CXL”) based products, and advanced graphics DRAM; TLC and QLC NAND technologies; storage solutions (including firmware and controllers) in SSDs and managed NAND; and other memory technologies and systems.\nTo compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. The continued evolution of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected customer requirements for memory and storage products and solutions. Our process, design, firmware, controller, package, and system development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world. Our R&D centers are located in Boise, Idaho; San Jose, California; India; Japan; Taiwan; Singapore; China; Italy; Mexico; Germany; Malaysia; and other sites in the United States.\nR&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed and end-product solutions developed, personnel costs, and the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, such as investments in EUV lithography equipment. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance, functionality, and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification and product specifications.\nHuman Capital\nWe depend on a highly educated and experienced workforce to design, develop, and manufacture high-quality, cutting-edge memory and storage solutions. As of August 28, 2025, we had approximately 53,000 employees located primarily in Asia, North America, and Europe.\nTalent Acquisition, Development, and Engagement\nFinding and retaining the best and brightest people in an extremely competitive industry environment is a strategic imperative for our business. We partner with our communities, institutions, governments, and associations to expand the pipeline of highly skilled STEM talent globally. Our partnerships with primary, secondary, and post-secondary education systems are key to training and inspiring the next generation to consider STEM careers in the semiconductor industry. On hiring, we focus on merit and use a variety of means to find the best talent. We are committed to empowering our team members through continuous learning, developing team members at all stages of their careers, including on-the-job training, continuing education, a robust mentoring program, and numerous internal certifications and training. We equip our team members with the latest AI tools and training to unlock human potential and labor productivity. In addition, we develop and accelerate our leaders’ careers through targeted learning that helps them move to higher-level positions or across functions.\nWe use a research-based, people-centric approach to understanding and improving team member engagement. Listening to our team members is emphasized by the Micron Voice program, a survey which encompasses engagement, culture, leadership behaviors, well-being and inclusion to learn more from our team members. \n \n16\nTable of Contents\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur compensation programs are designed to support our team members’ financial and personal well-being by providing a valuable return for their contributions to the Company. Our total rewards strategy includes base salary, bonuses, equity awards, a discounted stock purchase plan, and a comprehensive benefits package. We have a regular review of pay globally, including base pay, annual bonuses, and stock awards, to ensure fairness in our compensation practices.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended August 28, 2025. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52\n-\n or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 each contained 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts.\nOverview\nFor an overview of our business, see Part I, Item 1. Business, Overview.\nIndustry Conditions\nAI-driven demand is accelerating and is outpacing industry supply. In 2025, we benefited from substantial improvements in DRAM pricing, volumes and margins as compared to 2024, reflecting strong demand growth, driven in part by the continued advancement of AI. During 2025, we shifted a portion of our DRAM supply to the data center and hyperscale cloud markets to meet the strong demand fueled by AI, with emphasis on HBM products, resulting in a revenue mix weighted more prominently toward segments experiencing higher growth. The pivot to higher-growth segments, together with our strong execution, robust overall industry DRAM demand, and constrained supply, has led to improved profitability across our DRAM portfolio. In 2025, NAND revenue increased from 2024 on higher bit shipments due to demand growth. The 2025 NAND gross margin percentage increased from 2024 due to cost reductions. We continue to prudently manage our NAND business to ensure we align our supply growth and technology node cadence with our projections of the demand environment.\nThroughout 2024, we experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins due to improving market conditions as compared to 2023. Increasing demand growth, driven in part by deployment of AI and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline, resulted in an industry supply and demand balance that substantially improved from downturn conditions in memory and storage markets during 2023. In connection with improved market conditions in 2024, we reinstated our bonuses and phased out certain other temporary cost-saving measures that were implemented in 2023. \nIn 2023, China’s Cyberspace Administration (the “CAC”) conducted a cybersecurity review of our products sold in China and decided that our products presented a cybersecurity risk. The CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products. The CAC decision has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking markets in China, and we have been working to mitigate that impact.\n51 |\n \n2025 10-K\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nFor the year ended\n2025\n2024\n2023\nRevenue\n$\n37,378 \n100 \n%\n$\n25,111 \n100 \n%\n$\n15,540 \n100 \n%\nCost of goods sold\n22,505 \n60 \n%\n19,498 \n78 \n%\n16,956 \n109 \n%\nGross margin\n14,873 \n40 \n%\n5,613 \n22 \n%\n(1,416)\n(9)\n%\nResearch and development\n3,798 \n10 \n%\n3,430 \n14 \n%\n3,114 \n20 \n%\nSelling, general, and administrative\n1,205 \n3 \n%\n1,129 \n4 \n%\n920 \n6 \n%\nRestructure and asset impairments\n39 \n— \n%\n1 \n— \n%\n171 \n1 \n%\nOther operating (income) expense, net\n61 \n— \n%\n(251)\n(1)\n%\n124 \n1 \n%\nOperating income (loss)\n9,770 \n26 \n%\n1,304 \n5 \n%\n(5,745)\n(37)\n%\nInterest income (expense), net\n19 \n— \n%\n(33)\n— \n%\n80 \n1 \n%\nOther non-operating income (expense), net\n(135)\n— \n%\n(31)\n— \n%\n7 \n— \n%\nIncome tax (provision) benefit\n(1,124)\n(3)\n%\n(451)\n(2)\n%\n(177)\n(1)\n%\nEquity in net income (loss) of equity method investees\n9 \n— \n%\n(11)\n— \n%\n2 \n— \n%\nNet income (loss)\n$\n8,539 \n23 \n%\n$\n778 \n3 \n%\n$\n(5,833)\n(38)\n%\nTotal Revenue:\n Total revenue was impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above. These conditions drove substantial improvements in average selling prices throughout 2025 and 2024.\nTotal revenue for 2025 increased 49% as compared to 2024 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products.\n•\nSales of DRAM products increased 62% primarily due to a low-40% range increase in average selling prices and a mid-teen percentage increase in bit shipments.\n•\nSales of NAND products increased 18% primarily due to a high-teen percentage increase in bit shipments.\nTotal revenue for 2024 increased 62% as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products.\n•\nSales of DRAM products increased 60% primarily due to a mid-40% range increase in bit shipments and a low-teen percentage range increase in average selling prices.\n•\nSales of NAND products increased 72% primarily due to a low-30% range increase in bit shipments and a low-30% percentage range increase in average selling prices.\nConsolidated Gross Margin: \nOur consolidated gross margin has been impacted by the factors described in the section titled “Industry Conditions” above and the effects of 2023 inventory write-downs on our 2024 and 2023 gross margin, as detailed in the table below. Our consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 40% for 2025 from 22% for 2024 as a result of improvements in margins for both DRAM and NAND products. DRAM margins improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices, an increased mix of higher-margin products, including HBM, and manufacturing cost reductions driven by improvements in product and process technology. NAND margins improved primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions. Our consolidated gross margin for 2024 reflected $987 million of benefit due to lower costs from the sale of inventories written down to their net realizable value in 2023 (as detailed in “Inventory NRV Write-Downs” below).\nOur consolidated gross margin percentage improved to 22% for 2024 from negative 9% for 2023 as a result of improvements in margins for both DRAM and NAND products, primarily due to increases in average selling prices, manufacturing cost reductions, the effects of charges to write down inventories to their NRV in 2023, and lower costs in 2024 from the sale of inventories written down in 2023 (as detailed in “Inventory NRV Write-Downs” below).\n \n52\nTable of Contents\nInventory NRV Write-Downs\n: \nOur consolidated gross margin was impacted by charges in 2023 to write down inventories to their estimated NRV as a result of declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND. As charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold, costs of goods sold in subsequent periods were lower than they otherwise would be. The impact of inventory NRV write-downs for each period reflects (1) inventory write-downs in that period, offset by (2) lower costs in that period on the sale of inventory written down in prior periods. The impacts of inventory NRV write-downs are summarized below:\nFor the year ended\n2025\n2024\n2023\nProvision to write down inventory to NRV\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(1,831)\nLower costs from sale of inventory written down in prior periods\n— \n987 \n844 \n$\n— \n$\n987 \n$\n(987)\nRevenue by Business Unit\nFor the year ended\n2025\n2024\n2023\nCMBU\n$\n13,524 \n36 \n%\n$\n3,792 \n15 \n%\n$\n1,872 \n12 \n%\nCDBU\n7,229 \n19 \n%\n4,984 \n20 \n%\n2,124 \n14 \n%\nMCBU\n11,859 \n32 \n%\n11,667 \n46 \n%\n7,394 \n48 \n%\nAEBU\n4,753 \n13 \n%\n4,631 \n18 \n%\n4,139 \n27 \n%\nAll other\n13 \n— \n%\n37 \n— \n%\n11 \n— \n%\n \n$\n37,378 \n$\n25,111 \n$\n15,540 \nPercentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding.\nChanges in revenue for each business unit for 2025 as compared to 2024 were as follows:\n•\nCMBU revenue increased 257% primarily due to increases in DRAM bit shipments and average selling prices driven by accelerating AI demand in cloud server markets for HBM, high-capacity dual in-line memory modules (“DIMMS”), and low-power server DRAM. During 2025, CMBU revenue benefited from a shift of our DRAM supply to meet the strong demand in high-value data center markets.\n•\nCDBU revenue increased 45% primarily due to increases in average selling prices for both data center DRAM and NAND and NAND bit shipments due to increased demand for data center SSDs.\n•\nMCBU revenue increased 2% primarily due to increases in DRAM and NAND revenue.

Increases in NAND sales due to higher bit shipments were partially offset by decreases in NAND average selling prices.\n•\nAEBU revenue increased 3% primarily due to increases in DRAM and NAND bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND as a result of pricing pressure for certain legacy products.\nChanges in revenue for each business unit for 2024 as compared to 2023 were as follows:\n•\nCMBU revenue increased 103% driven by increases in DRAM bit shipments and average selling prices.\n•\nCDBU revenue increased 135% primarily due to increases in NAND and DRAM bit shipments and average selling prices.\n•\nMCBU revenue increased 58% primarily due to increases in DRAM and NAND bit shipments and average selling prices for both mobile and client markets.\n•\nAEBU revenue increased 12% primarily due to increases in DRAM bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices.\n53 |\n \n2025 10-K\nTable of Contents\nOperating Income (Loss) by Business Unit\nFor the year ended\n2025\n2024\n2023\nCMBU\n$\n6,129 \n45 \n%\n$\n244 \n6 \n%\n$\n(768)\n(41)\n%\nCDBU\n2,180 \n30 \n%\n255 \n5 \n%\n(563)\n(27)\n%\nMCBU\n1,981 \n17 \n%\n(1)\n— \n%\n(3,189)\n(43)\n%\nAEBU\n557 \n12 \n%\n432 \n9 \n%\n680 \n16 \n%\nAll other\n(1)\n(8)\n%\n18 \n49 \n%\n8 \n73 \n%\n \n$\n10,846 \n$\n948 \n$\n(3,832)\nPercentages reflect operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue for each business unit.\nChanges in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2025 as compared to 2024 were as follows:\n•\nCMBU operating income increased primarily due to higher bit shipments and increases in average selling prices driven by robust AI demand in cloud server markets, particularly for HBM, DIMMs, and low-power server DRAM products. CMBU operating income benefited from a shift of our DRAM supply to meet the strong demand in high-value data center markets. These improvements were partially offset by higher R&D expenses.\n•\nCDBU operating income increased primarily due to increases in data center average selling prices, higher bit shipments, and manufacturing cost reductions.\n•\nMCBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in DRAM average selling prices, manufacturing cost reductions, and higher NAND bit shipments, partially offset by decreases in NAND average selling prices. MCBU operating income (loss) was also adversely impacted by decreases in DRAM bit shipments as MCBU product supply was constrained to meet demand from higher-value segments.\n•\nAEBU operating income increased primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and higher bit shipments, partially offset by declines in average selling prices.\nChanges in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2024 as compared to 2023 were as follows:\n•\nCMBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to higher bit shipments, increases in average selling prices, and manufacturing cost reductions.\n•\nCDBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to higher NAND and DRAM bit shipments, increases in average selling prices, and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by higher R&D expenses.\n•\nMCBU operating income (loss) improved primarily due to increases in average selling prices, higher bit shipments, and manufacturing cost reductions.\n•\nAEBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in average selling prices, partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions and higher bit shipments.\nOperating Expenses and Other\nResearch and Development: \nR&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed and end-product solutions developed, personnel costs, and the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance, functionality, and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification and product specifications. \nR&D expenses for 2025 increased 11% as compared to 2024 primarily due to increases in employee compensation, depreciation expense, and higher volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers. R&D expenses for 2024 increased 10% as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and higher volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers, partially offset by an increase in government incentives.\nSelling, General, and Administrative: \nSG&A expenses for 2025 increased 7% as compared to 2024 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and professional services. SG&A expenses for 2024 increased 23% as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation. \n \n54\nTable of Contents\nInterest Income (Expense), Net:\n \nInterest income (expense) improved in 2025 as compared to 2024 primarily due to decreases in interest expense as a result of increased capitalized interest driven by higher levels of building construction, partially offset by decreases in interest income due to lower interest rates on our cash and investments. Interest income (expense) deteriorated for 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases in interest expense as a result of higher interest rates on our debt, partially offset by increases in interest income due to higher interest rates on our cash and investments.\nIncome Taxes: \nOur income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:\nFor the year ended\n2025\n2024\n2023\nIncome (loss) before taxes\n$\n9,654 \n$\n1,240 \n$\n(5,658)\nIncome tax (provision) benefit\n(1,124)\n(451)\n(177)\nEffective tax rate\n11.6 \n%\n36.4 \n%\n(3.1)\n%\nThe change in our effective tax rate for 2025 as compared to 2024, and for 2024 as compared to 2023, were primarily due to changes in profitability. Despite a consolidated pre-tax loss on a worldwide basis in 2023, we had taxes payable in certain geographies due to minimum taxable income reportable in those geographies. \nWe operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $1.05 billion (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.93) for 2025. As a result of the low level of profitability and the jurisdictional mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for 2024 or 2023.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted, introducing broad changes to the U.S. tax code, including modifications to corporate and international tax provisions, which primarily are effective for us beginning in 2026 and 2027. The aggregate impact of the OBBBA remains uncertain. We will continue to monitor future developments, including regulatory guidance and interpretations, which could have a material impact. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit-shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. On November 27, 2024, Singapore enacted legislation to implement Pillar Two, which will apply to us starting in 2026. We continue to monitor for additional guidance and legislative changes related to Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate.\nVarious tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements.\nOther:\n \nFurther information can be found in the following notes contained in Item 8.

Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $11.94 billion as of August 28, 2025, and $9.15 billion as of August 29, 2024. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of August 28, 2025, $5.20 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. We expect to engage in a variety of financing transactions, from time to time, for such purposes, as well as to refinance our existing indebtedness, including the issuance of securities. As of August 28, 2025, $3.50 billion was available to draw under our Revolving Credit Facility. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives. Our incentives are conditioned upon achieving or maintaining certain outcomes and satisfying compliance requirements and are subject to reduction, termination, or clawback.\nTo develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We estimate capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be approximately $4.5 billion in first quarter of 2026. While quarterly expenditures may fluctuate, this level serves as a reasonable quarterly baseline for the planned capital expenditures for 2026. Actual amounts for 2026 will vary depending on market conditions and may vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenditures and proceeds from government incentives. As of August 28, 2025, we had purchase obligations of approximately $1.77 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other contractual obligations, such as leases, debt, and commitments, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9. Leases, as well as Note 12. Debt and Note 13. Commitments. \nIn addition to the supply capacity we generate through our proprietary product and process technology that increases bit density per wafer, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity to support projected memory demand in the second half of the decade. Following the enactment of the CHIPS Act, we announced plans to invest in leading-edge memory manufacturing sites in Idaho and New York, based on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. \nAs part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with first DRAM wafer output projected in the second half of calendar 2027. In June 2025, in connection with certain amendments to our CHIPS Act agreements, we announced plans for a second leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Idaho to serve growing market demand fueled by AI. \nOur announced plan for New York includes construction of a leading-edge DRAM memory manufacturing site, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We continue to work with state and federal authorities for approval to start ground preparation, and anticipate production to ramp after the completion of the second Idaho fab. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity, in line with industry demand trends and our objective of maintaining stable bit share.\nOn December 9, 2024, we entered into direct funding agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1 billion in direct funding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for a planned fab in Boise, Idaho, and two planned fabs in Clay, New York. On June 11, 2025, we entered into amendments to the direct funding agreements to add a second planned fab in Boise, Idaho, and allocate certain award funding from the $6.1 billion grants previously awarded to the second planned Idaho fab. The direct funding for up to $6.1 billion remains unchanged. On June 11, 2025, we also entered into a direct funding agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $275 million in direct funding to expand and modernize our fab in Manassas, Virginia. The grants under the funding agreements represent total CHIPS Act grants of up to $6.4 billion in connection with our U.S. manufacturing expansion and modernization projects. In addition, we announced plans to bring advanced HBM packaging capabilities to the U.S.\n \n56\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the CHIPS Act direct funding, we receive a 35% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We have also signed a non-binding term sheet with the State of New York that provides for up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility over the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for eligible new job wages.\nOutside the U.S., we are investing in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D, and advancing our global back-end assembly and test network. These investments support our product portfolio and extend our ability to meet global market demand in the future. Planned investments and those underway include the following:\n•\nIndia: \nour construction is progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat to address demand in the latter half of this decade;\n•\nJapan: \nwe are modernizing our Hiroshima manufacturing facility to support the production of DRAM using EUV lithography;\n•\nSingapore:\n we broke ground on an HBM advanced packaging facility to meaningfully expand our total advanced packaging capacity beginning in calendar 2027; and\n•\nTaiwan:\n we are modernizing our production capacity for DRAM and HBM products to meet rising market demand.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20. Government Incentives.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions, restrictions applicable under our CHIPS Act direct funding agreements, and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. Through August 28, 2025, we had repurchased an aggregate of $7.19 billion under the authorization. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15. Equity, as well as Note 20. Government Incentives.\nOn September 23, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on October 21, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 3, 2025. The declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors’ decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nWe expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, funding from government incentives, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n17,525 \n$\n8,507 \n$\n1,559 \nNet cash used for investing activities\n(14,087)\n(8,309)\n(6,191)\nNet cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n(850)\n(1,842)\n4,983 \nEffect of changes in currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n6 \n40 \n(34)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n2,594 \n$\n(1,604)\n$\n317 \nOperating Activities:\n Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, inventory write-downs, and asset impairments, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities\n. \n57 |\n \n2025 10-K\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2025 as compared to 2024 was primarily due to higher net income in 2025 adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of changes in receivables and accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decrease in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to net income in 2024 adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and an increase in other current liabilities largely due to customer prepayments to secur\ne p\nroduct supply, partially offset by an increase in receivables.\n \nInvesting Activities:\n For 2025, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $15.86 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and $192 million of net outflows from purchases, maturities, and sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by $2.01 billion of proceeds from government incentives to offset capital expenditures.\nFor 2024, net cash used for investing activi\nties consisted primarily of $8.39 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and $205 million of net outflows from purchases, maturities, and sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offse\nt by $315 million of proceeds from government incentives to offset capital expenditures.\nFor 2023, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $7.68 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by $710 million of proceeds from government incentives to offset capital expenditures, and $868 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities.\nFinancing Activities:\n For 2025, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of $4.62 billion of repayments of debt, which included the prepayment of the 2026 Notes, 2026 Term Loan A, 2027 Notes, 2027 Term Loan A, and a portion of the 2029 Term Loan A borrowings; and $522 million for payments of dividends to shareholders; partially offset by approximately $4.43 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Term Loan A, 2032 Notes, 2035 A Notes, and 2035 B Notes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12. Debt.\nFor 2024, net cash used for financing activi\nties consisted primarily of $1.90 billion of repayments of debt, which included the prepayment of the 2024 Term Loan A and the 2025 Term Loan A borrowings, $513 million for paym\nents of dividends to shareholders, \n$300 million\n for the acquisition of 3.2 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, an\nd $149 million of\n payments on equipment purchase contracts, partially offset by approximately $1.00 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Notes.\nFor 2023, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $3.20 billion of proceeds from our 2025, 2026, and 2027 Term Loan A borrowings, $1.27 billion from the issuance of the 2029 B Notes, $896 million from the issuance of the 2033 B Notes, $749 million from the issuance of the 2033 A Notes, and $599 million from the issuance of the 2028 Notes. Cash used for financing activities included $761 million for repayments of debt, $504 million for payments of dividends to shareholders, $425 million for the acquisition of 8.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, and $138 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions and involve a significant level of uncertainty. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\n \n58\nTable of Contents\nContingencies:\n \nWe are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of potential losses. An accrual is made when a potential loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. When accounting for the resolution of contingencies, significant judgment may be necessary to determine whether losses pertain to previous, current, or future periods impacting the recognition timing to results of operations.\nGoodwill:\n We test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired, and we are not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value. We recognized a charge of $101 million in 2023 to impair all of the goodwill assigned to our former Storage Business Unit reporting unit based on our quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of reorganizing our segments in the fourth quarter of 2025, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each of our reporting units immediately before and after our business unit reorganization. We concluded based on both our pre- and post-reorganization impairment tests that goodwill was not impaired. \nDetermining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, and other expenses and are developed as part of our long-range planning process. The same estimates are used in business planning, forecasting, and capital budgeting as part of our long-term manufacturing capacity analysis. These estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to estimate a fair value. The discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. We base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We assess the reasonableness of our methodology, forecasts, and assumptions by comparing the aggregate calculated fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization.\nGovernment incentives:\n We receive incentives from governmental entities related to capital expenditures, expenses, and other activities. The government incentives we receive may require that we meet or maintain specified spending levels and other operational metrics and may be subject to reimbursement if such conditions are not met or maintained. Failure to comply with these terms and conditions could result in termination of incentive programs or clawbacks of incentive amounts received. \nGovernment incentives are recognized in the financial statements based on the underlying principal criteria for earning the incentives when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions of the government incentives are met and the incentive will be received. Incentives related to the acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amounts of the related assets and as a reduction of subsequent depreciation expense over the useful lives of the assets. Incentives related to specific operating activities are offset against the related expense in the period the expense is incurred. For each project, we estimate the total expected project costs and recognize a proportionate benefit as qualified project costs are incurred. As the estimated total expected qualified project cost changes, we adjust our estimate of the recognized proportionate benefit.\n59 |\n \n2025 10-K\nTable of Contents\nIncome taxes:\n We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires an assessment of our performance and other relevant factors. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. Our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in Japan, Malaysia, the United States, and other jurisdictions. Such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.\nInventories:\n \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis. Cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories involves significant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, future sales volumes, and future cost per part. To project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, and general economic trends. To project cost per part, we review trends and historical results and consider known changes in our cost structure as applicable. Actual selling prices may vary significantly from projected prices due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets. When these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold. As a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to costs of goods sold can vary significantly. Differences in future average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded. For example, a 5% decrease in future average selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our finished goods and work in process inventories by approximately $750 million as of August 28, 2025.\nU.S. GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values. The amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. We review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories (including DRAM, NAND, and other memory) as a single group.\nProperty, plant, and equipment:\n \nWe periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment based on technology node transitions, capital spending, and equipment re-use rates. We also review the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. The estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products, and future production and sales volumes. \nRevenue recognition:\n Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Contracts with our customers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical returns. In addition, we generally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends, to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue.\n \n60\nTable of Contents\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nSee Item 8.
