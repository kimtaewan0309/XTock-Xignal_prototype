Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments. It is an important element of our corporate strategy to provide choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for customers transitioning to cloud-based IT environments.\nOracle Cloud Applications (OCA) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI, collectively with OCA, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services, enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Oracle Cloud Services integrate IT components in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys and manages for customers and is accessible by utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices. Oracle Cloud Services are designed to be:\n•\nrapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; \n•\nintuitive for casual and experienced users; \n•\neasily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; \n•\nconnectable among differing deployment models to enable interoperability and extensibility to easily move workloads among the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; \n•\ncost-effective by lowering upfront customer investments and implementing usage-based resource consumption costs; and \n•\nhighly secure, standards-based and reliable.\nOracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own IT environments. Substantially all customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n \nOracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n \nOracle also offers professional services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services.\nOur customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force or indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations, including, for example, an artificial intelligence (AI) product company that uses OCI to build and serve generative AI models; a global technology company that uses multiple OCI compute and data services to power its logistics and mobile application offerings; a multinational financial institution that runs its banking applications using Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for its accounting processes, risk management, supply chain and financial planning functions.\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, we invested $9.9 billion, $8.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\ntechnologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another, including using OCI to power our OCA, which we and our customers use to run internal business processes. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, reliability, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors; facilitating the ease with which organizations are able to deploy, use, manage and maintain our offerings; and incorporating emerging technologies, such as AI, within our offerings to enable leaner business processes, automation and innovation.\n \nAfter an initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us.\n \nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings and increase stockholder value. We have invested billions of dollars over time to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies as suitable opportunities arise to further our corporate strategy.\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services. Each business is comprised of a single operating segment. Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments.\nOracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\nOracle Applications and Infrastructure Technologies\nOracle applications and infrastructure technologies, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and services, are based upon industry standards and are designed to be enterprise-grade, reliable, scalable and secure.

Rapid technological advances in cloud, software and hardware development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to develop new products and services offerings, as well as maintain and improve our current offerings.\n \nHuman Capital Resources\nAt Oracle, our success is driven by the quality of our people, who we believe are among the best and brightest in the industry. We strive to attract and retain talented employees, to support our employees’ success and well-being and to foster a culture of inclusion where everyone is empowered to have a voice in driving innovation. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) is responsible for reviewing and monitoring matters related to human capital management, including talent acquisition and retention.\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWorkforce\nAs of May 31, 2025, we employed approximately 162,000 full-time employees, of which approximately 58,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 104,000 were employed internationally. Our approximate employee counts by lines of business are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCloud services and license support operations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nServices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSales and marketing\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHardware\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n\n\n\nThe average tenure of our employees is approximately eight years and 30% of our employees have been employed with Oracle for ten or more years.\nNone of our employees in the U.S. are represented by labor unions; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our employees.\nEmployee Experience\nIn order to attract and retain high quality talent, Oracle strives to deliver a great employee experience, anchored by an inclusive culture where employees can thrive, engage in meaningful work, leverage growth opportunities and focus on their well-being. We support employee well-being from multiple dimensions, including flexible benefits, economic, health, development, lifestyle and compensation.\nWe believe that one of the primary reasons candidates join Oracle is for the opportunity to develop their career and participate in our global inclusive culture. We have programs and resources to help our employees explore, build and achieve their career goals. By promoting an inclusive culture that leverages a broad range of perspectives and fosters a sense of belonging, we inspire and engage our workforce to solve complex problems to help our customers across the globe.\n \nWe promote regular career conversations between leaders and employees, focused on helping employees identify and take steps to grow their careers. Our Talent Review process, which runs on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM, provides the mechanism for leaders to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees. 29% of our open non-entry level positions were filled internally in fiscal 2025, providing growth opportunities and retaining critical knowledge and talent.\nWe believe that helping our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining and engaging them. It is also critical to our ability to innovate and rapidly evolve. We believe that our easily accessible learning resources enable us to improve our employees’ learning experience and better measure learning consumption. Oracle employees received more than 4.7 million hours of training in fiscal 2025 and accessed online learning content at an average rate of approximately 2.5 million views per month. Our employees take advantage of instructor-led classes, virtual library content and online learning resources on sales, business, product, market/industry, leadership, technical and compliance skills, well-being and personal development related topics.\nLeaders Who Listen\nWe believe that an important aspect of creating a workforce that supports employee, customer and business success is listening to employee feedback. We share the results of our annual employee engagement survey with leaders, including members of our Board of Directors (the Board). In fiscal 2025, 83% of our employees participated in the annual survey. Leaders listen to employees, evaluate feedback and prioritize actions to enhance employee, business and customer success.\nMaking a Difference\nEach year, through our volunteering and giving programs, Oracle employees donate tens of thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars (matched by Oracle) to a wide variety of causes. Oracle and our employees also rise to the occasion in times of crisis.\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, Oracle donated tens of millions of dollars to advance education, promote health, strengthen communities and protect the environment. We also have two nonprofit foundations that focus on children and young people. Oracle Health Foundation makes pediatric case grants available globally that fund medical care ranging from hearing aids to major surgeries. Oracle Education Foundation teaches young people how to innovate, solve problems with technology and shape a better future. Since 2014, Oracle has partnered with Design Tech High School, a public charter school for which we built a home at our Redwood Shores, California campus in 2016.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nOur quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the IT industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. See “Cloud and License Business” in Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of the revenues, expenses and margins of our cloud and license business, which is our largest business.\nCompetition\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.\nOur customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments. Our enterprise cloud, license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Adobe Systems Incorporated, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Intel Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Salesforce, Inc. and SAP SE, as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. For example, following our acquisition of Cerner Corporation, we also face competition from large healthcare IT providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Arcadia Solutions, athenahealth, Inc., Epic Systems Corporation and InterSystems Corporation, among others. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions—including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lines—which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories.\n \nKey competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our products and services sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors:\n•\nmarket adoption of cloud-based IT offerings, including Oracle Cloud Services offerings;\n•\nour ability to develop AI technologies and features and to have access to AI technologies of competitors; \n•\nthe ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings;\n•\ncompatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle Cloud environments;\n•\nthe broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;\n•\noperating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems;\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n•\nthe adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers;\n•\nproducts, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; \n•\nproducts, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and\n•\nthe attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.\nFor more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n \nGovernmental Regulation\nWe operate globally and are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. For information about governmental regulations applicable to our business, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available, free of charge, on the SEC website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish them to, the SEC.

The following discussion, as well as our discussion in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products and services, integrating acquired products and services and enhancing our existing products and services.\n   Our industry is characterized by rapid technological advances, intense competition, changing delivery models, evolving standards in communications infrastructure, increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services, but if we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to our future success. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.\nIn addition, our business may be adversely affected if:\n•\nwe do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;\n•\ninfrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated;\n•\nsupply chain costs, energy costs or other costs to develop, produce or distribute our products and services result in greater costs than anticipated;\n•\nwe are unable to accurately anticipate, plan for and manage future data center capacity needs in a timely manner to meet current or expected customer demand;\n•\nwe fail to meet our contractual service level commitments;\n•\nthere is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new, enhanced or acquired product lines or services;\n•\nsanctions, tariffs, export controls, geopolitical instability and related market disruptions or other regulatory, legislative or other trade and non-tariff barriers, including retaliatory measures, impede or prevent us from serving certain customers or restrict our customers from operating in specific jurisdictions;\n•\ninflation, trade policy, geopolitical conditions and other macroeconomic factors reduce customer demand for our products and services or cause us to be unable to meet current or expected customer demand;\n•\nthere are changes in IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or timely address with our product development efforts;\n•\nwe do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner; or\n•\nwe fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.\nIn addition, our profitability and revenues could be adversely impacted if we lose one or more of our key customers for any reason, including as a result of any of the factors discussed above. Any such loss could also limit or reduce our growth in future periods.\nOur AI products may not operate as anticipated, which could adversely affect our reputation, revenues and profitability.\n   Machine learning and AI, including generative AI, agentic AI and LLMs, are increasingly driving innovations in technology, and AI technology and services are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources to build and support our AI products. In addition, we rely on partners and suppliers to produce some of our AI products. If we are unable to introduce new AI products or if our AI products fail to operate as anticipated or as well as competing products or otherwise do not meet customer needs, or if our competitors’ AI products achieve higher market acceptance than ours, we may fail to\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nrecoup our investments in AI and our business and reputation may be harmed. Further, if we do not continue to invest significant resources to develop and support our AI products, we may fall behind technological developments and evolving industry standards, which would likewise harm our ability to compete. In addition, AI technologies are rapidly changing and present evolving legal, regulatory and ethical issues, including claims of bias, discrimination, a perceived lack of transparency, as well as sometimes unpredictable behaviors or improper use of copyrighted or other protected material, such as personal and patient health information, any of which could expose us or our customers to reputational or legal risk and inhibit adoption of our AI products. Regulatory uncertainty, including the lack of comprehensive federal legislation and a patchwork of existing and proposed frameworks and regulatory initiatives in numerous jurisdictions, may expose us to compliance challenges and uncertainties. Our failure to adapt to these changes, or any failure by our employees, contractors, partners, suppliers or agents to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our AI products or our related policies and procedures, could result in legal, financial and reputational consequences including, but not limited to, being required to adjust or limit our product offerings or our use of AI in certain jurisdictions to comply with new and evolving AI laws and regulations.\nIf we do not successfully execute our Oracle Cloud strategy, including our offerings of Oracle Cloud Services, our revenues and profitability may decline.\n   We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via a variety of deployment models, including via our cloud-based OCA and OCI offerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of various cloud offering models by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.\nAs customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on-premise license and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers predominantly purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis, and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably or as services are consumed over the terms of the subscriptions. Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statements of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transitions from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIf we are unable to secure data center capacity at affordable rates or do not accurately plan for and manage our infrastructure capacity requirements, our profitability may decline.\n   As a part of our Oracle Cloud strategy, we plan our investment levels based on estimates of future revenues and customer demand and future anticipated rates of growth. In recent periods, our cloud services and license support expenses have grown to meet current and expected demand for our cloud offerings, including investments to increase our existing data center capacity and to establish data centers in new geographic locations. In connection with these investments, we entered, and expect to continue to enter, into long-term lease commitments with third-party data center providers and other significant commitments with suppliers of chips and other data center infrastructure. If we underestimate customer demand or our data center capacity needs, we may face shortages of available infrastructure, limiting our ability to support customer growth and potentially causing us to lose business to competitors. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand or our data center capacity needs, we could be locked into multi-year commitments for excess data center space, resulting in lower profitability and cash flows because our third-party data center vendors generally require us to pay significant contract termination fees to early exit such obligations. Data centers in geographies that we rely on may also be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Moreover, we do not control the operation of these third-party data centers, and they may suffer interruptions in service from events beyond our control, including from acts of government, natural events, power loss, break-ins or misconduct by those third parties. We have faced, and may continue to face, rising costs for data center energy demands. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers to provide equipment and components required to outfit these data centers on a timely basis. Ongoing or future delays or the inability to meet customer demand could cause the loss of additional sales, delay our revenue recognition or increase our costs, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our business. We typically depreciate these assets over their estimated useful lives, which could be shortened should our cloud strategies change, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nOur products and services may not function properly if we experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings.\n \nDespite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configuration errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings, or errors embedded in third-party software products or services incorporated into our own products, can affect their ability to properly function, integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings; result in service interruptions, delays or outages of our cloud offerings; create security vulnerabilities in our products or services; delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services; and adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. If we experience any of these errors, or if there are delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our and our customers’ abilities to conduct business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs and interruptions. Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses, and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.\n   We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change. Our enterprise cloud, license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, many of which have well-developed customer bases and strong brand recognition. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new, agile and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. We believe many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence, compute, storage and networking products, among others, which compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings.\n \nIn addition, use of our competitors’ technologies can influence a customer’s purchasing decision or create an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services. For example, we offer our customers multicloud services whereby our customers can combine cloud services from multiple clouds with the goal of optimizing cost, functionality and performance. OCI’s multicloud services work with a number of our competitors’ products, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. This multicloud strategy could lead our customers to migrate away from our cloud offerings to our competitors’ products or limit their purchases of additional Oracle products, either of which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur competitors may also seek to attract or retain customers who might otherwise purchase our products and services by offering competing products and services on terms that we may not generally find acceptable. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more flexible business practices, provide debt or equity financing to customers or form strategic alliances with other companies. Mergers, consolidations or alliances among our competitors, or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies, may result in increased competition.\n \nIf our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings or offer other terms that are less favorable to us to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license, hardware and services offerings, and we have incurred increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure, all of which could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products, changes in customer demand or increased competition, our revenues could decrease.\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results\n.   Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues related to our applications and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services or resolve issues efficiently. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or even the perception that our support is insufficient, could adversely affect our reputation, hinder our ability to sell and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and negatively impact our business, operating results and financial position.\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.\n   Developing our various product offerings is expensive and the return on investment is often long. An important element of our corporate strategy is to commit significant resources to research and development, as well as related product and service opportunities, both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from acquired companies. Accelerated product and service introductions and short lifecycles require high levels of research and development spending, which could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that continued investment in research and development is essential to maintaining our competitive position. However, our investments in research and development may fail to yield competitive products and services and we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the sourcing of technologies and components, the results of these businesses will suffer.\n \nWe depend on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations are affected by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest (such as the tensions between China and Taiwan), public health crises, changes to trade laws or regulations, tariffs and customs controls, port stoppages, shipping interruptions or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, and other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If disruption caused by one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher purchases and balances of hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, relative to our historical positions. For example, industry supply capacity for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units, is competitive, and we at times have to accept less favorable terms with suppliers to avoid supply constraints. While this permits us to secure cloud infrastructure capacity, it has increased excess and obsolescence risk of such hardware products and could adversely impact our profitability and cash flows. We expect these factors will continue to impact us in the future.\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. From time to time, these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products on a timely or cost-effective basis, including as a result of changes to trade laws or regulations, tariffs, sanctions and export or import controls. Ongoing or future delays or cost increases in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive.\n   We periodically restructure or make other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity while employees adjust to the restructuring. These types of restructurings may also lead to shortages of sufficiently skilled employees in certain roles, loss of valuable institutional knowledge and damage to employee morale and retention.\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nHiring freezes or slowdowns can also result in decreased productivity while existing employees take on additional roles and responsibilities, and may also lead to a shortage of sufficiently skilled employees in certain roles. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within our expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings, and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.\n   We rely on hiring qualified employees and retaining our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other executive team members; and key employees. In the technology industry, especially in the AI field, competition for highly skilled business, product development and technical personnel is intense and ongoing.\n \nWe may also face rising compensation costs without corresponding gains in productivity or sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and any future departures may be disruptive to our operations.\nTo manage expenses, we hire personnel in countries where advanced technical and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We are experiencing increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which has affected our employee retention efforts and increased our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.\nOur general compensation program includes restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based equity, which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price stagnates or declines, our ability to retain or attract employees may be harmed. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\nThere are risks associated with our cloud and license and hardware indirect sales channels which could affect our future operating results.\n   Our cloud and license and hardware indirect channel networks consist primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and ISVs. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if:\n \n•\nour contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate;\n•\nany of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant; \n•\nthe financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken; or \n•\nthe level of demand for our channel participants’ products and services were to decrease. \nWe may not successfully maintain, expand or develop our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. In addition, we do not control channel participants, some of whom operate in jurisdictions with elevated corruption risks. Our compliance policies and procedures may fail to prevent or detect violations of anti-corruption or other laws, and channel participants may violate such laws, all of which could subject us to litigation or regulatory risk and result in liability.\n \nAcquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.\n   We regularly review and consider strategic acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies as a part of our corporate strategy, and we expect to continue making acquisitions in the future. However, our strategic acquisition program carries several risks, including but not limited to:\n•\nbusiness disruption and management distraction due to acquisition, transition or integration activities;\n•\nchallenges in managing acquired technologies or lines of business, entering new markets where we have no, or limited, direct prior experience or market positions, or retaining key personnel from the acquired companies;\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n•\nacquisitions that do not meet strategic expectations, including due to difficulties integrating acquired companies, negative impacts from imposed business practices or different go-to-market strategies, and the risk of overpaying or failing to realize expected returns on our investments, each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition, including intangible assets and goodwill;\n•\nnegative financial impacts from (1) assumed claims or liabilities; (2) assumed costly or disruptive pre-existing contractual relationships; and (3) unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company’s business practices;\n•\nfailure to identify or accurately assess significant liabilities or shortcomings prior to finalization of an acquisition;\n•\nfailure to realize expected revenue growth from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including (1) more customers than expected declining to renew or terminating their contracts; (2) difficulty selling acquired products or service offerings to our customer base; (3) acquired customers declining to purchase our technologies due to differing business practices; or (4) contract models utilized by an acquired company conflicting with our revenue recognition methods;\n•\nintegration difficulties, including aligning acquired compliance programs, technologies, products, services, supply chain operations, environmental practices or infrastructure with our existing lines of business;\n•\nproduct and service inconsistencies across multiple product lines or services offerings, leading to customer confusion and delays;\n•\nhigher than anticipated costs related to supporting, developing and delivering acquired products or services, expanding general and administrative functions for new business models or complying with complex regulations applicable to an acquired business;\n•\nlabor challenges, including difficulties obtaining timely approvals from works councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws;\n•\nregulatory and judicial challenges, including delays or restrictions from governmental authorities under foreign direct investment, foreign subsidy, competition and antitrust laws, potentially requiring asset divestitures, other concessions or a termination of the acquisition process;\n•\nlimitations on our potential other uses for our cash; and\n•\nfinancial constraints that may require us to incur additional debt to pay for acquisitions or delay or not proceed with an acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.\nWe are subject to risks with respect to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.\n   We are subject to evolving, and sometimes conflicting, laws, regulations, policies and stakeholder expectations relating to matters beyond our core products and services, including ESG matters, such as environmental sustainability, climate change, human capital and workforce matters. The Nomination and Governance Committee of our Board oversees and periodically reviews our ESG programs and our management evaluates if climate or environmental risks could significantly impact our core or strategic business functions, including service delivery and support, product development and deployment, supply chain management, facility operations, employee recruitment and retention or brand reputation. Any failure to identify and address these risks could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth.\nFurther, in an effort to be responsive to customer, employee and other stakeholder interests and expectations, we publicly disclose certain ESG-related goals and statistics. If we fail to meet these goals, or are perceived as failing to meet our ESG goals, our revenues, reputation and brand may be harmed. In addition, views on ESG and related matters diverge within and among different stakeholder groups, including stockholders, customers and employees, as well as government actors. Efforts to meet evolving and increasingly divergent stakeholder expectations on ESG and related matters may place a strain on our employees and systems, and if we are targeted by those who disagree with our public positions on ESG and related issues, or if we do not otherwise successfully manage ESG-related expectations across our stakeholders, it could erode stakeholder trust, impact our reputation or subject us to litigation, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nData Privacy, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property Risks\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers’ data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, any of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.\n   Our products and services, including Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, process and manage third-party data, such as our customers’ data, as well as our own data. We believe that Oracle has been and is a target for computer hackers, cyberattacks and other perpetrators or threat actors because Oracle stores and processes large amounts of data, including sensitive data such as health sciences (including patient health information), financial services, retail, hospitality, telecommunications and government data. We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties (which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation-states and individuals sponsored by them) to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers’, partners’ and suppliers’ software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. Such malicious attacks can lead, and have led, to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Attempts of this nature typically involve IT-related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of networks, systems, products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other credentials to gain access to our data, our customers’, suppliers’ or partners’ data or the IT systems of Oracle, our customers, suppliers or partners. Our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud Services, may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee, contractor or supplier error or malfeasance.\nWhen a cyberattack or other security event or incident results in unauthorized access to, or modification or exfiltration of, our customers’ or suppliers’ data, other external data, our own data or our IT systems, or if the services we provide to our customers are disrupted, or if our products or services are reported to have (or are perceived as having) security vulnerabilities, we have incurred and could incur significant expenses and could suffer substantial damage to our brand and reputation. If our customers lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, they may reduce or terminate their spending with us. In addition, cyberattacks and other security events or incidents have resulted and could result in: significant investigation and remediation costs; loss or destruction of data; operational disruptions; inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data; lawsuits; indemnity obligations; regulatory investigations and financial penalties; and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs for customer notification and fraud monitoring. Our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n \nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems, constantly evolve, grow more complex over time, and often are not detected until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques. Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with emerging threats. We may not detect or confirm any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach.\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on a wide variety of third-party products, components and services. If a security vulnerability exists in one of these components, a targeted exploit could lead to increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection.\n   As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex and stringent, potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify. In addition, U.S. federal and state as well as foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer (including across national borders) and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. We are also subject to data privacy and other related regulations governing the healthcare industry and patient information, including but not limited to regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, the processing of patient information, healthcare fraud and healthcare information sharing.\nFollowing the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased, giving rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle, and if we are not deemed to be in compliance, could result in enforcement actions and/or fines. This is true in the U.S. where, for example, a number of states have enacted privacy laws, the U.S. Congress has been considering several privacy and security-related bills at the federal level, the federal government is pursuing a range of cybersecurity initiatives pertaining to critical infrastructure companies and government contractors, and a number of other state legislatures have passed or are considering privacy laws. Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. The GDPR provides for monetary penalties of up to €20 million, or up to 4% of an organization’s worldwide revenue of the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. These penalties can be significant. For example, a U.S.-based technology company was fined €1.2 billion for alleged GDPR violations in 2023. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues to fine companies for unfair and deceptive data protection practices, and these fines may increase in size. Taken together, the laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection, and our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we have implemented contracts, diligence programs, policies and procedures designed to address compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts, policies and procedures. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products and services. For example, numerous jurisdictions, including the EU, have passed or are considering laws and regulations that would impose additional data privacy and other compliance requirements on the use of AI and could require us to adjust or limit our product offerings in such jurisdictions.\nWe make statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy, information provided on our website and press statements. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.\nThird parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.\n   We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, third parties claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property for the sole purpose of monetization through infringement assertions. We expect to continue to receive such claims as:\n•\nwe continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies;\n•\nthe number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows;\n•\nthe use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry;\n•\nthe use of AI and support of LLMs becomes more prevalent in the industry;\n•\nthe volume of issued patents continues to increase; and\n•\nnon-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments.\nResponding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:\n \n•\nbe time consuming, costly and result in litigation;\n•\ndivert management’s time and attention from developing our business;\n•\nrequire us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n•\nrequire us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products;\n•\nrequire us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms;\n•\nrequire us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or\n•\notherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\n   We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or otherwise use our intellectual property. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the claim scope we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection as U.S. laws and courts. If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nAdverse litigation results could affect our business.\n   We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management’s attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. Even favorable judgments have been, and may in the future be, subject to appeals leading to protracted litigation, additional costs and the prospect that our desired outcome will be overturned. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe may be subjected to increased taxes due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws or from adverse resolutions of tax audits and controversies.\n   As a multinational corporation, we incur income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, property and value-added taxes) in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the application of the various taxes to the businesses in which we engage, often requiring that we make judgments in determining our tax liabilities and worldwide provision for income taxes. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in the U.S. and internationally, which has led to disagreements regarding our treatment of various items, including our intercompany transfer prices and calculations and the applicability of withholding taxes to our cross-border transactions. Any unfavorable resolution of these tax audits and controversies could cause our tax liabilities to increase and may have a material and adverse impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. Although we believe that our income and non-income-based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and tax accruals.\nCountries around the world continually consider and make changes to relevant tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, guidance and interpretations. For example, the U.S. Congress is considering extending tax provisions enacted as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as making other changes to federal tax law, some of which could have an adverse impact on us. Various other legislative proposals, if enacted, could substantially raise U.S. income taxes on our domestic and international profits. Such unfavorable tax proposals create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have a material adverse impact on our future income tax provisions and effective tax rate.\nOther countries also continue to consider changes to their tax laws that could negatively affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our international revenue streams, operations and cross-border transactions, including the imposition of taxes targeted at digital technology businesses and changes in withholding tax rules. A project led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries including the U.S., over the last several years has resulted in changes to the basic design of the international tax system, including the implementation of a 15% minimum tax in over 50 countries, as well as proposed changes that would provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located. There can be no assurance that these enacted changes, which are subject to ongoing OECD guidance and interpretations by the various adopting countries, and any contemplated changes, if implemented by countries, will not materially increase the level of income tax on our international profits.\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nOur future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase under the tax changes discussed above or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, fluctuations in our stock price and level of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.\nOur international sales and operations and global customer base subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.\n   We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S., and in both our U.S. and non-U.S. operations we serve customers based in or with ties to numerous jurisdictions around the world. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition/antitrust regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in monetary fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, enforcement actions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including disgorgement, the loss of trade privileges, and other remedial measures. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries or territories or to certain entities, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\n \nChanges to sanctions or export control regulations in the U.S. and the other jurisdictions where we currently operate or have dealings, or in the future may operate or have dealings, can require suspension or termination of business (including financial transactions) in or with certain countries and territories or with certain customers. In addition, we continue to closely monitor international relations and it is difficult to anticipate the effect geopolitical developments may have on us. Compliance with any further sanctions, export controls or other regulatory restrictions (and any countermeasures thereto) taken by the U.S. or other countries could prevent us from serving certain customers or restrict us or our customers from operating in specific jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations. For example, the U.S. enacted a law making it unlawful, beginning in January 2025, to provide internet hosting services to TikTok that are used to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of TikTok for users within the U.S. The President issued executive orders that prohibit enforcement until a future date, and also prohibit the imposition of penalties at any time for providing services during the time period covered by the prohibition of enforcement, and ordered the Attorney General to notify relevant service providers that continuing to provide services during the prohibition of enforcement does not violate the statute. If the prohibition is lifted or expires without a resolution that satisfies relevant legal requirements, we may no longer be able to provide those services to TikTok, and if we cannot redeploy that capacity in a timely manner, our revenues and profits would be adversely impacted.\n \nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks. We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where warranted, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities who may conduct their own investigations, and we respond to their requests or demands for information. No assurance can be given that such authorities will not take action or that our compliance program will prove effective. There is no guarantee that our compliance policies and procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent all violations of laws, including economic and financial sanction laws and embargoes. In addition, we are currently navigating a period of geopolitical and regulatory volatility.\nWe face a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to:\n \n•\ngeneral economic conditions in each country or region;\n•\npolitical unrest, terrorism and war, including but not limited to the current Russia-Ukraine war and its potential economic and geopolitical impacts on Europe, where a material portion of our business is carried out;\n•\nthe potential for other hostilities, including but not limited to further destabilization in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n•\npublic health, social and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations;\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n•\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results;\n•\ndifficulties in accessing or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular our cash assets, in that country’s currency;\n•\nregulatory changes, including unexpected government austerity measures in certain countries that may impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries;\n•\ncommon local business behaviors or regulatory requirements that conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies;\n•\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n•\noverlapping tax regimes; and\n•\nweaker protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThe variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our supply chain operations and sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.\nAs the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly traded company in Japan, we face several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entities were wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated, and thus, we are subject to several laws, regulations and industry initiatives, non-compliance with certain of which could adversely affect our healthcare business.\n   As a participant in the healthcare industry, certain of our operations and relationships, and those of our customers, are regulated by several U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. These regulations impact us both directly and indirectly, in terms of government program requirements applicable to our customers for the use of health IT. Even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products and services must be capable of being used by our customers in a way that complies with those laws and regulations. There are significant, wide-ranging and rapidly evolving regulations worldwide, covering healthcare fraud, information sharing, e-prescribing, medical claims processing and transmission, healthcare devices, the use of AI in healthcare, the security and privacy of patient data and interoperability standards, that may be directly or indirectly applicable to our operations and relationships or the business practices of our customers. Specific risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nMedical device regulations in the U.S. and other countries may now or in the future apply to certain of our healthcare products and services. If any of our healthcare products and services are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by regulatory agencies in countries where we do business, we could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing activities, including pre-market notification clearance or recalls.\n•\nCertified electronic health record technology (CEHRT) requirements continue to evolve and remain necessary to participate in federal healthcare programs in order to receive reimbursement for health items and services provided by certain of our customers to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We expect the regulations establishing the certification and interoperability standards for CEHRT will continue to be updated to emphasize interoperability, consumer engagement, patient safety and health information privacy and security.\nComplying with these regulations globally is expensive and could subject us to unanticipated and significant delays. If we fail to comply sufficiently with these and other regulations, it could negatively impact our ability to continue to develop, distribute and deliver certain of our healthcare products and services, and we could suffer fines or penalties.\nOur sales to local, state, federal and foreign government customers expose us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, government shutdowns, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.\n   We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws relating to the award, administration and performance of those contracts.\nGovernmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services. Changes in government procurement policy, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and/or requirements may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector. For example, the U.S. government imposes\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nevolving cybersecurity requirements, including, for example, the FedRAMP authorization process and the Department of Defense (DoD) Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. These requirements may impact our lines of business in the U.S. federal government market. Compliance with these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly, and any failure or alleged failure to meet, or delays in meeting, the required security controls could result in liability, limit our ability to sell products and services, directly or indirectly, to the DoD and other federal and state government entities that implement similar cybersecurity requirements and adversely affect our reputation and sales.\nWe are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time for a variety of reasons, including without cause. For example, the U.S. federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience, or for default based on our performance. U.S. federal, state and local government and foreign government contracts are generally subject to government funding authorizations/appropriations. Contracts may also be terminated due to a lack of government funds.\nThere is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending as governments continue to face significant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs and result in termination of government contracts, delays in contract awards and pausing of payments during cost efficiency reviews. In addition, an extended federal government shutdown in the U.S. could cause delays in approvals and decision making, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nGovernment contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and certain of our government contracts and contracting practices are currently, and may in the future be, subject to audits and investigations. Any violations of law or alleged violations of law could subject us to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of fees received, treble damages, settlement payments, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business, as well as adverse publicity and reputational damage.\nEnvironmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\n   Our cloud and hardware operations are subject to extensive, evolving and sometimes inconsistent state, federal and international regulations related to ESG matters. Some of these regulations establish specific metrics, targets, and disclosure frameworks for a variety of ESG issues, including environmental sustainability, supply chain labor practices, workforce health and safety, proper handling and disposal of certain chemicals and materials, and local testing and labeling requirements. Regulatory, market, carbon tax and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations have increased and are expected to continue to increase.\nCompliance with these ever-changing and sometimes divergent ESG laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations, insurance premiums and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Failure to comply with these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services in certain regions. Additionally, new or updated regulated disclosure requirements could result in revisions to our previous ESG-related disclosure, which could expose us to liability or reputational harm.\nFinancial Risks\nOur operations can be difficult for us to predict because our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors.   \nOur revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. A substantial portion of our cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. We typically have a number of large transactions each quarter, which increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results. If we lose one or more of our key customers for any reason, or we experience a delay in even a small number of these large transactions, our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability could fall significantly short of our predictions. In addition, sudden shifts in regional or global economic or political activity may cause our sales forecasts to be inaccurate.\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIn addition, we hold a portfolio of marketable and non-marketable debt and equity investments, including investments in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a privately held related party entity in which we had an ownership interest of approximately 29% as of May 31, 2025. Any impairment charges and effect of changes in the fair values of certain of these investments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses as a component of consolidated net income in each period. The timing and amount of impairment charges or changes in fair value, if any, of these investments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies or funds in which we invest, and are also subject to the general conditions of public and private equity markets, which are uncertain and have in the past varied, and may in the future vary, materially by period. Changes in the fair values of these investments, including Ampere, have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to volatility in our net income that is not reflective of our core businesses.\nOn March 19, 2025, SoftBank Group Corp. announced that it had entered into an agreement with Ampere and certain of its equity holders to acquire all of the equity interests of Ampere (the Ampere Acquisition). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, that are beyond our control. If the Ampere Acquisition closes, we will cease to be an investor in Ampere. During the period prior to closing the Ampere Acquisition, the amount of our investments in Ampere could increase for a variety of reasons and we will continue to recognize our share of loss in Ampere’s net earnings until the closure of the acquisition. If the Ampere Acquisition does not close, we will continue to be exposed to the risk associated with our investments in Ampere as discussed above.\nChanges in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability.\n \nWe conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, particularly the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and Saudi Riyal, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth by reducing the U.S. Dollar value of our foreign currency earnings and affecting actual demand for our products and services as they may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. Currency variations can also negatively impact profit margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, a stronger U.S. Dollar adversely affects, and a weaker U.S. Dollar favorably affects, our reported revenues and operating results. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies and reported in U.S. Dollars.\nIn addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations is international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, including the cost to obtain such contracts. For example, we experience foreign currency gains and losses when it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, our hedging efforts are ineffective or we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and any related fees paid to purchase such contracts, and other factors. All of these factors can from time to time materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar. We could incur future losses in other countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary.\n \nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\n   As of May 31, 2025, we had an aggregate of $92.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2025 and calendar year 2065. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nbusiness operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this Risk Factors section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\nWe have been refinancing portions of our outstanding debt as it matures and we may continue to do so in the future. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.\nShould we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes to our outlook or credit rating or a withdrawal by any rating agency could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.\n \nAll of the factors discussed within this Risk Factors section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new cloud services, AI advancements, products, product enhancements, technological advances, data center capacity, acquisitions or major transactions could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price. Our stock price could also be affected by factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others: speculation in the press, social media and the analyst community; changes in recommendations or earnings-related estimates by financial analysts; changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock; negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys; earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors’ expectations; our credit ratings; dissemination of inaccurate information or misinformation about our business and results of operations (including through the malicious use of generative AI tools); the enforcement or non-enforcement of laws and regulations; and market trends unrelated to our performance. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\n   Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Further, our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchase program may not enhance long-term stockholder value.\nGeneral Risks\nEconomic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price.\n    Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:\n \n•\ngeneral economic and business conditions;\n•\noverall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services;\n•\ngovernmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and\n•\ngeneral legal, regulatory and political developments.\nMacroeconomic developments such as the global or regional economic effects resulting from elevated inflation and interest rates, limited liquidity, adverse developments affecting financial institutions, the current wars, evolving trade policies between the U.S. and international trade partners, including the imposition of tariffs and other trade measures or restrictions, or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic, political or market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of, and related declining\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\ncorporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. If any parties with whom we conduct business or invest our cash or cash equivalents are unable to meet their obligations to us, our business could be adversely affected. Bank failures or issues in the broader U.S. or global financial systems may have an impact on the broader capital markets and, in turn, our ability to access those markets.\nIn addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, trade wars, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.\nBusiness disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\n \nA significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas, some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, including some of our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back-office processes. Although the Oracle Cloud is designed to automatically redirect traffic to an alternate facility, in the event of a severe impact to one facility, a major natural disaster, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as increased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations, supply chains or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.",
  "item7": "Item 7.\tManagement’s Discussion and Analysis o\nf Financial Condition and\n \nResults of Operations\nWe begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding significant assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\nBusiness Overview\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise IT needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\nCloud and License Business\n \nOur cloud and license business, which represented 86% and 84% of our total revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n•\nCloud services and license support revenues, which include:\no\ncloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements generally: are billed in advance of the cloud services being delivered; have durations of one to four years; are renewed at the customer’s option; and are recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time; and \no\nlicense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally: priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; billed in advance of the support services being performed; renewed at the customer’s option; and recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year.\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n•\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise or other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are recognized over time. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.\nProviding choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure software licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services revenues represented 43%, 37% and 32% of our total revenues during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nOur cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions, including the effects of inflation, tariffs and trade policy, geopolitical conditions and other macroeconomic factors on customer demand; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\n•\nexpected growth in our cloud services offerings; and\n•\ncontinued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings.\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\nOur cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base, which we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year, which we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods. Our margin for this business may be adversely impacted due to increases in supply chain and energy costs, the impact of tariffs and trade policy and other factors.\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nHardware Business\n \nOur hardware business, which represented 5% and 6% of our total revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to continue to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.\nWe generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.\n \nOur quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners’ abilities to timely and cost-effectively manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the pricing and position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions, including the effects of inflation, tariffs and trade policy, geopolitical conditions and other macroeconomic factors on customer demand; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts; the effect of tariffs and other trade barriers on our costs, and our ability to pass such costs on to customers; the geographic locations of our customers; the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nServices Business\n \nOur services business, which represented 9% and 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n \nAcquisitions\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\ntechnologies. As compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy.\nWe believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\nInvestment in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC\nFrom time to time since 2017, we have made investments in Ampere, a related party entity, in the form of equity and convertible debt instruments. The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere, after accounting for losses under the equity method of accounting, was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n \nOur equity investments in Ampere represent an ownership interest of approximately 29% as of May 31, 2025 and 2024. We also own convertible debt investments in Ampere which, under the terms of an agreement with Ampere and other co-investors, will mature in June 2026 and are convertible into equity securities at the holder’s option under certain circumstances. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, we invested an aggregate of $341 million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. In accordance with the terms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a counterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call (exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately $500 million to $1.5 billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity interests in Ampere from our co-investors through January 2027.\nOn March 19, 2025, SoftBank Group Corp. announced that it had entered into an agreement with Ampere and its equity holders to acquire all of the equity interests of Ampere. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. When the Ampere Acquisition closes, we will cease to be an investor in Ampere. During the period prior to the closing of the Ampere Acquisition, the amount of our investments in Ampere could increase for a variety of reasons and we will continue to recognize our share of loss in Ampere’s net earnings until the closure of the acquisition.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of income taxes and non-marketable investments. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nIncome Taxes\n \nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments.\n \nWe account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, \nIncome Taxes\n, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.\nNon-Marketable Investments\nWe assess our non-marketable debt and equity investments for credit losses and impairment on a quarterly basis and as facts and circumstances change. Our analysis includes an assessment of various qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee’s historical financial results, current financial projections, rate of cash usage and assumptions regarding product acceptance and opportunity within the market. This analysis requires significant judgment in evaluating underlying factors. In some instances, investee specific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is determined to be impaired, we adjust the carrying amount of such investment to its estimated fair value by recognizing a charge, which is included in non-operating income (expenses), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Estimating the fair value of an investment upon impairment involves a significant level of estimation, uncertainty and judgment. We may incur future losses due to impairments, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nResults of Operations\nPresentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information\n \nIn our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.\nIn addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, \nSegment Reporting\n. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.\nConsistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income (expenses), net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2025 and 2024.\nConstant Currency Presentation\nOur international operations have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2024, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2025 and 2024, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.13 million in fiscal 2025 (using 1.13 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period) and $1.09 million in fiscal 2024 (using 1.09 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2025 results using the fiscal 2024 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues between the periods compared. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nTotal Revenues and Operating Expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercent Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActual\n\n\n \n\n\nConstant\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenues by Geography\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n36,339\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10%\n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n33,122\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8%\n\n\n \n\n\n7%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,030\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,035\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3%\n\n\n \n\n\n5%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,809\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n57,399\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8%\n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n52,961\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Operating Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39,721\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6%\n\n\n \n\n\n6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37,608\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Operating Margin\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17,678\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15%\n\n\n \n\n\n16%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,353\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Operating Margin %\n\n\n \n\n\n31%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Revenues by Geography\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n63%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\n \n\n\n25%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenues by Business\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud and license\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n49,230\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n44,464\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,936\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,066\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,233\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n-3%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,431\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n57,399\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8%\n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n52,961\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Revenues by Business\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud and license\n\n\n \n\n\n86%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n84%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n \n\n\n5%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nComprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa \nTotal revenues increased by $4.4 billion in reported currency in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to a $4.8 billion increase in cloud and license revenues, partially offset by a $198 million decrease in services revenues and a $130 million decrease in hardware revenues, in each case during fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations of 1% in fiscal 2025 on total revenues, the constant currency increase in our cloud and license business revenues was primarily due to growth in our cloud services revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies and also renewed their related cloud contracts. In constant currency, applications cloud services and license support and infrastructure cloud services and license support contributed 26% and 74%, respectively, of the growth in cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2025. In our hardware business, the constant currency decrease in revenues in fiscal 2025 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies. In our services business, the constant currency decrease in revenues in fiscal 2025 was attributable to a decrease in revenues from each of our primary services offerings. The Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 74%, 19% and 7%, respectively, to the constant currency total revenue growth during fiscal 2025.\nTotal GAAP operating expenses increased by $2.1 billion in reported currency in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. The increase in GAAP operating expenses in reported currency during fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a $2.1 billion increase in cloud services and license support expenses primarily due to higher infrastructure expenses and higher employee-related expenses, including higher expenses relating to stock-based compensation, that were incurred to support the growth in our cloud services revenues; a $945 million increase in research and development expenses primarily due to an $813 million increase in employee-related expenses, including higher stock-based compensation expenses, and a $112 million increase in infrastructure expenses; a $377 million increase in sales and marketing expenses; and a $54 million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including higher stock-based compensation expenses. These increases in GAAP operating expenses in reported currency during fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 were partially offset by a $703 million decrease in expenses for the amortization of intangible assets as certain of our assets were fully amortized; a $249 million decrease in services expenses primarily due to decreases in external contractor and employee-related expenses; a $239 million decrease in acquisition related and other expenses due to lower asset impairment and litigation-related charges; a $109 million decrease in hardware expenses due to lower hardware product and support costs; and a $105 million decrease in restructuring expenses.\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIn constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to higher revenues.\nSupplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\nTo supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.\n \nOur operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expenses, including stock-based compensation, that affected our GAAP net income:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of intangible assets\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,307\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,010\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition related and other\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n314\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n299\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n404\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based compensation, operating segments\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,597\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,382\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based compensation, R&D and G&A\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,077\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,592\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax effects\n(5)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,514\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,459\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,841\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,243\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nRepresents the amortization of intangible assets, all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions.

Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one to four years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure software license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses and sales and marketing expenses.

These increases were partially offset by an $86 million decrease in license support revenues in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. In constant currency, applications cloud services and license support and infrastructure cloud services and license support contributed 26% and 74%, respectively, of the growth in cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2025. The Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 75%, 19% and 6%, respectively, to the constant currency revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2025.\nTotal cloud and license business’ expenses increased by $2.4 billion in reported currency in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. Excluding the favorable effects of currency rate fluctuations of less than 1% in fiscal 2025, the constant currency increase in expenses in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a $1.6 billion increase in infrastructure expenses; a $359 million increase in employee-related expenses for employees engaged in cloud services delivery; and a $350 million increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the increase in our cloud services revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods, and we expect this trend to continue during fiscal 2026 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.\nExcluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to increases in total revenues for this business. Total margin as a percentage of revenues in constant currency decreased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to an increase in total expenses for this business.\nHardware Business\nOur hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel-related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercent Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActual\n\n\n \n\n\nConstant\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware Revenues\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,441\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n-3%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,494\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n893\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-3%\n\n\n \n\n\n-3%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n921\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n602\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-8%\n\n\n \n\n\n-7%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n651\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,936\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,066\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenses\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware products and support\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n742\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-13%\n\n\n \n\n\n-12%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n855\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales and marketing\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n276\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-7%\n\n\n \n\n\n-6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n296\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expenses\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,018\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-12%\n\n\n \n\n\n-11%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,151\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Margin\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,918\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0%\n\n\n \n\n\n1%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,915\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Margin %\n\n\n \n\n\n65%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Revenues by Geography\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n49%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\n \n\n\n30%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n21%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nExcludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency rate fluctuations of less than 1% in fiscal 2025, the decrease in hardware revenues was primarily due to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Geographically, we experienced constant currency hardware revenue declines in all regions in fiscal 2025.\nTotal hardware expenses decreased by $133 million in reported currency in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. The decrease in hardware expenses aligned with lower hardware revenues. Excluding the favorable currency rate fluctuations effect of 1% in fiscal 2025, the constant currency decrease in hardware expenses during fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 was due to a $106 million decrease in hardware product and support costs and an $18 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses.\nIn constant currency, our hardware business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to lower total expenses for this business.\nServices Business\nOur services offerings are designed to help maximize the performance of customer investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies and include our consulting services and advanced customer services offerings.

These contributors to the increase in non-operating income (expenses), net were partially offset by a $77 million decrease in other income, net, which was primarily attributable to lower gains associated with an investment portfolio that we held for our employee deferred compensation plan, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n:\n \n \n \nOur effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned and losses incurred in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates.

Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax-related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercent Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActual\n\n\n \n\n\nConstant\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,717\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35%\n\n\n \n\n\n36%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,274\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n12.1%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.9%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 primarily due to an unfavorable jurisdictional mix of earnings of $380 million, the absence of the realization of a one-time tax attribute of $238 million, higher income before provision for income taxes of $195 million and the absence of the revaluation benefit of net deferred tax assets due to a change in tax rate of $105 million, partially offset by a combination of the absence of changes in unrecognized tax benefits of $233 million and an increase in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $223 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking capital\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(8,064\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n-10%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(8,990\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,203\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,661\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWorking capital\n:\n   The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2025 in comparison to May 31, 2024 was primarily due to favorable impacts from net income and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, net of issuance costs, of $13.9 billion (refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information) during fiscal 2025. This increase was partially offset by $21.2 billion of cash used for capital expenditures; $4.9 billion of long-term borrowings that were reclassified to current liabilities; $4.7 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders; $600 million of cash used for repurchases of our common stock; $294 million of cash used for purchases, net of sales and maturities of non-current investments; and $247 million of net cash used for our employee stock programs during fiscal 2025.

Our cash and cash equivalents may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20,821\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n18,673\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used for investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(21,711\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n195%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(7,360\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,098\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n*\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(10,554\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\nNot meaningful\n\n\n\n\nCash flows from operating activities\n:\n   Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their cloud services and license support agreements. Customers for these cloud services and license support agreements are generally billed in advance of services being provided. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also generate cash from the sales of new licenses, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee-related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.1 billion in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for certain non-cash charges, partially offset by certain cash unfavorable working capital changes, net.\nCash flows from investing activities\n:\n   The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our investments in capital assets primarily to support the growth in our cloud and license business and acquisitions, purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities and other instruments.\nNet cash used for investing activities increased by $14.4 billion in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures.\nCash flows from financing activities\n:\n   The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.\n \nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to the net cash used for financing activities of $10.6 billion in fiscal 2024. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, net of issuance costs, of $13.9 billion; higher issuances of commercial paper notes of $2.1 billion, net of repayments; lower net cash used for our employee stock programs of $1.1 billion; higher net cash provided by other financing activities of $1.1 billion; and lower net cash used for repurchases of common stock of $602 million. These increases were partially offset by higher scheduled repayments of borrowings of $6.7 billion and higher dividend payments of $352 million. Further, during fiscal 2025, we refinanced our term loan credit agreement that we entered into in fiscal 2023 (Term Loan Credit Agreement), which resulted in no net impact on financing cash flows for the period reported.\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFree cash flow\n:\n   To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with that of our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

In June 2025, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 24, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 10, 2025. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board.\nTerm Loan Credit Agreements\n:\n   On June 10, 2024, we terminated the Term Loan Credit Agreement and repaid the principal amount outstanding together with interest accrued up to the date of repayment. Simultaneously, we borrowed up to the maximum commitment amount of $5.6 billion pursuant to a term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement 2) executed on the same date. In fiscal 2025, we made scheduled repayments totaling $211 million of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our borrowings, including the repayment terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2. Any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 will become fully due and payable on August 16, 2027, unless the termination date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 is extended.\nSenior Notes\n:   \nDuring fiscal 2025, we issued $14.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes composed of the following:\n•\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due August 2028;\n•\n$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.80% senior notes due August 2028;\n•\n$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% senior notes due September 2029;\n•\n$1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due February 2032;\n•\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.70% senior notes due September 2034;\n•\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due August 2035;\n•\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due September 2054;\n•\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior notes due August 2055;\n•\n$1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due September 2064; and\n•\n$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due August 2065.\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe issued the senior notes to repay all or a portion of senior notes due between November 2024 and July 2026, and to pay accrued interest and any related premiums, fees and expenses in connection therewith; to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on borrowings under our Term Loan Credit Agreement 2; to repay all or a portion of commercial paper notes outstanding; and to use any remaining net proceeds from the borrowing for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of other indebtedness and future acquisitions. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\n:\n   Our Board has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May 31, 2025, approximately $6.4 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 3.9 million shares for $600 million, 10.6 million shares for $1.2 billion and 17.0 million shares for $1.3 billion in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\nContractual Obligations\n:\n \nOur largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2025 consisted of:\n•\nprincipal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that were included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments;\n•\nroutine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that were included in our consolidated balance sheet;\n•\nlease liabilities that were included in our consolidated balance sheet; \n•\nlease commitments that have not yet commenced and were not included in our consolidated balance sheet; and\n•\nother contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.\nIn addition, as of May 31, 2025, we had $12.0 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2026. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. Notes 6, 9, 12 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations and our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.\nStock-Based Awards\nOur stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2022 has been an annualized rate of 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nstock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options as of May 31, 2025, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has partially offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2025, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 5.6%.\nDuring fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of RSUs with a value of $5 million or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2025 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.\nStock-based awards activity from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2025 is summarized as follows (shares in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards outstanding as of May 31, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n225\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards granted and assumed\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n168\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards vested and issued and, if applicable, exercised\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(209\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeitures, cancellations and other, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(26\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards outstanding as of May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n158\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized stock repurchases\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(11\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares outstanding as of May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,807\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,743\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding as of May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n5.6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal in the money stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2025) as a percent of shares outstanding as of May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n5.6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n1.7%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n1.3%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.",
