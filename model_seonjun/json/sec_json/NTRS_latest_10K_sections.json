  "item1": "ITEM 1 – BUSINESS\nNorthern Trust Corporation\nNorthern Trust Corporation (the “Corporation”) is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. The Corporation is a financial holding company conducting business through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including The Northern Trust Company (Bank). \nThe Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in Chicago and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. Founded in 1889, the Bank conducts its business through its U.S. operations and its various U.S. and non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Bank had consolidated assets of $154.9 billion and common bank equity capital of $10.8 billion.\nThe Corporation was formed as a holding company for the Bank in 1971. The Corporation has a global presence with offices in 24 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and across 22 locations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. At December 31, 2024, the Corporation had consolidated total assets of $155.5 billion and stockholders’ equity of $12.8 billion.\nThe Corporation expects that the Bank will continue in the foreseeable future to be the major source of the Corporation’s consolidated assets, revenues, and net income. Except where the context otherwise requires, references to “Northern Trust,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its,” or similar terms mean Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nBusiness Overview\nNorthern Trust focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Northern Trust reports certain income and expense items not allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management in a third reporting segment, Other.\nASSET SERVICING\nAsset Servicing (AS) is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not limited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. At December 31, 2024, total Asset Servicing assets under custody/administration (AUC/A), assets under custody, and assets under management (AUM) were $15.6 trillion, $12.2 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively.\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT\nWealth Management (WM) focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking. Wealth Management also includes Global Family Office, which provides customized services, including but not limited to: investment management; global custody; fiduciary; private banking; family office consulting; and technology solutions to meet the complex financial and reporting needs of ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices across the globe.\nWealth Management is one of the largest providers of advisory services in the United States, with AUC/A, assets under custody, and AUM of $1.1 trillion, $1.1 trillion, and $450.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in 19 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n1\nASSET MANAGEMENT\nAsset Management, through the Corporation’s various subsidiaries, supports the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management reporting segments by providing a broad range of asset management and related services and other products to clients around the world. Investment solutions are delivered through separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, exchange traded funds, non-U.S. collective investment funds, and unregistered private investment funds. Asset Management’s capabilities include active and passive equity; active and passive fixed income; cash management; multi-asset and alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds); and multi-manager advisory services and products. Asset Management’s activities also include overlay services and other risk management services. Asset Management operates internationally through subsidiaries and distribution arrangements and its revenue and expense are fully allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. As discussed above, Northern Trust managed $1.6 trillion in assets as of December 31, 2024, including $1.2 trillion for Asset Servicing clients and $450.7 billion for Wealth Management clients.\nCompetition\nNorthern Trust faces intense competition in all aspects and areas of its business. Competition comes from both regulated and unregulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations. Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and service companies, including other custodial banks, investment counseling firms, deposit-taking institutions, asset management firms, benefits consultants, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, and various financial technology companies, including software providers and data services firms. As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world.\nNorthern Trust’s business strategy is to provide exceptional quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a competitive advantage to offer clients a unique value proposition. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors with premier, holistic solutions and exceptional experiences tailored to meet clients’ needs. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring and scalable sources of fee-based income and continual productivity improvements. Northern Trust also seeks to maintain its foundational strength with a strong, conservative balance sheet and a globally respected brand. \nEconomic Conditions And Government Policies\nThe earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value, and profitability of its loan and investment portfolios.\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) implements monetary policy through its open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal Reserve Banks, and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board directly affect interest rates and therefore what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds.\nSupervision and Regulation\nNorthern Trust is subject to extensive regulation and supervision under state and federal laws in the United States and in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business. The descriptions below outline significant elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized. These descriptions do not summarize all laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust or all possible or proposed changes to such laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statutes or regulatory provisions.\nChanges in laws or regulations applicable to Northern Trust may have a material effect on its businesses and results of operations. The scope of the laws and regulations, and the intensity of the supervision to which Northern Trust is subject have increased in recent years, initially in response to the financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors, including the banking turmoil in early 2023, technological factors, market changes, and climate change concerns. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Northern Trust expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and heightened supervision.\n2\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nFINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION\nUnder U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company subject to the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. A financial holding company is permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities than a bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board has authority to limit the activities that a financial holding company may conduct if any depository institution controlled by the financial holding company is found to no longer be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” or has not received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) examination. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements may result in restrictions on the Corporation’s ability to exercise powers granted to financial holding companies, to engage in new activities, to continue current activities, or to make acquisitions.  The Bank Holding Company Act also requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board before it acquires substantially all the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank.\nSUBSIDIARY REGULATION\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and is subject to regulation by both agencies. As an Illinois banking corporation, the Bank is also subject to Illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve Board and is registered as a swap dealer with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Exchange Act. As a result, the Bank is subject to supervision, examination and enforcement by certain other regulatory bodies, including the CFTC and the National Futures Association (NFA). The Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board and, in certain circumstances, other functional regulators, as discussed in greater detail below.\nENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS\nUnder the Federal Reserve Board’s tailoring rules, the Corporation is subject to the enhanced prudential standards applicable to Category II banking organizations. As a Category II institution, the Corporation must submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board, conduct supervisory and internal periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions, maintain enhanced risk management procedures, comply with a liquidity risk management framework (discussed below in “Liquidity Standards”) and single counterparty credit limits, conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event. The Corporation is not subject to all of the standards applicable to U.S. bank holding companies that are global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), such as the total loss-absorbing capacity requirement, capital surcharge, enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, or additional single counterparty credit limits.\nLONG-TERM DEBT AND CLEAN HOLDING COMPANY REQUIREMENTS \nIn 2023, the U.S. banking regulators proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets to comply with long-term debt requirements and clean holding company requirements similar to those that currently apply only to GSIBs. This proposal would also impose a long-term debt requirement on certain categories of insured depository institutions that are not consolidated subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets, such as the Bank. If adopted, this proposal would require the Corporation and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of risk-weighted assets (RWA), (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. The Bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt to the Corporation, and the Corporation would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt externally. In addition, if adopted as proposed, the clean holding company requirement would limit or prohibit the Corporation from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution, including, for example, prohibiting the Corporation from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties, as well as limiting the amount of the Corporation’s liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt. The timing and form of any final rule implementing the long-term debt and clean holding company requirements is uncertain.\nRESOLUTION PLANNING \nAs required by Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the Corporation is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC issued final joint guidance on resolution planning requirements applicable to the Corporation under Section 165(d). The Corporation’s next 2024 165(d) plan submission is due to the FDIC and Federal Reserve Board by October 1, 2025. \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n3\nIn addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is required to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of its failure. In June 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule that would require covered insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, to submit a full resolution plan to the FDIC every three years and submit an interim supplement in each year that it is not required to submit a full resolution plan. The final rule increases the content requirements for plan submissions and introduces a new credibility standard for the FDIC’s evaluation of resolution plans, which would be enforceable against the covered insured depository institutions. The final rule was effective October 1, 2024. The Bank’s first interim supplement is due July 1, 2025, and its full resolution plan is due July 1, 2026. \nSeparately, the European Union Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) sets out the framework for the recovery and resolution of European Union (EU) credit institutions and systemically-important investment firms, including certain of the Bank’s subsidiaries and branches. The BRRD establishes a set of harmonized rules for early intervention measures, recovery and resolution planning, bail-in powers and requirements for total loss absorbing capital for EU institutions, collectively known as minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). Northern Trust Global Services SE, a Luxembourg-incorporated indirect subsidiary of the Bank, is authorized and supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and subject to the prudential supervision of the ECB and the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). As such, Northern Trust Global Services SE falls within the scope of the BRRD and its recovery and resolution planning is overseen by the CSSF and the Single Resolution Board (the resolution authority for ECB-supervised institutions). \nThe United Kingdom (UK) has established a special resolution regime and a resolvability assessment framework overseen by the Bank of England (as the UK resolution authority) with many similar features to the BRRD, which was substantially retained as part of UK law following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. The special resolution regime applies to firms that are permitted to accept deposits under Part 4A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. As such, the London branch of the Bank, as a UK branch of a third-country institution that accepts deposits, falls within the scope of the special resolution regime. \nORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, such as the Corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to an orderly liquidation authority if in default or danger of default and their resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, among other requirements set by statute. If the Corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed as its receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve the Corporation. Absent such actions, the Corporation, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nTHE VOLCKER RULE.\nThe Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities, including the Bank and its affiliates, from engaging in proprietary trading, subject to certain exemptions and exclusions, such as for market-making, hedging, certain trading activities in U.S. and foreign sovereign debt, and trading activities related to liquidity management. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments in, and relationships with, covered funds as defined in the Volcker Rule, such as hedge funds, private equity funds and similar funds, subject to a number of exemptions and exclusions. Northern Trust maintains an enterprise-wide compliance program to comply with the Volcker Rule.\nHOLDING COMPANY AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH\nThe Corporation, as a bank holding company, is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its depository institution subsidiary. Under this requirement, the Corporation could be required to commit resources to the Bank should the Bank experience financial distress.\nPAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS\nThe Corporation may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the Federal Reserve Board, including the stress capital buffer requirement, discussed further in “—Capital Adequacy Requirements” below. Dividends from the Bank are a significant source of funds for the Corporation, and the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock therefore depends in part on the ability of the Bank to pay sufficient dividends to the Corporation. \nVarious other federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Corporation without regulatory consent. The Bank may not pay any dividends if it is undercapitalized, or if the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid in a calendar year is limited to its “recent earnings” (the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years), or its “undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus), whichever is less. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation may also be affected by the capital adequacy standards applicable to the Bank (discussed further below), which include minimum requirements and buffers.\n4\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nCAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING\nThe Corporation’s capital distributions are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital plan rules, which require the Corporation to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board for review. \nThe major components of that oversight are the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST). These requirements involve both company-run and supervisory-run testing of capital under various scenarios, including baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator.  \nUnder the DFAST regulations, the Corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve Board annually. The Bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test (although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the Corporation). Results from the Corporation’s and the Bank’s annual company-run stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available. Northern Trust published the results of its most recent company-run stress tests on June 28, 2024.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS\nThe Corporation, as a bank holding company, is subject to risk-based and leverage capital guidelines implemented by the Federal Reserve Board that are based on industry-standard guidelines published by the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), known as Basel III. The Bank, as an FDIC-insured depository institution, is also required to meet risk-based and leverage capital guidelines established by regulators which are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. \nUnder the Basel III rules, the Corporation, with the Bank, is a “core” banking organization that is required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly its risk-based capital ratios. The Corporation also is subject to a capital floor that is based on the Basel III standardized approach to calculating risk-based capital ratios. The Corporation is therefore required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches, and is subject to the more stringent of the two in the assessment of its capital adequacy.\nIn 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the Basel III endgame agreement for large banks (Basel III Endgame Proposal). The proposed rule has not been finalized and U.S. regulators have indicated their intent to revise and reissue the proposal. No time table has been provided for the re-proposal or its effective date.  The proposal would introduce a new method for calculating risk weighted assets, referred to as the expanded risk-based approach, which better aligns with the global Basel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee. The proposal would eliminate the current Basel III rule’s advanced approaches methodologies and effectively replace it with the expanded risk-based approach, which more heavily relies on standardized methodologies. As compared with the standardized approach, the expanded risk-based approach includes more granular risk weights for credit risk and introduces a new market risk framework. In addition, unlike the standardized approach, the expanded risk-based approach includes operational risk and credit valuation adjustment RWA components. \nThe Basel III Endgame Proposal, if adopted as a final rule, would maintain the current Basel III rule’s dual-requirement structure, whereby the Corporation and the Bank would be required to calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. In addition, the proposal would modify the standardized approach by requiring that the new market risk standards from the proposal also be applied in the standardized approach. \nThe Basel III Endgame Proposal would apply the stress capital buffer to risk-based capital requirements calculated under both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. \nIt is uncertain if and when the final rule for Basel III Endgame Proposal will be adopted, and if so, whether it will be finalized as proposed. The potential impacts on the Corporation and the Bank of a final rule remain uncertain until a final rule is published.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n5\nThe Bank’s risk-based and leverage capital ratios at December 31, 2024, were well above the regulatory requirements established by U.S. banking regulators. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank, together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “well-capitalized,” are provided in the following chart.\nTABLE 1: RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF\n \nDECEMBER 31, 2024 \nCOMMON EQUITY\nTIER 1 CAPITAL\nTIER 1 CAPITAL\nTOTAL CAPITAL\nTIER 1 LEVERAGE\nSUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE\nSTANDARDIZED\nAPPROACH\nADVANCED\nAPPROACH\nSTANDARDIZED\nAPPROACH\nADVANCED\nAPPROACH\nSTANDARDIZED\nAPPROACH\nADVANCED\nAPPROACH\nSTANDARDIZED\nAPPROACH\nADVANCED\nAPPROACH\nADVANCED\nAPPROACH\nNorthern Trust Corporation\n12.4 \n%\n14.5 \n%\n13.3 \n%\n15.6 \n%\n15.1 \n%\n17.4 \n%\n8.1 \n%\n8.1 \n%\n8.9 \n%\nThe Northern Trust Company\n11.4 \n%\n13.6 \n%\n11.4 \n%\n13.6 \n%\n12.8 \n%\n15.0 \n%\n6.9 \n%\n6.9 \n%\n7.5 \n%\nMinimum required ratio\n4.5 \n%\n4.5 \n%\n6.0 \n%\n6.0 \n%\n8.0 \n%\n8.0 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n3.0 \n%\n“Well-capitalized” minimum ratios, as applicable\nNorthern Trust Corporation\nN/A\nN/A\n6.0 \n%\n6.0 \n%\n10.0 \n%\n10.0 \n%\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nThe Northern Trust Company\n6.5 \n%\n6.5 \n%\n8.0 \n%\n8.0 \n%\n10.0 \n%\n10.0 \n%\n5.0 \n%\n5.0 \n%\n3.0 \n%\nAdvanced approaches institutions, such as the Corporation and the Bank, are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. Advanced approaches institutions that are insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, also must maintain at least a 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “well-capitalized.” The Corporation is also subject to a stress capital buffer, which integrates forward-looking stress test results with non-stress capital requirements, and the Bank is also subject to a capital conservation buffer, which respectively requires the Corporation and the Bank to hold a buffer of Common Equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation. The minimum capital buffer requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations, such as the Corporation and the Bank, is 2.5%.\nA “countercyclical buffer” of 0% to 2.5% of a banking organization’s total RWA for advanced approaches banking organizations, such as the Corporation, is also a component of the capital adequacy framework. In general, the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures. The U.S. countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0%.\nThe results of the 2024 DFAST, published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 26, 2024, resulted in Northern Trust’s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at 2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for the annual capital plan cycle, which began on October 1, 2024 and continues through September 30, 2025. \nLIQUIDITY STANDARDS\nNorthern Trust is subject to the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement, which is designed to ensure that covered banking organizations, including the Corporation and the Bank, maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to their expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under a prescribed regulatory liquidity stress scenario. As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation and the Bank were in compliance with applicable LCR requirements.\nNorthern Trust also is subject to the U.S. net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement, designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation and the Bank were in compliance with applicable NSFR requirements. In addition, Northern Trust publicly discloses certain qualitative and quantitative information about its NSFR consistent with the semi-annual disclosure requirements of the Federal Reserve Board’s final rule on U.S. NSFR disclosure.\nAs noted above, the enhanced prudential standards impose additional liquidity requirements for large bank holding companies. The Corporation, a Category II institution under the final tailoring rule, is subject to the liquidity risk management, monthly liquidity stress testing, liquidity buffer, and daily liquidity reporting requirements. \nPROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION\nFederal banking regulators are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, and are also authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company of an under-capitalized banking subsidiary. In certain instances, the Corporation could be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan for the Bank if it were under-capitalized. \n6\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nRESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES \nThe Bank is subject to restrictions governing transactions between it and affiliated entities, including the Corporation, its affiliates, and its subsidiaries. These transactions must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies (i.e., on terms not less favorable to the Bank than market terms). Further, extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for transactions with a single affiliate and to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for transactions with all affiliates. \nSWAPS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES. \nNorthern Trust is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose margin requirements, business conduct requirements, trade reporting, central clearing and mandatory trading on regulated exchanges or execution facilities for certain types of swaps and security-based swaps. CFTC and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules require registration of swap dealers and security-based swap dealers, respectively, and impose numerous obligations on such registrants, including adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope instruments. The Bank is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and is subject to CFTC and NFA rules and supervision related to its swaps business. Swap dealers regulated by a prudential regulator, like the Bank, are subject to uncleared swap margin requirements and minimum capital requirements established by the prudential regulators. The Corporation has not registered and does not expect that it, or any of its affiliates, will be required to register as a security-based swap dealer with the SEC.\nIn addition, certain nonbanking affiliates, including Northern Trust Securities, Inc. and Northern Trust Investments, Inc., are registered with the CFTC as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators, or are operating under certain exemptions from such registration pursuant to CFTC rules and other guidance, and commodity pool operators have certain responsibilities with respect to each pool they operate or advise.\nBROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER REGULATION\nNorthern Trust Securities, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of various self-regulatory organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations relating to all aspects of their securities business operations, including, but not limited to, sales and trading practices, securities offerings, handling of customer funds, net capital levels, recordkeeping, privacy requirements, and the conduct of directors, officers, and employees. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states where they do business. Northern Trust Securities, Inc. is also registered with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) as a municipal securities dealer and subject to regulation as such. \nNorthern Trust Securities, Inc. and other subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and are subject to regulation by the SEC. The Corporation’s registered investment advisers in the United States are subject to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Advisers Act), and SEC rules and regulations thereunder, including with respect to record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations, fiduciary and other obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, and other applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including anti-fraud laws. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Noncompliance with the Investment Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, termination of an investment adviser’s registration, fines and/or reputational harm.\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION, AND OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL\nCertain subsidiaries of the Corporation are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 and implemented in the regulation of the federal banking regulators and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which requires banks to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and financial transparency requirements, such as conducting due diligence, verifying client and beneficial owner identification, and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. AML laws outside the United States contain similar requirements.\n \nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 includes the Corporate Transparency Act, which requires FinCEN to issue regulations requiring reporting of and access to beneficial ownership information of legal entities and amendments to related customer due diligence requirements for financial institutions. The applicable rule is subject to litigation which is still pending although various preliminary injunctions have been stayed. In the meantime, FinCEN has extended the filing deadline by 30 days and signaled its intent to revisit the rule. Additionally, there is a possibility of legislation that will postpone the deadline to January 1, 2026.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and U.S. Department of State administer and enforce U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations, which prohibit the Corporation and its subsidiaries from engaging in certain transactions and dealings including business in or with certain jurisdictions and parties that are the target of U.S. economic sanctions, such as organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts or undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of democratic countries. If the Corporation or the Bank \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n7\nfinds a sanctioned name or jurisdiction on any transaction, asset or account, the Corporation or the Bank may be required to reject or block such account or transaction and notify the appropriate authorities.\n \n \nFailure to comply with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals, restrictions on their business activities or harm to reputation. Many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the Corporation’s non-U.S. offices. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations.\nDEPOSIT INSURANCE AND ASSESSMENTS\nThe Bank accepts deposits and eligible deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount, which is currently $250,000 for each ownership right and capacity under which the eligible deposit accounts are maintained. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated laws, regulations, or orders from a regulatory agency. \nThe FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is funded by assessments on FDIC-insured depository institutions. The FDIC assesses premiums based on an assessment rate and an assessment base. An insured depository institution’s assessment base considers average consolidated total assets, less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. The assessment base of custody banks is adjusted to exclude certain liquid assets from total average assets. To qualify as a custody bank, certain institutional eligibility criteria must be met. The Bank qualifies as a custody bank for this purpose. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based system to determine each institution’s assessment rate. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. \nThe FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. Based on the FDIC’s recent projections, the FDIC determined that the DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028 without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates. In 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule, applicable to insured depository institutions, to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning on January 1, 2023. The FDIC also concurrently maintained the long-term target reserve ratio for the DIF, referred to as the Designated Reserve Ratio, at 2.00% for 2024. The increase in assessment rate schedules is intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. \nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the DIF associated with bank failures in the first half of 2023.  The assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s estimated uninsured domestic office deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of uninsured domestic office deposits. The FDIC will collect the special assessment,\n \nover an initial eight-quarter collection period and currently projects that the special assessment will be collected for an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, at a lower rate, subject to change depending on any adjustments to the loss estimate, mergers, failures, or amendments to reported estimates of uninsured deposits. In conjunction with the special assessment, $84.6 million was recorded to Other Operating Expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. A subsequent reassessment by the FDIC in 2024 resulted in an increase of the assessed amount to $99.3 million and an additional $14.7 million was recorded to Other Operating Expense. The final rule was effective on April 1, 2024, with the first collection for the special assessment\n \nreflected on the invoice for the first quarterly assessment period of 2024, with a payment date of June 28, 2024. Three quarterly assessments aggregating $31.7 million were paid in 2024. For more information on the FDIC’s special assessment, please refer to Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.\nCOMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT\nThe Bank is subject to the CRA. The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. For purposes of the CRA, the Bank operates under a “wholesale” designation granted by the Federal Reserve Board and fulfills its CRA obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development. The Bank received an “outstanding” CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Board in its most recent CRA examination. \nIn 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule to amend their regulations implementing the CRA. The rule materially revises the current CRA framework, mostly for retail designated banks, including the assessment areas in which a bank is evaluated to include activities associated with online and mobile banking, the tests used to evaluate a bank in its assessment areas, new methods of calculating credit for lending, investment and service activities, and additional data collection and reporting requirements. The rule is expected to result in a significant increase in the thresholds for large banks to receive “outstanding” ratings in the future. \n8\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nAccording to the new rule, banks currently designated as “wholesale” will be absorbed into the “limited purpose” designation. The rule outlines that a limited purpose bank is one that is not in the business of extending consumer or retail loans, except on an incidental and accommodation basis. Limited purpose banks are only subject to a qualitative and quantitative review of a bank’s community development lending and investments in each assessment area. While we will continue to be evaluated on our community development activities in our local markets, we will also be evaluated against a national benchmark based on assets.\nThe rule was expected to take effect on April 1, 2024, with most of its provisions becoming applicable on January 1, 2026. Reporting of the collected data will not be required until 2027. Several banking industry groups filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the CRA final rule, in which they argued that the federal banking agencies exceeded their statutory authority in adopting the CRA final rule. In March 2024, a federal judge granted an injunction to extend the CRA final rule’s effective date, originally set for April 1, 2024. The effective date will be extended each day the injunction remains in place, pending the resolution of the lawsuit.  \nDATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY\nFederal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring financial institutions to adopt, disclose, and enforce privacy policies with respect to consumer information, setting limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information, setting standards for protecting client information and preventing unlawful access to such information, and requiring notice of data breaches in certain circumstances. For example, the Federal Trade Commission has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, including acts and practices with respect to data privacy and security, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act regulates the confidentiality and security of customer information obtained by financial institutions and certain other types of financial services businesses.\nMost U.S. states, the EU and other non-U.S. jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches―for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and its equivalent in the UK (UK GDPR), the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in China, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, CCPA) in the United States. Similar laws are in effect or being considered in other jurisdictions in which we operate across the globe. The GDPR is designed to harmonize data privacy and security laws across the European Economic Area (EEA) and to protect EEA citizens’ data privacy and security. The GDPR imposes stringent operational requirements on both data controllers and data processors and has extraterritorial effect as its scope includes all data controllers and processors outside the EEA whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, EEA individuals. Organizations that violate certain provisions of the GDPR could be fined up to €20 million or 4% of their annual worldwide revenue for the preceding fiscal year, whichever is greater. The GDPR also has been implemented into UK law as part of the arrangements following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and operates in conjunction with other local data privacy requirements, although the GDPR and UK GDPR may diverge over time. Prior to the most recent general election, the UK was in the process of reforming its data privacy rules through a new Data Protection and Digital Information Bill. \n \nThe Data Protection and Digital Information Bill did not become law before Parliament was dissolved on May 24, 2024. It is possible that it or similar data protection measures will be introduced by the government in the current Parliament. \nIn the United States, the CCPA broadly defines personal information and substantially increases the rights of California residents to understand how their personal information is collected, used, and otherwise processed by commercial businesses, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The CCPA includes a private right of action (permitting lawsuits to be brought by private individuals instead of the state Attorney General or other government actor for certain breaches), and contemplates civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation and up to $7,500 for each intentional violation. \nIn addition, several states have enacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive data privacy laws similar to the CCPA. These laws apply, or will apply, in addition to laws that already exist in all 50 U.S. states that require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has recently considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and security legislation, to which we may be subject if enacted. \nNorthern Trust uses a variety of machine learning and artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions to process transactional activity more efficiently and to mitigate risk. These uses currently include, among others, digitizing documents, detecting anomalous, fraudulent transactions and training services teams on operational processes.  \nRegulation of AI is rapidly evolving in the U.S. and worldwide as legislators and regulators are increasingly focused on these powerful emerging technologies. The technologies underlying AI and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n9\nNorthern Trust has certain processes and controls in place designed to mitigate the risks associated with the use of AI solutions, including monitoring the development and applicability of such evolving laws and regulations, and will take steps designed to comply with laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust’s use of AI.\nThe Corporation maintains a regulatory change framework designed to monitor and respond to regulatory change, including with respect to data privacy and security, and has adopted and disseminated privacy policies and communicates required information relating to financial privacy and data security in accordance with applicable law. \nCONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS\nThe Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution. Consumer laws and regulations are enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and other federal and state regulators.\nNON-U.S. REGULATION\nNorthern Trust is subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which its non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries operate. For example, branches and subsidiaries conducting banking and asset servicing businesses in the UK are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. They are authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and/or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The PRA and FCA exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations, impose capital requirements, suspend registered employees, and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees. Additionally, the Bank is licensed as a foreign authorized deposit-taking institution in Australia under the Banking Act (Australia) and as a wholesale bank in Singapore under the Banking Act (Singapore) and as a result is subject to the supervision of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, respectively. \nNorthern Trust’s European branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the EU and the member states in which they are domiciled. For example, Northern Trust Global Services SE, as an EU-domiciled credit institution in Luxembourg, is subject to the prudential supervision of the ECB and the CSSF. Moreover, Northern Trust’s non-EU branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities in the EU may fall within the scope of the laws of the EU and, given the increasing extraterritorial effect of EU legislation, non-EU branches and subsidiaries may still fall within the scope of EU law if they transact outside of the EU with EU clients.\nSince January 31, 2020, the UK has not been a member of the EU. EU legislation as it applied to the UK on December 31, 2020 is a part of UK domestic legislation, under the control of the UK’s parliament. Most UK law relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries is still closely aligned with the EU legislative framework in place in December 2020. However, in 2022, the UK government proposed legislation that makes significant reforms to the UK’s financial services regulations. In particular, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 includes measures revoking retained EU law relating to financial services. In addition, the UK government announced a package of post-Brexit reforms to drive growth and competitiveness in the financial services sector. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 along with these other reforms may directly and indirectly impact the Corporation.\nThe following items provide a brief description of certain key regulatory requirements in the EU and the UK relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, in addition to the BRRD and GDPR and UK GDPR discussed under “Resolution Planning” and “Data Privacy and Security,” respectively, above.\nEU and UK Prudential Regulatory Frameworks.\n The EU Capital Requirements Directive of June 26, 2013 (CRD) and the EU Capital Requirements Regulation of June 26, 2013 (CRR) set out the framework for prudential regulation of credit institutions in the EU, including, among other things, capital and liquidity requirements, leverage, and disclosure and reporting. CRR and CRD have been subject to extensive amendments relating to the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, large exposures, and market and counterparty credit risk, enhancing the resiliency of EU banks to potential future economic shocks, the transition to climate neutrality and finalizing the implementation of the Basel III agreement. Since June 26, 2021, investment firms under the recast Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID) have been subject to a new prudential regime under the EU Investment Firm Directive and Investment Firm Regulation. In April 2021, the Financial Services Act came into force in the UK establishing among other things, (i) a framework for the new investment firm prudential framework to apply in the UK and (ii) the UK implementation of Basel III standards, including amendments to CRR as implemented into UK law following the withdrawal from the EU. UK and EU branches and subsidiaries of the Corporation may also be subject to local rules on outsourcing and operational resilience. In June 2024, the texts of CRR III and CRD VI, were formally published in the Official Journal of the EU. Through these regulations, the EU will implement the Basel III accord into EU law. These regulations affect the capital and liquidity requirements of European banking entities and restrict the provision of prescribed core banking services, including lending, the provision of guarantees and commitments, and the taking of deposits or other borrowing, by non-EU entities to EU entities, except where these services are provided through an authorized EU branch or where an exemption applies. The new regime will be phased in, beginning in 2024 through to 2027.   \n10\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMarkets Regulation. \nMIFID (which came into force in 2018), the linked Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MIFIR), and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation 648/2012 (EMIR) are the primary pieces of EU legislation which regulate, among other things, trading in derivative and securities markets, transaction reporting, investor protection, clearing and risk mitigation. MIFID, MIFIR and EMIR, with applicable amendments, now form part of UK law under the legislation implemented when the UK left the EU. Reforms to the onshored version of MIFIR have been made by the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2023. The reforms impact, among other things, the share trading obligation and derivatives trading obligation.\nCentral Securities Depositories Regulation.\n On September 17, 2014, the EU Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) entered into force (subject to a number of transitional provisions). The CSDR aims principally to ensure that transactions between buyers and sellers of dematerialized securities are settled in a safe and timely manner by introducing common securities settlement standards across the EU. Key features of the CSDR include shorter settlement periods, settlement discipline measures (including mandatory cash penalties and “buy-ins” for settlement fails and settlement fails reporting) and an obligation regarding dematerialization for most securities. In the UK, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 grants to the Bank of England new rule-making powers in relation to central securities depositories (CSD).\nSecurities Financing Transactions and Reuse of Collateral Regulation. \nOn November 25, 2015, the EU adopted a regulation on securities financing transactions and reuse of collateral (SFTR) as part of its approach to addressing shadow banking. The regulation includes provisions for enhanced transparency and reporting of securities financing transactions. The SFTR entered into force on January 12, 2016. The reporting obligations under the SFTR were phased in over several periods through January 11, 2021.\nBenchmarks Regulation. \nOn January 1, 2018, the EU Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) became applicable in all EU member states. The principal objectives of the BMR are to restore investor confidence in the accuracy, robustness and integrity of indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, and the benchmark-setting process itself. The BMR aims to achieve these objectives by ensuring that benchmarks are not subject to conflicts of interest, are used appropriately, and reflect the actual market or economic reality they are intended to measure. The BMR has been incorporated into UK law following the withdrawal from the EU, with applicable amendments. \nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulations. \nOn December 29, 2019, the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulations (SFDR) entered into force. SFDR aims to prevent “greenwashing” (conveying a misleading or false impression a product is more environmentally favorable than it actually is) by requiring disclosure of how sustainability risks and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are part of the investment and business processes of asset managers. Mandatory disclosures are required to be published at product and manager levels in a variety of ways, including on websites, in pre-contractual documents (e.g., prospectuses) and in annual reports. In October 2021, the UK government announced that it will launch its own consultation with stakeholders on sustainable finance disclosures rules for certain UK market participants and certain investment products. On October 25, 2022, the FCA issued a consultation paper on new measures for a UK regime on sustainability disclosure requirements and investment labels. The new measures, including an anti-greenwashing rule, product labels and product naming and marketing rules, entered into force during the course of 2024.\nTaxonomy Regulation.\n On July 12, 2020, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulations) entered into force. The Taxonomy Regulations are part of the EU’s recent measures designed to encourage environmentally sustainable investment decision making and introduce a technical framework to ascertain how sustainable an economic activity is. The Taxonomy Regulations apply to financial market participants including MiFID firms, Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) management companies, and alternative investment fund managers, and will require them to make further entity, pre-contractual and periodic disclosures. The UK government is in the process of consulting on and implementing its own “green” taxonomy for guiding companies and investors on “green” investments, similar to the EU regime.\nDeposit Guarantee Scheme. \nEligible deposits held with EU credit institutions and certain other financial entities are subject to the recast Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) implemented in 2014. It required EU member states to introduce legislation establishing at least one deposit guarantee scheme (DGS). A DGS which is established and recognized in one member state is obliged to cover the depositors (up to certain prescribed amounts) at branches of the same institution in other EU member states. In the UK, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme is the national DGS for the protection and reimbursement of depositors of failed financial institutions.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n11\nFifth EU Money Laundering Directive. \nOn July 9, 2018, the Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive (MLD5) entered into force. MLD5 was required to be transposed into local law by EU member states by January 10, 2020 and introduced the following key changes to the previous EU AML regime: (i) EU member states must ensure that registers of ultimate beneficial owners of companies and other legal entities are accessible to the general public; (ii) the previous AML regime was extended to additional service providers, such as electronic wallet providers, virtual currency exchange service providers, and art dealers, and further specifications regarding the scope of application of MLD5 with respect to tax advisors and estate agents were provided; (iii) the threshold for identifying holders of prepaid cards was lowered to €150; and (iv) EU member states were required to implement enhanced due diligence measures to monitor suspicious transactions involving high-risk countries more strictly. The UK government transposed MLD5 into UK law and, therefore, the UK anti-money laundering regime is currently broadly aligned with the EU. On December 7, 2022, the Council of the EU agreed its position on AML regulation through the Sixth EU Money Laundering Directive. The new rules will extend to, among other items, the entire crypto-asset sector, third-party intermediaries, persons trading in precious metals, precious stones and cultural goods. The text of the Sixth EU Money Laundering Directive was published in June 2024 and EU member states have until 2027 to transpose its requirements into national legislation.\nShareholder Rights Directive. \nOn May 17, 2017, the recast Shareholder Rights Directive (EU) 2017/828 was published (SRD II). Member states of the EU were required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive by June 10, 2019. SRD was designed to establish requirements in relation to the exercise of shareholder rights and, recognizing that shares are often held through complex chains of intermediaries, SRD II is designed to improve mechanisms for the identification of shareholders by companies, as well as improve the transmission of information along the chain of intermediaries to facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights. Non-EU intermediaries are required to comply with the requirements if they provide services with respect to shares of companies that have their registered office in the EU. SRD II has been incorporated into UK law and remains largely aligned with the EU.\nDepositary Books & Records. \nFollowing the European Securities and Markets Authority’s opinion on asset segregation and application of depositary delegation rules to CSDs published on July 20, 2017, changes were introduced by two EU regulations modifying the existing Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and UCITS Level 2 Regulations. The changes aim to better define asset segregation requirements and to add additional safeguards, primarily focusing on information flow between the depositary and any third party to whom safe-keeping functions have been delegated. The key changes (i) impact the frequency of reconciliations between the depositary’s internal accounts and records and those of any third party in the custody chain, (ii) require the depositary to maintain an independent record separate from the record maintained by the third party, and (iii) increase due diligence obligations where custody of assets is delegated to third parties outside of the EU. AIFMD and the UCITS directive were incorporated into UK law and remain largely aligned with the EU. The changes impact Northern Trust’s subsidiaries providing depositary services to European-domiciled fund clients.\nIn addition to the above, the Bank’s and the Corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the United States are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2024, each of our non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements.\nHuman Capital Management\nOur talent is our greatest asset and a core enabler of our strategy. Empowering our employees is central to our talent vision. Northern Trust employed approximately 23,300 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2024. The regional breakout of our employee base is 42% Asia-Pacific, 41% North America, and 17% Europe, Middle East, and Africa.\nTHE EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE\nWe elevate the employee experience from recruitment to retirement by investing in three core areas: professional development, rewarding performance, and strengthening workforce and operational resiliency. By fostering an environment where our employees thrive, we ensure that our workforce is fully engaged, motivated, celebrated, and equipped to drive our strategy.\nTo support this effort, we continue to invest in our Human Capital Management System to streamline manual processes and enable dynamic workforce analytics, helping managers make informed decisions and gain insights into their teams.\nOur culture influences how we behave as an organization and unites us across businesses, geographies, and functions.  Embedded in our culture are five behaviors to help us deliver on our strategic objectives: relentlessly client-centric, constantly managing risk, respectfully candid, intentionally inclusive, and always accountable.\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\nFrom internships to executive development, our goal is to help our employees excel in their current roles and acquire new skills for future growth. Through Northern Trust University, we deliver comprehensive professional and functional training programs designed to equip our employees at every stage of their careers. Our performance management practices promote \n12\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nhigh performance across the company and are aligned to our strategy from goal-setting to evaluation. We provide comprehensive manager training on performance differentiation and application to our performance ratings scale to foster transparent feedback and continuous improvement. \nREWARDING PERFORMANCE\nWe believe that recognizing and rewarding the contributions of our employees is critical to their continued success. We have a variety of awards and recognition programs tailored to different opportunities and achievements. Our in-person celebrations, such as our Quarter Century Club, which honors our long-tenured employees, and the Chairman’s Awards, which recognize outstanding individual and team achievements, reinforce performance and appreciation.\nWe ensure our employees are compensated fairly by aligning their total compensation with market competitive pay for their roles, experience, and performance. Our total compensation includes base salaries, performance-linked incentive compensation, and comprehensive benefits designed to meet the needs of our employees and their families.\nWORKFORCE & OPERATIONAL RESILIENCY\nOur operating model is designed to reinforce the strength of our control framework, foster enterprise change management, provide robust governance and oversight, accelerate scalable growth, and leverage and develop our talent. To align with our strategy and position the Corporation for future success, new leaders are appointed from our internal talent pool as well as recruited externally to bring in new skills and expertise. \nPlanning for leadership resiliency is a core component of our talent strategy. We identify and develop leaders with the necessary skills to execute business strategies and have documented succession plans for leadership resiliency roles. \nOur well-being programs support employees and help maintain an inclusive and resilient environment. Through these programs, we enhance employee engagement, reduce workforce risks, and build an adaptive, high-performing culture.\nIn 2024, over 88% of our employees participated in the annual Employee Engagement Survey which is a crucial tool for understanding and meeting the needs of our employees and driving engagement and retention. The survey results are reviewed by the Board and discussed in leadership meetings, reflecting our dedication to continuous improvement.\nEmbedded in our engagement survey is an inclusion index which is a gauge to understand our employees’ sense of belonging and their ability to contribute to the success of the firm. We are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace that aligns with the Corporation’s mission, values, goals, business practices, and all applicable laws.\nAvailable Information\nThrough the Corporation’s website at www.northerntrust.com, the Corporation makes available free of charge its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all other reports and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as soon as reasonably practicable after it files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the SEC.

The Corporation was formed as a holding company for the Bank in 1971. The Corporation has a global presence with offices in 24 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and across 22 locations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region.

For a discussion related to the consolidated results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K), which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.\nRevenue\nNorthern Trust generates the majority of its revenue from Noninterest Income that primarily consists of Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees. Net Interest Income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of Interest Income generated by earning assets, net of Interest Expense on deposits and borrowed funds.\nRevenue in 2024 of $8.3 billion increased $1.5 billion, or 22%, from $6.8 billion in 2023, primarily driven by higher Other Operating Income, Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, and Net Interest Income. Noninterest Income represented 74% and 71% of total revenue in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and totaled $6.1 billion in 2024, which increased $1.3 billion, or 28%, from $4.8 billion in 2023.  \nNoninterest Income in 2024 increased primarily due to higher Other Operating Income as well as Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees. Other Operating Income of $1.2 billion in 2024 increased $928.7 million from $228.7 million in the prior year, primarily driven by a $896.7 million gain related to Northern Trust’s participation in an exchange offer related to shares of a class of Visa, Inc. common stock and a $68.1 million gain on the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by mark-to-market activity on existing swap agreements related to shares of a class of Visa, Inc. common stock, including a $12.8 million expense related to litigation escrow funding, as well as losses recognized as a result of a securities repositioning related to the supplemental pension plan and impairment charges taken on certain investments. Please refer to Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional details related to the exchange offer. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees of $4.7 billion in 2024 increased $366.0 million, or 8%, from $4.4 billion in 2023, primarily due to favorable markets and net new business. Investment Security Gains (Losses), net reflects $189.3 million of losses in 2024 as compared to $169.5 million of losses in 2023, both due to repositionings of the available for sale debt securities portfolio in each year. \nNet Interest Income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis in 2024 of $2.2 billion increased $169.4 million, or 8%, from $2.0 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher deposits and higher average interest rates, partially offset by an unfavorable balance sheet mix. The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to 1.64% in 2024 from 1.56% in 2023, primarily due to higher average interest rates and a favorable funding mix shift. Average earning assets increased $3.6 billion, or 3%, from $130.8 billion in 2023 to $134.4 billion in 2024, primarily due to higher client deposits, partially offset by lower borrowing activity, the net of which resulted in higher funding of earning assets. \nAdditional information regarding Northern Trust’s revenue by type is provided in the following table.\nTABLE 4: REVENUE\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNoninterest Income\n       Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees\n$\n4,727.8\n \n$\n4,361.8 \n$\n4,432.6 \n       Foreign Exchange Trading Income\n231.2\n \n203.9 \n288.6 \n       Treasury Management Fees\n35.7\n \n31.6 \n39.3 \n       Security Commissions and Trading Income\n150.5\n \n135.0 \n136.2 \n       Other Operating Income\n1,157.4\n \n228.7 \n191.3 \n       Investment Security Gains (Losses), net\n(189.3)\n(169.5)\n(214.0)\nTotal Noninterest Income\n$\n6,113.3\n \n$\n4,791.5 \n$\n4,874.0 \nNet Interest Income\n(1)\n2,177.1\n \n1,982.0 \n1,887.2 \nTotal Revenue\n$\n8,290.4\n \n$\n6,773.5 \n$\n6,761.2 \n(1)\n Net Interest Income stated on a GAAP basis.

Custody and Fund Administration fees, are driven primarily by values of client AUC/A, transaction volumes and the number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment Management fees are based generally on market values of client AUM management throughout the period. Typically, the asset values used to calculate fee revenue are based on a one-month or one-quarter lag.\nSecurities Lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. The Other fee category in Asset Servicing includes products such as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee.\nCustody and Fund Administration fees increased in 2024 from 2023 primarily due to favorable markets and net new business. Investment Management fees increased in 2024 from 2023 primarily due to  favorable markets and net new business. Securities Lending decreased in 2024 from 2023 primarily due to lower spreads. Other fees increased from the prior-year, primarily due to new business.\nThe following tables provide a breakdown of the Asset Servicing assets under custody and assets under management.\nTABLE 6: ASSET SERVICING ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY\nDECEMBER 31,\nCHANGE\n($ In Billions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 / 2023\n2023 / 2022\nNorth America\n$\n7,286.9\n \n$\n6,373.4 \n$\n5,703.1 \n14\n \n%\n12 \n%\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa\n3,855.0\n \n3,493.9 \n3,037.6 \n10\n \n15 \nAsia Pacific\n895.9\n \n847.3 \n823.3 \n6\n \n3 \nSecurities Lending\n176.2\n \n167.4 \n148.3 \n5\n \n13 \nTotal Assets Under Custody\n$\n12,214.0\n \n$\n10,882.0 \n$\n9,712.3 \n12\n \n%\n12 \n%\n40\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 7: ASSET SERVICING ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT\nDECEMBER 31,\nCHANGE\n($ In Billions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 / 2023\n2023 / 2022\nNorth America\n$\n788.8\n \n$\n681.3 \n$\n586.0 \n16\n \n%\n16 \n%\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa\n154.1\n \n141.8 \n121.3 \n9\n \n17 \nAsia Pacific\n40.6\n \n41.5 \n42.5 \n(2)\n(2)\nSecurities Lending\n176.2\n \n167.4 \n148.3 \n5\n \n13 \nTotal Assets Under Management\n$\n1,159.7\n \n$\n1,032.0 \n$\n898.1 \n12\n \n%\n15 \n%\nCash and other assets deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities borrowed from custody clients are managed by Northern Trust and are included in assets under custody and assets under management.

Active management of currency positions, within conservative limits, also contributes to foreign exchange trading income. Foreign Exchange Trading Income in 2024 increased from 2023, primarily driven by higher trading volumes.\nSecurity Commissions and Trading Income\nSecurity Commissions and Trading Income, generated primarily from securities brokerage services provided by Northern Trust Securities, Inc., in 2024 increased from 2023, primarily driven by an increase in equity commissions from higher equity trading volumes.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n43\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOther Operating Income\nOther Operating Income in 2024 increased from 2023 primarily driven by a $896.7 million gain related to Northern Trust’s participation in an exchange offer related to shares of a class of Visa, Inc. common stock and a $68.1 million gain on the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by mark-to-market activity on existing swap agreements related to shares of a class of Visa, Inc. common stock, including a $12.8 million expense related to litigation escrow funding, as well as losses recognized as a result of a securities repositioning related to the supplemental pension plan and impairment charges taken on certain investments. Please refer to Note 18, “Other Operating Income” and Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional details related to Other Operating Income and Visa, respectively.\nInvestment Security Gains (Losses), Net\nInvestment Security Gains (Losses), net reflects a $189.3 million loss on the sale of available for sale debt securities in the current period arising from a repositioning of the portfolio. In the prior year, there was $169.5 million of losses on sales of available for sale debt securities also arising from repositionings of the portfolio.\nNet Interest Income\nNet Interest Income is defined as the total of Interest Income and amortized fees on earning assets, less Interest Expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. Earning assets—including Federal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks, Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits, Securities, Loans and Leases, and Other Interest-Earning Assets—are financed by a large base of interest-bearing liabilities that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt. Short-term borrowings include Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. Earning assets also are funded by noninterest-bearing funds, which include demand deposits and Stockholders’ Equity. Net Interest Income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact Net Interest Income.\nNet interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets.\nNet Interest Income stated on an FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income on an FTE basis is provided in “Supplemental Information—Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent” within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section. \n44\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables present an analysis of average daily balances and interest rates affecting Net Interest Income and an analysis of Net Interest Income changes.\nTABLE 19: AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME (INTEREST AND RATE ON A FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS)\n(1)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n($ In Millions)\nINTEREST\nAVERAGE\nBALANCE\nAVERAGE RATE\n(8)\nINTEREST\nAVERAGE\nBALANCE\nAVERAGE RATE\n(8)\nINTEREST\nAVERAGE\nBALANCE\nAVERAGE RATE\n(8)\nINTEREST-EARNING ASSETS\nFederal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits\n$\n1,735.9\n \n$\n35,179.9\n \n4.93\n \n%\n$\n1,462.3 \n$\n31,205.4 \n4.69 \n%\n$\n472.0 \n$\n36,248.8 \n1.30 \n%\nInterest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks\n(2)\n122.6\n \n4,800.8\n \n2.55\n \n130.1 \n4,333.9 \n3.00 \n46.6 \n4,192.5 \n1.11 \nFederal Funds Sold\n—\n \n0.4\n \n5.40\n \n0.3 \n6.1 \n4.92 \n0.1 \n5.5 \n3.22 \nSecurities Purchased under Agreements to Resell\n(3)\n3,340.2\n \n727.5\n \n459.13\n \n1,585.2 \n950.9 \n166.71 \n103.7 \n1,071.2 \n9.68 \nDebt Securities\nAvailable For Sale\n1,443.2\n \n26,871.9\n \n5.37\n \n1,059.7 \n24,356.6 \n4.35 \n612.8 \n32,060.2 \n1.91 \nHeld To Maturity\n450.8\n \n23,230.7\n \n1.94\n \n478.0 \n25,511.9 \n1.87 \n289.5 \n22,970.0 \n1.26 \nTrading Account\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n0.1 \n0.5 \n13.50 \n0.4 \n12.1 \n3.84 \nTotal Debt Securities\n1,894.0\n \n50,102.6\n \n3.78\n \n1,537.8 \n49,869.0 \n3.08 \n902.7 \n55,042.3 \n1.64 \nLoans and Leases\n(4)\n2,571.0\n \n40,916.7\n \n6.28\n \n2,556.8 \n42,177.0 \n6.06 \n1,348.0 \n41,030.6 \n3.28 \nOther Interest-Earning Assets\n(5)\n130.4\n \n2,688.4\n \n4.85\n \n110.0 \n2,259.0 \n4.87 \n50.2 \n1,248.1 \n4.03 \nTotal Interest-Earning Assets\n9,794.1\n \n134,416.3\n \n7.29\n \n7,382.5 \n130,801.3 \n5.64 \n2,923.3 \n138,839.0 \n2.11 \nCash and Due from Banks and Other Central Bank Deposits\n(6)\n—\n \n1,698.8\n \n—\n \n— \n1,771.6 \n— \n— \n2,069.5 \n— \nOther Noninterest-Earning Assets\n—\n \n10,518.4\n \n—\n \n— \n10,076.3 \n— \n— \n11,643.4 \n— \nTotal Assets\n$\n—\n \n$\n146,633.5\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n— \n$\n142,649.2 \n— \n%\n$\n— \n$\n152,551.9 \n— \n%\nAVERAGE SOURCE OF FUNDS\nDeposits\nSavings, Money Market, and Other\n$\n960.7\n \n$\n26,236.3\n \n3.66\n \n%\n$\n689.2 \n$\n24,172.4 \n2.85 \n%\n$\n222.3 \n$\n30,205.0 \n0.74 \n%\nSavings Certificates and Other Time\n299.3\n \n5,856.9\n \n5.11\n \n151.9 \n3,341.2 \n4.54 \n17.8 \n1,059.7 \n1.68 \nNon-U.S. Offices – Interest-Bearing\n2,155.9\n \n63,854.7\n \n3.38\n \n1,844.2 \n60,008.6 \n3.07 \n362.7 \n65,031.3 \n0.56 \nTotal Interest-Bearing Deposits\n3,415.9\n \n95,947.9\n \n3.56\n \n2,685.3 \n87,522.2 \n3.07 \n602.8 \n96,296.0 \n0.63 \nFederal Funds Purchased\n129.2\n \n2,616.4\n \n4.94\n \n256.9 \n5,144.3 \n4.99 \n34.1 \n1,407.8 \n2.43 \nSecurities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase\n(3)\n3,280.4\n \n518.5\n \n632.65\n \n1,541.1 \n401.5 \n383.84 \n90.7 \n433.6 \n20.94 \nOther Borrowings\n(7)\n362.7\n \n6,980.3\n \n5.20\n \n542.5 \n10,339.5 \n5.25 \n126.2 \n5,463.5 \n2.31 \nSenior Notes\n173.5\n \n2,764.0\n \n6.28\n \n170.0 \n2,734.0 \n6.22 \n92.7 \n2,756.0 \n3.36 \nLong-Term Debt\n223.5\n \n4,073.2\n \n5.49\n \n147.2 \n2,586.0 \n5.69 \n44.0 \n1,258.9 \n3.49 \nTotal Interest-Bearing Liabilities\n7,585.2\n \n112,900.3\n \n6.72\n \n5,343.0 \n108,727.5 \n4.91 \n990.5 \n107,615.8 \n0.92 \nInterest Rate Spread\n—\n \n—\n \n0.57\n \n— \n— \n0.73 \n— \n— \n1.19 \nDemand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits\n—\n \n16,752.4\n \n—\n \n— \n17,723.3 \n— \n— \n29,296.4 \n— \nOther Noninterest-Bearing Liabilities\n—\n \n4,681.0\n \n—\n \n— \n4,701.6 \n— \n— \n4,558.3 \n— \nStockholders’ Equity\n—\n \n12,299.8\n \n—\n \n— \n11,496.8 \n— \n— \n11,081.4 \n— \nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\n$\n—\n \n$\n146,633.5\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n— \n$\n142,649.2 \n— \n%\n$\n— \n$\n152,551.9 \n— \n%\nLess: FTE Adjustment\n$\n31.8\n \n$\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n57.5 \n$\n— \n— \n%\n$\n45.6 \n$\n— \n— \n%\nNet Interest Income/Margin (Unadjusted)\n$\n2,177.1\n \n$\n—\n \n1.62\n \n%\n$\n1,982.0 \n$\n— \n1.52 \n%\n$\n1,887.2 \n$\n— \n1.36 \n%\nNet Interest Income/Margin (FTE Adjusted)\n(9)\n$\n2,208.9\n \n$\n—\n \n1.64\n \n%\n$\n2,039.5 \n$\n— \n1.56 \n%\n$\n1,932.8 \n$\n— \n1.39 \n%\n(1) \nNorthern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source income and assets. Non-U.S. source income and assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. On the basis of averages, the percentage of total assets attributable to foreign activities was 16%, 18%, and 19% as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On the basis of averages, the percentage of total liabilities attributable to foreign activities was 54%, 55%, and 58% as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For additional information, refer to the Geographic Area Information section of Note 31, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n(2) \nInterest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks includes the interest-bearing component of Cash and Due from Banks and Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks as presented on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3) \nIncludes the impact of balance sheet netting under master netting arrangements of approximately $62.4 billion and $29.1 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rate on Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell would be approximately 5.29% and 5.27% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rate on Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase would be approximately 5.21% and 5.22% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Northern Trust nets securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements when there is a legally enforceable master netting arrangement.\n(4) \nAverage balances include nonaccrual loans. \n(5)\n Other Interest-Earning Assets include certain community development investments, collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve stock, and money market investments which are classified in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(6) \nCash and Due from Banks and Other Central Bank Deposits includes the noninterest-bearing component of Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(7) \nOther Borrowings primarily includes advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.\n(8) \nRate calculations are based on actual balances rather than the rounded amounts presented in the table above.\n(9)\nA reconciliation of Net Interest Income on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income on an FTE basis is provided in “Supplemental Information—Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent” within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section. \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n45\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 20: ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME CHANGES DUE TO VOLUME AND RATE\n(1)\n(INTEREST AND RATE ON A FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS)\n2024 VS. 2023 CHANGE DUE TO \n2023 VS. 2022 CHANGE DUE TO \n(In Millions)\nAVERAGE\nBALANCE\nAVERAGE RATE\nNET (DECREASE) INCREASE\nAVERAGE\nBALANCE\n AVERAGE RATE\nNET (DECREASE) INCREASE\nIncrease (Decrease) in Net Interest Income (FTE)\nFederal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits\n$\n195.2\n \n$\n78.4\n \n$\n273.6\n \n$\n(74.4)\n$\n1,064.7 \n$\n990.3 \nInterest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks\n13.2\n \n(20.7)\n(7.5)\n1.7 \n81.8 \n83.5 \nFederal Funds Sold\n(0.3)\n—\n \n(0.3)\n— \n0.2 \n0.2 \nSecurities Purchased under Agreements to Resell\n(2)\n(7.2)\n1,762.2\n \n1,755.0\n \n(12.9)\n1,494.4 \n1,481.5 \nDebt Securities\nAvailable For Sale\n117.2\n \n266.3\n \n383.5\n \n(176.9)\n623.8 \n446.9 \nHeld To Maturity\n(43.7)\n16.5\n \n(27.2)\n34.9 \n153.6 \n188.5 \nTrading Account\n(0.2)\n0.1\n \n(0.1)\n(0.7)\n0.4 \n(0.3)\nTotal Debt Securities\n73.3\n \n282.9\n \n356.2\n \n(142.7)\n777.8 \n635.1 \nLoans and Leases\n(77.4)\n91.6\n \n14.2\n \n38.6 \n1,170.2 \n1,208.8 \nOther Interest-Earning Assets\n20.8\n \n(0.4)\n20.4\n \n47.5 \n12.3 \n59.8 \nTotal Interest Income\n$\n217.6\n \n$\n2,194.0\n \n$\n2,411.6\n \n$\n(142.2)\n$\n4,601.4 \n$\n4,459.2 \nInterest-Bearing Deposits\nSavings, Money Market and Other\n$\n62.7\n \n$\n208.8\n \n$\n271.5\n \n$\n(52.8)\n$\n519.7 \n$\n466.9 \nSavings Certificates and Other Time\n126.4\n \n21.0\n \n147.4\n \n74.9 \n59.2 \n134.1 \nNon-U.S. Offices - Interest-Bearing\n121.1\n \n190.6\n \n311.7\n \n(30.2)\n1,511.7 \n1,481.5 \nTotal Interest-Bearing Deposits\n310.2\n \n420.4\n \n730.6\n \n(8.1)\n2,090.6 \n2,082.5 \nFederal Funds Purchased\n(124.9)\n(2.8)\n(127.7)\n159.3 \n63.5 \n222.8 \nSecurities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase\n(2)\n122.1\n \n1,617.2\n \n1,739.3\n \n(7.2)\n1,457.6 \n1,450.4 \nOther Borrowings\n(174.6)\n(5.2)\n(179.8)\n171.8 \n244.5 \n416.3 \nSenior Notes\n1.9\n \n1.6\n \n3.5\n \n(0.7)\n78.0 \n77.3 \nLong-Term Debt\n81.7\n \n(5.4)\n76.3\n \n64.6 \n38.6 \n103.2 \nTotal Interest Expense\n$\n216.4\n \n$\n2,025.8\n \n$\n2,242.2\n \n$\n379.7 \n$\n3,972.8 \n$\n4,352.5 \n(Decrease) Increase in Net Interest Income (FTE)\n$\n1.2\n \n$\n168.2\n \n$\n169.4\n \n$\n(521.9)\n$\n628.6 \n$\n106.7 \n(1)\n Changes not due solely to average balance changes or rate changes are allocated proportionately to average balance\n \nand\n \nrate based on their relative absolute magnitudes.\n(2) \nChanges due to average balance and average rate include the impact of balance sheet netting as noted in Table 20: Average Consolidated Balance Sheets with Analysis of Net Interest Income. Excluding the impact of netting, the 2024 vs. 2023 change in Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell attributed to the average balance and the average rate would be $1.8 billion and $4.1 million respectively. The 2023 vs. 2022 change attributed to the average balance and the average rate would be $1.2 billion and $294.9 million respectively. Excluding the impact of netting, the 2024 vs. 2023 change in Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase attributed to the average balance and the average rate would be $1.7 billion and $(3.7) million respectively. The 2023 vs. 2022 change attributed to the average balance and the average rate would be $1.2 billion and $246.6 million respectively.\nNotes:    Net Interest Income (FTE), a non-GAAP financial measure, includes adjustments to a fully taxable equivalent basis for Loans and Leases, Securities and Other Interest-Earning Assets. The adjustments are based on a federal income tax rate of 21.0%, where the rate is adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of related federal tax benefit. Total taxable equivalent interest adjustments amounted to $31.8 million in 2024, $57.5 million in 2023 and $45.6 million in 2022. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income and net interest margin on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income and net interest margin on an FTE basis (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) is provided in “Supplemental Information—Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent” within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interest-earning assets. \nInterest revenue on cash collateral positions is reported above within Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks, within Loans and Leases, and within Other Interest-Earning Assets. Interest expense on cash collateral positions is reported above within Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits. Related cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties is recorded net of the associated derivative contract in Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively.\nNet Interest Income in 2024 increased from 2023. Net Interest Income, stated on an FTE basis, increased from 2023, due to a higher net interest margin and higher levels of average earning assets. Average earning assets in 2024 increased from 2023, primarily due to higher client deposits, partially offset by lower borrowing activity, the net of which resulted in higher funding of earning assets.\nThe net interest margin in 2024 increased from 2023. The net interest margin on an FTE basis in 2024 increased from 2023, primarily due to higher average interest rates and a favorable funding mix shift. \n46\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFederal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits averaged $35.2 billion in 2024, which increased $4.0 billion, or 13%, from $31.2 billion in 2023, due to deposit inflows. Interest-Bearing Due From and Deposits with Banks averaged $4.8 billion in 2024 and $4.3 billion in 2023. Average Securities were $50.1 billion and increased $0.2 billion, or 0%, from $49.9 billion in 2023. Average taxable Securities were $43.9 billion in 2024 and $46.8 billion in 2023. Average nontaxable Securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from U.S. federal and state income taxes, were $6.2 billion in 2024 and $3.1 billion in 2023.   \nLoans averaged $40.9 billion in 2024, which decreased $1.2 billion, or 3%, from $42.2 billion in 2023, primarily reflecting lower levels of commercial and institutional and non-U.S. loans, partially offset by higher levels of commercial real estate and private client loans. Commercial and institutional loans averaged $11.1 billion in 2024 and decreased $1.3 billion, or 11%, from $12.4 billion for 2023. Non-U.S. loans averaged $3.0 billion in 2024 and decreased $360.9 million, or 11%, from $3.4 billion for 2023. Residential real estate loans averaged $6.4 billion in both 2024 and 2023. Commercial real estate loans averaged $5.3 billion in 2024 and increased $316.8 million, or 6%, from $5.0 billion for 2023. Private client loans averaged $14.2 billion in 2024 and increased $171.0 million, or 1%, from $14.0 billion for 2023.\nAverage Other Interest-Earning Assets include certain community development investments, collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, money market investments, and Federal Reserve stock of $854.8 million, $1,369.3 million, $335.1 million, $92.3 million, and $70.0 million, respectively, which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.  \nNorthern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased $8.4 billion, or 10%, to $95.9 billion in 2024 from $87.5 billion in 2023. Interest expense for Interest-Bearing Deposits in the current year was driven by higher interest rates and higher balances. Average Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits comprised 67% and 69% of total average Interest-Bearing Deposits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average Total Interest-Bearing Liabilities increased $4.2 billion, or 4%, to $112.9 billion in 2024 from $108.7 billion in 2023. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. Average net noninterest-bearing funds decreased $0.6 billion, or 3%, to $21.5 billion in 2024 from $22.1 billion in 2023, primarily resulting from lower levels of Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits. Average Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits decreased $1.0 billion, or 5%, to $16.8 billion in 2024 from $17.7 billion in 2023. The average rate on total source of funds was 5.65% in 2024 and 4.07% in 2023.\nStockholders’ Equity\nStockholders’ Equity averaged $12.3 billion in 2024, compared with $11.5 billion in 2023. The increase in average Stockholders’ Equity of $803.0 million, or 7%, was primarily due to higher Retained Earnings.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024\n, the Corporation maintained its quarterly common stock dividend at $0.75 per share. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024\n, the Corporation, through common stock dividends and repurchases of 10,489,770 shares of common stock, returned $1.5 billion in capital to common stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation, through common stock dividends and repurchases of 4,384,678 shares of common stock, returned $977.7 million in capital to common stockholders. \nThe Corporation’s current stock repurchase authorization to repurchase up to 25.0 million shares was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2021. Shares are repurchased by the Corporation to, among other things, manage the Corporation’s capital levels. Repurchased shares are used for general purposes, including the issuance of shares under stock option and other equity incentive plans. The repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors has no expiration date, thus the Corporation retains the ability to resume repurchases thereunder when circumstances warrant and applicable regulations permit. Please refer to Note 13, “Stockholders’ Equity,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThere was a negative Provision for Credit Losses of $3.0 million in 2024, as compared to a Provision for Credit Losses of $24.5 million in 2023. The negative provision during 2024 resulted from decreases in both individual and collective reserves. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one Commercial loan charge-off. The decrease in collective reserves was primarily in held to maturity securities driven by methodology changes and improvements in portfolio quality partially offset by an increase in the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio, driven by deterioration in portfolio quality. The prior-year provision primarily reflected an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis within the CRE portfolio, driven by an increase in the size and duration of the portfolio, weaker economic projections for the industry, methodology updates, and credit quality deterioration on a small number of loans.\nNet charge-offs in 2024 totaled $11.3 million resulting from $15.5 million of charge-offs and $4.2 million of recoveries, compared to net charge-offs of $5.0 million in 2023 resulting from $8.7 million of charge-offs and $3.7 million of recoveries.

Severance-related charges were $81.8 million in 2024 as compared to $36.7 million in 2023. Full-time equivalent employees totaled approximately 23,300 at December 31, 2024, up 1% from approximately 23,100 at December 31, 2023. \nOutside Services\nOutside Services expense in 2024 increased from 2023, primarily reflecting higher consulting services and higher technical services. \nEquipment and Software\nEquipment and Software expense in 2024 increased from 2023, primarily due to higher software amortization and higher software support and rental expense.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy expense in 2024 decreased from 2023, primarily due to charges related to early lease exists recorded during the prior-year period.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther Operating Expense in 2024 decreased from 2023 primarily due to an $84.6 million FDIC special assessment and a $25.6 million charge related to the write-off of an investment in a client capability, both recorded in the prior year, partially offset by a $70.0 million charitable contribution, a $10.6 million legal settlement, and $14.7 million of additional expense related to the FDIC special assessment, recorded in the current year. Please refer to Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilitie\ns”\n included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional details related to the FDIC special assessment.\nPlease refer to Note 19, “Other Operating Expense” included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional details related to other operating expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe 2024 Provision for Income Taxes was $628.4 million, representing an effective rate of 23.6%. This compares with a Provision for Income Taxes of $357.5 million and an effective rate of 24.4% in 2023.\nSee Note 20, “Income Taxes,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for more information on income taxes.\n48\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nREPORTING SEGMENTS AND RELATED \nINFORMATION\nThe following information summarizes our consolidated results of operations by reporting segment for 2024 compared to 2023. For a discussion related to the consolidated results of operations by reporting segment for 2023 compared to 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our 2023 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.\n    Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management.   \nReporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on an FTE basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.\nEquity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. Allocations of equity and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. The accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments. Northern Trust’s presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.\nRevenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain corporate transactions and costs incurred associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment, which are reported within the Other segment.\nReporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis.  \nEffective January 2024, Northern Trust implemented certain enhancements to its FTP methodology, impacting the allocation of Net Interest Income to the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments. As a result, the approximate impact on the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments was a $132.0 million decrease and a $132.0 million increase in Net Interest Income, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. Prior-year segment results have not been revised to reflect this methodology change.\nThe following tables reflect the earnings contribution and certain average balances of Northern Trust’s reporting segments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n49\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 22: RESULTS OF REPORTING SEGMENTS\n($ In Millions)\nASSET SERVICING\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT\nFOR THE YEAR  ENDED DECEMBER 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNoninterest Income\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees\n$\n2,632.8\n$\n2,461.9\n$\n2,496.3\n$\n2,095.0\n$\n1,899.9\n$\n1,936.3\nForeign Exchange Trading Income (Loss)\n247.2\n213.0\n281.0\n(16.0)\n(9.1)\n7.6\nOther Noninterest Income\n271.9\n263.4\n250.7\n140.3\n150.8\n137.7\nTotal Noninterest Income\n3,151.9\n2,938.3\n3,028.0\n2,219.3\n2,041.6\n2,081.6\nNet Interest Income\n(1)\n1,216.0\n1,197.3\n1,072.7\n993.4\n842.2\n860.1\nRevenue\n(1)\n4,367.9\n4,135.6\n4,100.7\n3,212.7\n2,883.8\n2,941.7\nProvision for Credit Losses\n(4.6)\n0.5\n2.4\n8.8\n24.0\n9.6\nNoninterest Expense\nCompensation\n1,016.3\n970.2\n948.5\n578.0\n557.8\n520.4\nEmployee Benefits\n201.5\n197.1\n190.7\n87.7\n84.2\n86.8\nOutside Services\n437.0\n449.8\n433.5\n45.2\n41.9\n41.3\nAllocated Expense\n1,660.5\n1,469.5\n1,344.8\n1,202.5\n1,125.4\n1,109.2\nOther Segment Items\n(2)\n175.4\n186.6\n175.2\n77.6\n73.0\n57.8\nTotal Noninterest Expense\n3,490.7\n3,273.2\n3,092.7\n1,991.0\n1,882.3\n1,815.5\nIncome before Income Taxes\n(1)\n881.8\n861.9\n1,005.6\n1,212.9\n977.5\n1,116.6\nProvision for Income Taxes\n(1)\n193.7\n187.1\n243.2\n304.9\n245.9\n310.0\nNet Income\n$\n688.1\n$\n674.8\n$\n762.4\n$\n908.0\n$\n731.6\n$\n806.6\nPercentage of Consolidated Net Income\n34%\n61%\n57%\n45%\n66%\n60%\nAverage Assets\n$\n107,784.1\n$\n101,472.6\n$\n115,646.4\n$\n38,482.6\n$\n41,176.6\n$\n36,905.5\nAverage Loans\n$\n6,315.5\n$\n7,372.6\n$\n7,208.0\n$\n34,601.2\n$\n34,804.4\n$\n33,822.6\nAverage Deposits\n$\n86,775.3\n$\n81,812.6\n$\n96,166.1\n$\n25,558.2\n$\n23,432.9\n$\n29,426.3\n(1)\n Financial measures stated on an FTE basis. \n(2) \nOther Segment Items include Occupancy, Equipment & Software and Other Operating Expense.\n($ In Millions)\nOTHER\nTOTAL CONSOLIDATED\nFOR THE YEAR  ENDED DECEMBER 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNoninterest Income\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n4,727.8\n$\n4,361.8\n$\n4,432.6\nForeign Exchange Trading Income\n—\n—\n—\n231.2\n203.9\n288.6\nOther Noninterest Income (Loss)\n742.1\n(188.4)\n(235.6)\n1,154.3\n225.8\n152.8\nTotal Noninterest Income\n742.1\n(188.4)\n(235.6)\n6,113.3\n4,791.5\n4,874.0\nNet Interest Income\n(32.3)\n(57.5)\n(45.6)\n2,177.1\n1,982.0\n1,887.2\nRevenue\n709.8\n(245.9)\n(281.2)\n8,290.4\n6,773.5\n6,761.2\nProvision for Credit Losses\n(7.2)\n—\n—\n(3.0)\n24.5\n12.0\nNoninterest Expense\nCompensation\n876.8\n793.8\n779.1\n2,471.1\n2,321.8\n2,248.0\nEmployee Benefits\n128.6\n123.9\n159.9\n417.8\n405.2\n437.4\nOutside Services\n515.8\n414.8\n405.5\n998.0\n906.5\n880.3\nAllocated Expense\n(2,863.0)\n(2,594.9)\n(2,454.0)\n—\n—\n—\nOther Segment Items\n(1)\n1,494.0\n1,391.1\n1,184.2\n1,747.0\n1,650.7\n1,417.2\nTotal Noninterest Expense\n152.2\n128.7\n74.7\n5,633.9\n5,284.2\n4,982.9\nIncome before Income Taxes\n564.8\n(374.6)\n(355.9)\n2,659.5\n1,464.8\n1,766.3\nProvision for Income Taxes\n129.8\n(75.5)\n(122.9)\n628.4\n357.5\n430.3\nNet Income\n$\n435.0\n$\n(299.1)\n$\n(233.0)\n$\n2,031.1\n$\n1,107.3\n$\n1,336.0\nPercentage of Consolidated Net Income\n21%\n(27)%\n(17)%\n100%\n100%\n100%\nAverage Assets\n$\n366.8\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n146,633.5\n$\n142,649.2\n$\n152,551.9\nAverage Loans\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n40,916.7\n$\n42,177.0\n$\n41,030.6\nAverage Deposits\n$\n366.8\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n112,700.3\n$\n105,245.5\n$\n125,592.4\n(1) \nOther Segment Items include Occupancy, Equipment & Software and Other Operating Expense.\n50\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSegment results are stated on an FTE basis which has no impact on Net Income. Net Interest Income on an FTE basis includes FTE adjustments of $31.8 million, $57.5 million, and $45.6 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. A reconciliation of total consolidated revenue, Net Interest Income and net interest margin on a GAAP basis to revenue, Net Interest Income and net interest margin on an FTE basis, respectively, (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) is provided in “Supplemental Information—Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent” within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section. \n \nAsset Servicing\nAsset Servicing is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not limited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. \nAsset Servicing Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees\nFor an explanation of Asset Servicing Trust, Investment, and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment, and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section.\nAsset Servicing Foreign Exchange Trading Income\nForeign Exchange Trading Income for 2024 increased from 2023, primarily driven by higher client volumes.\nAsset Servicing Provision for Credit Losses\nThere was a negative Provision for Credit Losses of $4.6 million for 2024 compared to a Provision for Credit Losses of $0.5 million for 2023. The 2024 negative Provision for Credit Losses was primarily in the Commercial and Institutional (C&I) portfolio, driven by an improvement in credit quality. The Provision for Credit Losses during 2023 primarily reflected a deterioration in credit quality on a small number of loans at the time, offset by a better overall macroeconomic outlook.\nAsset Servicing Noninterest Expense\nAsset Servicing Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased in 2024 from 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher expense allocations and an increase in Compensation expense due to higher severance related charges.\nWealth Management\nWealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking. Wealth Management also includes Global Family Office, which provides customized services, including but not limited to: investment management; global custody; fiduciary; and private banking; family office consulting, and technology solutions, to meet the complex financial and reporting needs of ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices across the globe. Wealth Management is one of the largest providers of advisory services in the United States with AUC/A, assets under custody, and AUM of $1.1 trillion, $1.1 trillion, and $450.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in 19 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, Singapore and Abu Dhabi.\nWealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees\nFor an explanation of Wealth Management Trust, Investment, and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment, and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section.\nWealth Management Other Noninterest Income\nOther Noninterest Income for 2024 decreased from 2023, primarily due to lower credit-related fees and swap fees; partially offset by an increase in core brokerage related fees.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n51\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWealth Management Net Interest Income\nNet Interest Income on an FTE basis for 2024 increased from 2023, primarily due to the change in reporting segment allocation methodology beginning in 2024 noted above and higher deposit balances. Net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to 2.63% for 2024 from 2.20% in 2023. \nWealth Management Provision for Credit Losses\nThere was a Provision for Credit Losses of $8.8 million for 2024 compared to a Provision for Credit Losses of $24.0 million in 2023. The Provision for Credit Losses during 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the collective reserve, primarily in the C&I portfolio, driven by a small number of downgrades and increased duration, and the CRE portfolio, driven by exposure and portfolio quality; partially offset by a decrease in individual reserves, driven by a Commercial loan charge-off. The Provision for Credit Losses during 2023 reflected an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis relating to the CRE portfolio, driven by an increase in exposure and duration of the portfolio, weaker economic projections for the industry, methodology updates, and portfolio quality at the time.\nWealth Management Noninterest Expense\nWealth Management Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased in 2024 from 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher expense allocations and Compensation expense due to headcount and base pay adjustments.\nOther\nOther includes expenses for Asset Management, corporate and support functions not directly incurred by, but ultimately allocated back to, our two client-focused reporting segments. Income and expenses associated with non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments are retained within Other.  Other also includes the FTE adjustments of $31.8 million, $57.5 million, and $45.6 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, in order to reconcile the segment results that are reported on an internal management-reporting basis into consolidated results.\nOther—Noninterest Income (Loss)\nNoninterest Income (Loss) in 2024 primarily reflected  the gain related to the net impact from the Visa-related transactions and the gain related to the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by the loss on sale of available for sale debt securities arising from a repositioning of the portfolio in the first quarter of 2024. In the prior year, there was $169.5 million of losses on sales of available for sale debt securities recognized in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net, in conjunction with repositionings of the portfolio.\nOther—Noninterest Expense\nNoninterest Expense in 2024 included a $70.0 million charitable contribution to the Northern Trust Foundation, a $14.7 million expense related to the FDIC special assessment, a $10.6 million legal settlement, and non-allocated occupancy expense primarily arising from early lease exits.\nAsset Management\nAsset Management, through the Corporation’s various subsidiaries, supports the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management reporting segments by providing a broad range of asset management and related services and other products to clients around the world. Investment solutions are delivered through separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, exchange traded funds, non-U.S. collective investment funds, and unregistered private investment funds. Asset Management’s capabilities include active and passive equity; active and passive fixed income; cash management; multi-asset and alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds); and multi-manager advisory services and products. Asset Management’s activities also include overlay services and other risk management services. Asset Management operates internationally through subsidiaries and distribution arrangements and its revenue and expense are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management.\n52\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAt December 31, 2024, Northern Trust managed $1.6 trillion in assets for personal and institutional clients, including $1.2 trillion for Asset Servicing clients and $450.7 billion for Wealth Management clients.

In addition to the negative impact on Net Interest Income and the risk of credit losses, nonaccrual assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts. Changes in the level of nonaccrual assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the allowance evaluated on an individual basis and the quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the allowance evaluated on a collective basis within the allowance for credit losses.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses—which represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation. \nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. \nThe results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss Reserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic Research Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting business units. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Allowance for Credit Losses related to loans, undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets, was $168.0 million, $30.4 million, $6.5 million, and $1.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Allowance for Credit Losses related to loans, undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets, was $178.7 million,\n $26.9 million\n, $12.7 million, and $0.9 million, respectively.

These evaluations are based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay.\nThe allowance evaluated on an individual basis for Loans decreased $10.2 million from $13.4 million at December 31, 2023 to $3.2 million at December 31, 2024, primarily attributable to a commercial loan charge-off in 2024.\nAllowance Related to Credit Exposure Evaluated on a Collective Basis: \nThe allowance evaluated on a collective basis for loans decreased $0.5 million to $164.8 million at December 31, 2024, compared with $165.3 million at December 31, 2023. The allowance evaluated on a collective basis for undrawn loan commitments and letters of credit increased $3.5 million to $30.4 million at December 31, 2024, compared with $26.9 million at December 31, 2023, primarily in the C&I portfolio, driven by portfolio changes.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for 2024 totaled $745.5 million, of which $644.0 million was for software, $49.3 million was for computer hardware, $45.0 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $7.2 million was for furnishings. \nCapital expenditures for 2023 totaled $675.8 million, of which $559.3 million was for software, $56.4 million was for computer hardware, $56.0 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $4.1 million was for furnishings.\nSoftware amortization and depreciation on computer hardware are charged to Equipment and Software expense. Depreciation on building and leasehold improvements and on furnishings is charged to Occupancy expense and Equipment and Software expense, respective\nly. \nNorthern Trust’s technology investments support our core objectives to modernize the infrastructure, enhance resiliency, and develop capabilities so that we continue to deliver secure and innovative solutions to clients across the globe.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n63\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn addition to information technology, Northern Trust continues to invest in renovation and relocation projects to optimize our real estate footprint and modernize our existing offices for new ways of working. \nDeposits\nThe following table provides the scheduled maturity of total time deposits in denominations of $250,000 or greater at December 31, 2024.

These deposit amounts are derived by adding estimated U.S. office uninsured deposits as allowed by Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council instructions to all non-U.S. office deposits. Estimated uninsured U.S. office deposits are determined by calculating and totaling the deposits in excess of the deposit insurance limit on an individual account basis. \nShort-Term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings includes Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are either directly held by, or pledged to the counterparty until the repurchase. Northern Trust nets securities sold under agreements to repurchase against those purchased under agreements to resell when the requirements to net are met. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” Note 26, “Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase,” and Note 27, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.\nGeographic Area Information\nNorthern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source assets. Non-U.S. source assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\n64\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables present selected average assets and liabilities attributable to non-U.S. operations (based on the obligor’s domicile).

The increase in total deposits was primarily attributable to non-U.S. offices and savings certificates and other time deposits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of $7.2 billion was primarily attributable to decreased levels of total deposits. The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of savings, money market and other interest-bearing.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n65\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nOne of Northern Trust’s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients, counterparties, creditors, regulators and stockholders. A strong capital position helps Northern Trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments.\nSenior management, with oversight from the Capital Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and the full Board of Directors, is responsible for capital management and planning. Northern Trust manages its capital on both a total Corporation basis and a legal entity basis. The Capital Committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the Capital Policy approved by the Capital Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. In establishing the metrics related to capital, a variety of factors are taken into consideration, including the unique risk profiles of Northern Trust’s businesses, regulatory requirements, capital levels relative to peers, economic and market forecasts, and the impact on credit ratings.\nCapital levels increased in 2024 as average stockholders’ equity increased $803.0 million, or 7%, to $12.3 billion. Total stockholders’ equity was $12.8 billion at December 31, 2024, as compared to $11.9 billion at December 31, 2023. Preferred dividends totaling $41.8 million were declared in 2024. During 2024, the Corporation maintained its quarterly common stock dividend at $0.75 per common share. Common dividends totaling $608.4 million were declared in 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation repurchased 10,489,770 shares of common stock, including 424,806 shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at an average price per share of $89.41.\nIn accordance with Basel III requirements, capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the lower of each capital ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total risk-based capital and its risk-based capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. regulatory rules as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n66\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 37: CAPITAL ADEQUACY \n($ In Millions)\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nSTANDARDIZED APPROACH\nADVANCED APPROACH\nSTANDARDIZED APPROACH\nADVANCED APPROACH\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nCommon Stockholders’ Equity\n$\n11,903.5\n \n$\n11,903.5\n \n$\n11,013.1 \n$\n11,013.1 \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net of Deferred Tax Liability\n(699.0)\n(699.0)\n(722.2)\n(722.2)\nOther\n(166.3)\n(166.3)\n(111.5)\n(111.5)\nTotal Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\n11,038.2\n \n11,038.2\n \n10,179.4 \n10,179.4 \nAdditional Tier 1 Capital\nPreferred Stock\n884.8\n \n884.8\n \n884.9 \n884.9 \nOther\n(52.8)\n(52.8)\n(40.4)\n(40.4)\nTotal Additional Tier 1 Capital\n832.0\n \n832.0\n \n844.5 \n844.5 \nTotal Tier 1 Capital\n11,870.2\n \n11,870.2\n \n11,023.9 \n11,023.9 \nTier 2 Capital\nQualifying Allowance for Credit Losses\n205.9\n \n—\n \n219.2 \n— \nQualifying Subordinated Debt\n1,347.1\n \n1,347.1\n \n1,490.8 \n1,490.8 \nTotal Tier 2 Capital\n1,553.0\n \n1,347.1\n \n1,710.0 \n1,490.8 \nTotal Risk-Based Capital\n$\n13,423.2\n \n$\n13,217.3\n \n$\n12,733.9 \n$\n12,514.7 \nRisk-Weighted Assets\n(1)\n$\n88,939.7\n \n$\n75,920.9\n \n$\n89,527.4 \n$\n75,980.0 \nTotal Assets – End of Period (EOP)\n155,508.4\n \n155,508.4\n \n150,783.1 \n150,783.1 \nAdjusted Average Fourth Quarter Assets\n(2)\n145,666.8\n \n145,666.8\n \n135,701.9 \n135,701.9 \nTotal Loans – EOP\n43,390.6\n \n43,390.6\n \n47,617.0 \n47,617.0 \nCommon Stockholders’ Equity to:\nTotal Loans – EOP\n27.43\n \n%\n27.43\n \n%\n23.13 \n%\n23.13 \n%\nTotal Assets – EOP\n7.65\n \n7.65\n \n7.30 \n7.30 \nRisk-Based Capital Ratios\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\n12.4\n \n%\n14.5\n \n%\n11.4 \n%\n13.4 \n%\nTier 1 Capital\n13.3\n \n15.6\n \n12.3 \n14.5 \nTotal Capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2)\n15.1\n \n17.4\n \n14.2 \n16.5 \nTier 1 Leverage\n8.1\n \n8.1\n \n8.1 \n8.1 \nSupplementary Leverage\nN/A\n8.9\n \nN/A\n8.6 \n(1) \nRisk-weighted assets exclude, as applicable under each regulatory approach, amounts primarily related to goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and net unrealized gains or losses on securities and reflect adjustments for excess allowances for credit losses that have been excluded from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, if any.\n(2)\n Adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill, other intangible assets, and net unrealized gains or losses on securities.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded the requirements for classification as “well-capitalized” under applicable U.S. regulatory requirements. \nNorthern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to regulatory capital standards. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, capital adequacy reporting that deducts any net unrealized losses related to AFS securities from reported capital, and stringent, annual company-run and supervisory stress testing in the form of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercises, which confirms our ability to remain solvent under severely adverse market conditions. \nThe results of the 2024 DFAST, published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 26, 2024, resulted in Northern Trust’s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at 2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for the annual capital plan cycle, which began on October 1, 2024 and continues through September 30, 2025. \nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking regulators issued the Basel III Endgame Proposal, which would change how risk-based capital requirements are determined for banking organizations, including Northern Trust. The proposal would eliminate the existing advanced approach methodologies for determining RWA and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach. The proposed rule has not been finalized and U.S. regulators have indicated their intent to revise and reissue the proposal. No time table has been provided for the re-proposal or its effective date. \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n67\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFurther information regarding the Corporation’s and the Bank’s capital ratios and the minimum requirements for classification as “well-capitalized” is provided in the “Supervision and Regulation—Capital Adequacy Requirements” section of Item 1, “Business,” and Note 32, “Regulatory Capital Requirements,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and actual results could differ from those estimates. The SEC has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on Northern Trust’s future financial condition and results of operations. Due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2024 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\nFor Northern Trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses—which represents management’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. The allowance for a financial asset that does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets is determined through an individual evaluation.\nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of Allowance for Credit Losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. \nThe Allowance for Credit Losses consists of the following components:\nAllowance Evaluated on a Collective Basis.\n Northern Trust utilizes a quantitative probability of default/loss given default approach for the calculation of its credit allowance on a collective basis. For each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the exposure at default for each projected quarter to determine the quantitative component of the allowance. The quantitative allowance is then reviewed within a comprehensive qualitative adjustment framework, through which management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology, and other factors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute an adjustment to the quantitative allowance for each segment and class of the loan portfolio.\nThe allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the Corporation’s financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan portfolio into segments and classes based on similar risk characteristics or risk monitoring methods. \nFor each class, the probability of default and loss given default are derived for each quarter of the remaining life of each instrument. For the first two years (the reasonable and supportable period), these factors are derived by applying quarterly macroeconomic projections using models developed from historical data on macroeconomic factors and loans with similar characteristics. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period, Northern Trust reverts to its long-run historical loss experience on a straight-line basis over four quarters. The projected exposure at default for every quarter is based on contractual balance projections as of each quarter-end, with adjustments made for potential draws on off-balance sheet commitments.\nEstimating expected lifetime losses requires the use of projected macroeconomic factors. The Corporation uses multiple forecasts approved by Northern Trust’s Macroeconomic Scenario Development Committee (MSDC). The baseline forecast aligns with the Corporation’s latest thinking on macroeconomic projections for the next eight quarters. An alternative scenario is also considered, which reflects a recession that incorporates the experiences of a wider set of historical economic cycles. The forecasts are probability-weighted at each evaluation period and are management’s best estimate of future economic projections at that time.\nThe allowance estimate is sensitive to changes in portfolio composition, portfolio quality, and macroeconomic forecasts. Increases in the amount of borrowing and material downgrades to the quality of the lending portfolio will \n68\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nincrease the reserve, all else equal. Similarly, deteriorating projections for macroeconomic conditions will increase the reserve. Macroeconomic factors that are particularly correlated to Northern Trust’s loan portfolio are GDP growth, unemployment, non-farm employment, corporate profits, consumer spending, personal income, commercial real estate prices, credit spreads, and market volatility. To demonstrate the sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic conditions, Northern Trust applied a 100% probability weighting to downturn conditions, resulting in an increase to the collective component of the allowance for the loan portfolio of approximately $126.5 million. The investment security and other financial assets portfolios are less sensitive to macroeconomic factors in terms of overall reserve impact due to factors such as high credit quality, short duration, and low historical losses. \nThe commercial and institutional (C&I) portfolio utilizes Northern Trust’s internal borrower rating assessments to determine initial credit quality. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of upgrades or downgrades by shifting the rating up or down by one rating class, assuming no changes to other factors, such as macroeconomic projections or qualitative adjustments. The analysis excludes defaulted loans and does not assume a default event; hence, borrowers in the lowest non-default rating class were not downgraded. Similarly, those in the highest rating class could not be upgraded. Assuming the final forecast probability weighting, the collective component of the allowance assigned to the C&I portfolio would increase by approximately $77.6 million if all C&I borrowers were downgraded by one performing rating class. The C&I collective allowance would decrease by approximately $38.9 million if borrower ratings were upgraded by one rating class. \nThe results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss Reserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic Research Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting business units. The Credit Loss Reserve Committee determines the probability weights applied to each forecast approved by MSDC, and also reviews and approves qualitative adjustments to the collective allowance in line with Northern Trust’s qualitative adjustment framework.\nAllowance Evaluated on an Individual Basis.\n The allowance evaluated on an individual basis is determined through individual evaluations of loans and lending-related commitments that have defaulted, generally those with Borrower Ratings of 8 and 9. These evaluations are based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrowers’ ability to pay. For defaulted loans for which the amount of allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.\nPension Plan Accounting\nNorthern Trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees (U.S. Qualified Plan) and a U.S. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (U.S. Non-Qualified Plan). Certain European-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. Measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarial-based projections relating to the plans. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. Pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the average remaining service pe\nriod of active participants or over the expected remaining lifetime of plan participants for plans that have been previously frozen. A\ns a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods.\nNorthern Trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. These procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries. In addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.\nIn determining the pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Plan and for the U.S. Non-Qualified Plan in 2024, Northern Trust utilized a discount rate of 5.03% and 4.95% as of December 31, 2023, respectively. For both plans, the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averaged 5.56%. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. Qualified Plan assets was 7.25% as of December 31, 2023.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n69\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn evaluating pension-related assumptions for the U.S. pension plans as of Northern Trust’s December 31, 2024 measurement date, the following were considered:\n•\nDiscount Rate:\n Northern Trust estimates the discount rate for its U.S. pension plans by applying the plan specific projected cash flows for future benefit payments for each plan to the Aon AA Above Median yield curve as of the measurement date. This yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. Zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for AA-rated corporate bonds. This yield curve model referenced by Northern Trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 5.70% and 5.55% at December 31, 2024 for the U.S. Qualified and U.S. Non-Qualified Plans, respectively.\n•\nCompensation Level:\n Based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption is, consistent with prior year, based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averages 5.56%.\n•\nRate of Return on Plan Assets:\n The expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. As a result of these analyses, Northern Trust’s rate of return assumption for the U.S. Qualified Plan continues to be 7.25% for 2025.\n•\nMortality Table:\n Northern Trust had adopted the aggregate Pri-2012 mortality table with a 2012 base year in 2019. Northern Trust’s pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale MP-2021, which was released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2021. As in prior year, no change to these assumptions was made in 2024 since the Society of Actuaries did not release any updates to its mortality tables and improvement scales in 2024 due to the still uncertain long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the IRS prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2025.\nNet pension expense in 2025 is expected to increase slightly by approximately\n $1.0 million, p\nrimarily driven by higher amortization of previously incurred asset losses, partially offset by the positive expense impacts from higher discount rates and the $125 million contribution made to the U.S. Qualified Plan at the beginning of 2025.\nIn order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected U.S pension plans’ 2025 periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024, the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of the assumptions by 25 basis points.\nTABLE 38: SENSITIVITY OF U.S. PENSION PLANS ASSUMPTIONS \n(In Millions)\n25 BASIS\nPOINT INCREASE\n25 BASIS\nPOINT DECREASE\nIncrease (Decrease) in 2025 Pension Expense\nDiscount Rate Change\n$\n(2.7)\n$\n2.8 \nCompensation Level Change\n2.4 \n(2.3)\nRate of Return on Plan Assets Change\n(3.9)\n3.9 \nIncrease (Decrease) in December 31, 2024 Projected Benefit Obligation\nDiscount Rate Change\n(30.0)\n31.4 \nCompensation Level Change\n9.1 \n(8.8)\nPension Contributions.\n The deduction limits specified by the Internal Revenue Code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “Target Liability” under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Northern Trust contributed to the U.S. Qualified Plan $125.0 million for the 2025 plan year and $200.0 million for the 2024 plan year at the beginning of 2025 and 2024, respectively. The remaining maximum deductible contribution for 2025 is estimated at $255.0 million. The minimum required contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan is expected to be zero for 2025. \n70\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 enhances disclosures by further disaggregating existing annual income tax disclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2023-09 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (ASU 2024-03). ASU 2024-03 requires disaggregated disclosures in tabular format for specific income statement expense categories as well as a narrative disclosure about selling expenses. The amendments in ASU 2024-03 do not change or remove existing income statement presentation or disclosure requirements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2024-03 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments” (ASU 2024-04). The amendments in ASU 2024-04 provide additional guidance for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments with conversion terms that differ from the instruments’ preexisting terms should be accounted for as an induced conversion or extinguishment of convertible debt. ASU 2024-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-04 is not expected to have a significant impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. \nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk Management Overview\nNorthern Trust employs an integrated risk management framework to enable a risk-informed profile and support its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. The framework provides a methodology to identify, manage, report and govern both internal and external risks to Northern Trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness and good conduct across the organization. Northern Trust’s risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and conduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization. Northern Trust cultivates a culture of effective risk management by defining and embedding risk management accountabilities in all employee performance expectations and provides training, development and performance rewards to reinforce this culture.\nNorthern Trust’s risk management framework contains three inter-related elements, designed to support consistent enterprise risk identification, management and reporting: a comprehensive risk inventory, a static taxonomy of risk categories and a dynamic taxonomy of risk themes. The risk inventory is a detailed register of the risks inherently faced by Northern Trust. The risk categories and risk themes are classification systems used for classifying and managing the risk inventory and enabling different risk profile views. All identified risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business activities are cataloged into the following risk categories: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, liquidity, market, and strategic risk. All material risks are also dynamically cataloged into various risk themes which are defined groupings that share common characteristics, focus on business outcomes and span across risk categories.\nNorthern Trust implements its risk management framework through a “three lines of defense” operating model, embedding a robust risk management capability within its businesses. The model, used to communicate risk management expectations across the organization, contains three roles, each with a complementary level of risk management accountability. Within this operating model, Northern Trust’s businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. The Risk Management function, the second line of defense, sets the direction for Northern Trust’s risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. Audit Services, the third line of defense, provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated risk framework.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n71\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRisk Governance and Oversight Overview\nRisk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at Northern Trust, and includes clearly defined accountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. The following diagram provides a high-level overview of Northern Trust’s risk governance structure, highlighting oversight by the Board of Directors and key risk-related committees.\nTABLE 39: RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE \nNorthern Trust Corporation Board of Directors\nAudit Committee\nBusiness Risk Committee\nCapital Governance Committee\nHuman Capital and Compensation Committee\n–\nCybersecurity Risk Oversight Subcommittee\nGlobal Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC)\nCredit Risk Committee\nMarket & Liquidity Risk Committee\nOperational Risk Committee\nFiduciary Risk Committee\nCompliance & Ethics Oversight Committee\nInformation Technology Risk Committee\nModel Risk Oversight Committee\nThe Board of Directors provides oversight of risk management directly and through certain of its committees: the Audit Committee, the Business Risk Committee, the Capital Governance Committee and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee. \nThe Board of Directors annually approves Northern Trust’s Risk Management Framework and Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. \nThe Audit Committee\n provides oversight with respect to financial reporting and legal risk. \nThe Business Risk Committee\n assumes primary responsibility and oversight with respect to credit risk, operational risk, fiduciary risk, compliance risk, market risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk, and associated risk themes. The Cybersecurity Risk Oversight Subcommittee is a subcommittee of the Business Risk Committee and assists the Business Risk Committee in discharging its duties with respect to risks related to cybersecurity inherent in Northern Trust’s businesses. \nThe Human Capital and Compensation Committee\n oversees the development and operation of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation program. The Committee annually reviews management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the design and performance of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing incentives that are consistent with Northern Trust’s safety, soundness, and culture. This assessment includes an evaluation of whether Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior by participants. \nThe Capital Governance Committee\n assists the Board of Directors in discharging its oversight duties with respect to capital management and resolution planning activities. Among other responsibilities, the Capital Governance Committee oversees Northern Trust’s capital management assessments, forecasting, and stress testing processes and activities, including the annual CCAR exercise, and challenges management, as appropriate, on various elements of such processes and activities. Accordingly, the Capital Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to Northern Trust’s linkage of material risks to the capital adequacy assessment process.\n72\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO) oversees Northern Trust’s management of risk and compliance, promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are identified, understood, appropriately monitored and mitigated. The CRO reports directly to the Business Risk Committee and the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer. The CRO regularly advises the Business Risk Committee and reports to the Committee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. In accordance with the risk management framework, the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, Head of Financial Risk, Head of Non-Financial Risk, Head of Strategic Risk, Chief Fiduciary Risk Officer, International Chief Risk Officer, Head of Enterprise Risk Management, Chief Executive Officer, President—Asset Management, President—Asset Servicing, President—Wealth Management, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer and Chief Operating Officer, meet as the Global Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC) to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk and risk themes within Northern Trust. The Chief Audit Executive, or such officer’s designee, and the General Counsel, or such officer’s designee, are invited to attend each GERC meeting as a non-voting member. All other members of the executive management team of the Corporation are also standing invitees. Among other risk management responsibilities, GERC receives reports, escalations, or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. Senior risk committees include:\nThe Credit Risk Committee (CRC)\n is the most senior credit committee at Northern Trust, with responsibility for establishing, approving, and monitoring credit-related policies and programs throughout the Bank. The Chief Credit Officer reports directly to the CRO, chairs the CRC, and heads the Credit Risk Management function at Northern Trust. \nThe Market & Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC) \noversees activities relating to the management of market and liquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge of related policies, key assumptions, and practices.\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC)\n provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the operational risk-related policies and developing and implementing the operational risk management framework and programs that support coordination of operational risk activities. \nThe Fiduciary Risk Committee (FRC)\n is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities. \nThe Compliance & Ethics Oversight Committee (CEOC)\n provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the Corporation. \nThe Information Technology Risk Committee (ITRC) \nprovides oversight and direction with respect to information security, technology and cyber risk. The committee is responsible for recommending the policies related to, and overseeing development and implementation of the risk management framework, standards and processes supporting coordination and governance of, information security, technology and cyber risk management activities.\nThe Model Risk Oversight Committee (MROC) \nis responsible for providing management attention, direction, and oversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within Northern Trust.\nIn addition to the aforementioned committees, Northern Trust establishes business and regional risk committees, as well as a Swap Dealer Risk Committee, that also report into GERC.\nRisk Assessment, Appetite and Reporting Processes\nAs part of the integrated risk framework, Northern Trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes, embedded within its businesses to enable a risk-informed profile that supports its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. Northern Trust’s risk assessment process consists of a series of programs across the first and second lines of defense that identify, measure, manage and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines.\nNorthern Trust defines its risk appetite as the aggregate level and types of risk the Board of Directors and senior management are willing to assume to achieve the Corporation’s strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with prudent management of risk and applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. It includes consideration of the likelihood and impact of risks, using both monetary loss and non-financial measures across risk themes to monitor against tolerance thresholds and guideline levels that trigger escalation to risk committees, senior management, and the Board of Directors or committees thereof, as appropriate.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n73\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRisk Control\nRisk Control is an internal, independent review function within the Risk Management function. Risk Control is managed by the Head of Risk Control and is comprised of Model Risk Management, Credit Review, and Global Compliance Testing groups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. Model Risk Management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-validating existing models. Credit Review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across Northern Trust. Lastly, Global Compliance Testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding Northern Trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities. The Business Risk Committee has oversight responsibility with respect to Risk Control generally as well as each of these groups.\nAudit Services\nAudit Services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within Northern Trust’s risk management framework. Audit Services is managed by the Chief Audit Executive with oversight from the Audit Committee. Audit Services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the framework on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the Audit Committee. Audit Services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. The Chief Audit Executive reports directly to the Audit Committee and administratively reports to the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and is a non-voting member of GERC.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower, issuer, or counterparty to perform on an obligation.\nCredit Risk Overview\nCredit risk is inherent in many of Northern Trust’s activities. The bulk of credit risk relates to loans, securities, and wholesale counterparty-related exposures, such as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing activities. Northern Trust’s loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large U.S. financial institutions in that Northern Trust is generally:\n•\nnot an originator of loan products intended to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations;\n•\nnot an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and\n•\nnot a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, hedge fund leveraging, loans to private equity sponsored companies, or prime brokerage activities.\nCredit Risk Framework and Governance\nThe CRC is the most senior credit committee at Northern Trust, with responsibility for establishing, approving, and monitoring credit-related policies and programs throughout the Bank. The Chief Credit Officer reports directly to the CRO, chairs the CRC, and heads the Credit Risk Management function at Northern Trust. \nThe Credit Risk Management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the business units that manage client relationships, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. To monitor and control credit risk, the Credit Risk Management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and programs designed to promote a prudent credit culture and monitors adherence to those internal policies, standards, and programs, as well as external regulations. Independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by Risk Control.\nThe credit risk framework stipulates authority levels for approval of the extension of credit. Individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. Credit requests exceeding policies or standards because of amount, maturity, rating, or other conditions, are referred to the relevant Group Credit Approval Committee. Credit decisions involving requests in excess of Group Credit Approval Committee limits require the approval of the Senior Credit Committee. The Capital Markets Credit Committee has sole authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure limits to all wholesale market counterparties. The Senior Credit Committee and Capital Markets Credit Committee are both direct sub-committees of the CRC. The Treasury Credit Committee provides similar approval for investments in assets subject to credit risk, such as bonds and equities.\n74\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Risk Measurement\nThe credit risk framework covers a number of different measurements of credit risk at Northern Trust, including RWA, the allowance for credit losses, and stress tests using various macroeconomic scenarios, such as the internal capital adequacy approval program and CCAR. \nAn integral component of credit risk measurement is Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system. Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of the Corporation’s credit risk. Calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default (PD) and  exposure-specific information about loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD), and maturity. Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any direct linkage to external credit ratings.\nObligors are assigned PDs after consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Although the criteria vary, the objective is for assigned PDs to be consistent in the measurement and ranking of risk. LGD and EAD are assigned based on obligor, product, collateral and instrument characteristics. \nRisk ratings are assigned at the time a counterparty or an obligation is approved, renewed, or amended. Risk ratings are reviewed annually or when new information relevant to the rating is received. Risk ratings are utilized for credit underwriting, management reporting, and the calculation of regulatory capital.\nThe Credit Risk Management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. Independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of Risk Control.\nLoans and Other Extensions of Credit\nA significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. These contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nUndrawn commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. The following table provides information about the industry sector and expiration dates of undrawn commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n75\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 40: UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BY INDUSTRY SECTOR \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nCOMMITMENTS\nCOMMITMENTS\n(In Millions)\nTOTAL\nONE YEAR\nAND LESS\nOVER ONE\nYEAR\nOUTSTANDING\nLOANS\nTOTAL\nONE YEAR\nAND LESS\nOVER ONE\nYEAR\nOUTSTANDING\nLOANS\nCommercial\nCommercial and Institutional\n(1)\nFinance and Insurance\n$\n3,936.8\n \n$\n1,928.3\n \n$\n2,008.5\n \n$\n927.0\n \n$\n3,536.8 \n$\n1,664.0 \n$\n1,872.8 \n$\n1,109.3 \nHolding Companies\n7.4\n \n—\n \n7.4\n \n31.9\n \n— \n— \n— \n28.9 \nManufacturing\n6,255.5\n \n873.9\n \n5,381.6\n \n1,231.2\n \n6,551.9 \n1,104.3 \n5,447.6 \n1,619.1 \nMining\n472.5\n \n24.5\n \n448.0\n \n33.5\n \n461.8 \n29.8 \n432.0 \n29.8 \nPrivate Equity\n2,414.8\n \n2,110.7\n \n304.1\n \n3,154.6\n \n2,740.4 \n1,888.9 \n851.5 \n3,248.9 \nPublic Administration\n50.0\n \n50.0\n \n—\n \n0.9\n \n50.0 \n50.0 \n— \n28.1 \nRetail Trade\n882.5\n \n323.7\n \n558.8\n \n204.6\n \n1,003.8 \n382.2 \n621.6 \n244.2 \nServices\n5,671.2\n \n2,551.6\n \n3,119.6\n \n3,812.6\n \n6,133.1 \n2,528.1 \n3,605.0 \n4,041.7 \nTransportation and Warehousing\n318.9\n \n75.0\n \n243.9\n \n242.8\n \n239.9 \n3.7 \n236.2 \n273.2 \nUtilities\n1,363.1\n \n9.6\n \n1,353.5\n \n73.5\n \n1,246.3 \n8.5 \n1,237.8 \n36.8 \nWholesale Trade\n739.9\n \n15.2\n \n724.7\n \n491.6\n \n759.2 \n60.0 \n699.2 \n510.4 \nOther Commercial\n141.8\n \n93.4\n \n48.4\n \n332.9\n \n159.7 \n49.5 \n110.2 \n384.9 \nCommercial and Institutional\n22,254.4\n \n8,055.9\n \n14,198.5\n \n10,537.1\n \n22,882.9 \n7,769.0 \n15,113.9 \n11,555.3 \nCommercial Real Estate\n376.5\n \n139.1\n \n237.4\n \n5,314.2\n \n413.0 \n58.3 \n354.7 \n5,134.2 \nNon-U.S.\nOther Non-US\n1,549.3\n \n898.7\n \n650.6\n \n1,143.9\n \n1,340.4 \n677.7 \n662.7 \n1,543.0 \nPrivate Equity \n210.1\n \n141.6\n \n68.5\n \n970.0\n \n446.2 \n446.2 \n— \n1,235.5 \nNon-U.S.\n1,759.4\n \n1,040.3\n \n719.1\n \n2,113.9\n \n1,786.6 \n1,123.9 \n662.7 \n2,778.5 \nOther\n83.5\n \n83.5\n \n—\n \n2,313.6\n \n87.5 \n87.5 \n— \n5,944.8 \nTotal Commercial\n24,473.8\n \n9,318.8\n \n15,155.0\n \n20,278.8\n \n25,170.0 \n9,038.7 \n16,131.3 \n25,412.8 \nPersonal\nPrivate Client\n2,635.2\n \n995.8\n \n1,639.4\n \n15,848.8\n \n3,876.2 \n2,033.6 \n1,842.6 \n14,360.0 \nResidential Real Estate\n679.5\n \n214.0\n \n465.5\n \n6,109.9\n \n804.2 \n251.3 \n552.9 \n6,327.1 \nNon-U.S.\n354.3\n \n321.0\n \n33.3\n \n674.7\n \n908.7 \n525.9 \n382.8 \n428.8 \nOther\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n478.4\n \n— \n— \n— \n1,088.3 \nTotal Personal\n3,669.0\n \n1,530.8\n \n2,138.2\n \n23,111.8\n \n5,589.1 \n2,810.8 \n2,778.3 \n22,204.2 \nTotal\n$\n28,142.8\n \n$\n10,849.6\n \n$\n17,293.2\n \n$\n43,390.6\n \n$\n30,759.1 \n$\n11,849.5 \n$\n18,909.6 \n$\n47,617.0 \n(1) \nThe commercial and institutional industry sector information is presented on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\nAs part of Northern Trust’s credit processes, the Credit Risk Management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. This approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. An integral part of the Credit Risk Management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonaccrual status or charged off. Northern Trust maintains a loan portfolio “watch list” for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonaccrual credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. Independent from the Credit Risk Management function, Credit Review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate the effectiveness of management’s implementation of Credit Risk Management’s requirements.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nCounterparty credit risk for Northern Trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities, including trading OTC foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives, indemnified securities lending transactions, and sponsored repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. Credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.\nTo calculate exposure, Northern Trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, indemnified securities lending, and sponsored repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as repo-style transactions. Foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as OTC derivatives. The exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on regulatory requirements.\n76\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Risk Mitigation\nNorthern Trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. However, Northern Trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. Northern Trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories.\nPhysical and Financial Collateral:\n One of Northern Trust’s primary credit risk mitigation approaches is the requirement of collateral. Residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. Various other types of physical and financial collateral are also accepted for certain commercial and personal loans, in line with Northern Trust’s lending standards. In cases where loans to clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies.\nNetting:\n On-balance sheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting arrangements. Netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting arrangements. \nGuarantees:\n Personal and corporate guarantees are accepted, as warranted, to reduce risk of default, facilitate potential collection efforts, and protect Northern Trust’s claims relative to other creditors. \nAnother important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. Processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events.\nOperational Risk Overview\nOperational risk is inherent in each of Northern Trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, challenges related to reliance on third parties, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions or catastrophes to result in losses. This includes the potential that continuity of service and resilience may be impacted.\nOperational risk includes information technology and cybersecurity, compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the Corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.\nOperational Risk Framework and Governance\nTo monitor and control operational risk, Northern Trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the Corporation’s operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. The framework implements a structured approach to establishing and communicating operational risk management practices and responsibilities. This structured approach to measuring and managing operational risk addresses operational resilience which requires that Northern Trust minimize service disruptions and limit systemic impacts from adverse events as well as risk quantification. The framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that influence risk and drive action to maintain operational resilience and reduce future loss events. The Operational Risk Management function operates within the independent Non-Financial Risk function and is responsible for defining the operational risk management framework and providing independent oversight of the framework implementation and application across Northern Trust. It is the responsibility of each business and corporate function to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk framework and business and function-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, manage and report on operational risk and mitigate Northern Trust’s exposure to disruption and loss. Several key programs support the operational risk framework, including:\n•\nLoss Event Data Program\n - a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses, and operational risk quantification, including the Basel Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) capital quantification. Both internal and external loss data are used in the operational risk capital quantification. Data is reviewed to increase understanding of Northern Trust’s and industry-wide operational risk exposure and to identify action plans to minimize or prevent future events.\n•\nRisk and Control Self-Assessment\n - a comprehensive, structured risk management process used by Northern Trust’s businesses and corporate functions to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate operational risk exposures throughout the enterprise.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n77\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n•\nOperational Risk Scenario Analysis\n - a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible operational losses. \n•\nProduct and Process Risk Management Program\n - a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified products and services and with significant changes to operating processes.\n•\nOperational Resilience\n - a program designed to ensure the resilience and continuity of service delivery of Northern Trust’s most important business services.\n•\nThird-Party Risk Management Program\n - a program that provides processes for evaluating, quantifying and qualifying appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of third and fourth parties (inclusive of external and internal, e.g., Northern Trust legal entity to legal entity relationships).\n•\nGlobal Fraud Risk\n - a program designed to prevent, detect and respond to attempted or actual fraud impacting the bank and its clients globally.\n•\nData Risk\n - a program that includes data management and data governance related activities in Northern Trust processes in order to manage the risk of compromised or degraded data availability and integrity.\n•\nData Privacy Program\n - a program that sets forth a consistent, global approach to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations relating to privacy and establishes overarching principles for the responsible use and protection of confidential information. \n•\nCyber and Technology Risk Management\n - a program that sets forth a consistent, global approach to communicate risk management processes and controls addressing cybersecurity (inclusive of information security), technology, and related compliance risks to the organization. Please see Item 1C, “Cybersecurity,” for a detailed discussion of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.\n•\nBusiness Continuity Management Program\n - a program designed to protect life safety, minimize and manage the business impact and support the recovery of critical functions for clients following an incident.\n•\nPhysical Security \n- a program that provides for the safety of Northern Trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide by setting and enforcing standards, providing training, establishing partnerships, and encouraging continual improvement in workplace security.\n•\nInsurance Management Program\n - a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events through the securing of appropriate insurance policy protection.\nAs discussed in “Risk Control” above, Model Risk Management also is part of the operational risk framework.\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC) is responsible for overseeing the activities of Northern Trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing and maintaining the Corporate Operational Risk Management Policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs. This committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to information technology, cybersecurity, compliance and fiduciary risks. The purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks. This includes identification and assessment of evolving risk trends across the operational risk framework and how these can be best managed.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nNorthern Trust utilizes the AMA capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the Corporation and applicable U.S. banking subsidiaries. Northern Trust’s AMA capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the Loss Event Data, Risk and Control Self-Assessment and Operational Risk Scenario Analysis programs to derive required capital. While internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification, external loss event data and qualitative risk and control self-assessments are also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital quantification process. Business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. The AMA capital quantification process uses a Loss Distribution Approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9\nth\n percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year time horizon.\nOperational Resilience and Recovery Management\nNorthern Trust’s operational resilience approach encompasses operational resilience and recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to anticipate and limit disruptions and to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption Northern Trust is able to resume critical business functions and fulfill all regulatory and legal requirements.\nNorthern Trust’s operational resilience mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resilience centers that offer alternative workstations and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability.\n78\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll of Northern Trust’s businesses are required to risk-assess all of their functions regularly and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. The business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to Northern Trust are reviewed on a regular basis. All of Northern Trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually. The ORC annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the Business Risk Committee. \nFiduciary Risk\nFiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure: (a) in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts; (b) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or (c) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. Fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship, and governing document.\nFiduciary Risk Overview\nThe fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors, and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant. Fiduciary risk is best managed at the source of the risk, and is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand, and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each client relationship for which Northern Trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. Each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards, and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite.\n \nFiduciary Risk Framework and Governance\nThe FRC is responsible for overseeing activities related to the exercise of fiduciary powers throughout the organization, and for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and the fiduciary risk framework that supports the coordination of activities to identify, monitor, manage, and report on fiduciary risk. In addition, the FRC serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.\nCompliance Risk\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to Northern Trust. Compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:\n•\nRegulatory risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements.\n•\nFinancial crime risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same.\nCompliance Risk Framework and Governance\nThe compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. The framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. The framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a Compliance and Ethics Program approved by the Business Risk Committee.\nEach business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the Compliance and Ethics Program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. Each business is responsible for its respective employees’ compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program.\nThe CEOC oversees and provides direction with respect to the implementation of Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program and the coordination of compliance initiatives across the enterprise. The CEOC approves policies necessary to effectively manage Regulatory and Financial Crime Risk. The Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer reports to the Business Risk Committee, as appropriate, and chairs the CEOC.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n79\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity Risk Overview\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events. Northern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to the same regulatory liquidity standards as U.S. GSIBs. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and other activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, daily Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and monthly Liquidity Stress-Testing calculations to regulators.\nNorthern Trust maintains a strong liquidity position and liquidity risk profile. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is primarily liability-driven. That is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits, which are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits and can also be influenced by market conditions. This liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model, where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of lending. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is generally comprised of high-quality assets that are managed to meet anticipated obligations under stress, resulting in low liquidity risk.\nLiquidity Risk Framework and Governance\nNorthern Trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All liquidity risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.\nThe Liquidity Management Policy and exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the Board of Directors, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as the LCR, the NSFR, and the liquidity stress-testing buffer across a range of time horizons. Treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes liquidity risk management strategies and is responsible for performing liquidity management activities. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) provides first-line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, LCR, NSFR, and stress test results. \nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first-line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. The Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC) provides second-line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market and liquidity risk exposures, approving and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement.\nLiquidity Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting\nLiquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. Various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by Northern Trust to better understand the nature and sources of its liquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management, cash flow projections, operational deposit modeling, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and contingency funding planning.\nThe liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. Both Northern Trust’s Treasury and Market and Liquidity Risk Management functions produce management reports that enable oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite. Holistic liquidity metrics such as LCR, NSFR and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile.\nRegulatory Environment\nNorthern Trust actively follows regulatory developments and regularly evaluates its liquidity risk management framework against proposed rule-making and industry best practices in order to comply with applicable regulations and further enhance its liquidity policies. Please refer to “Supervision and Regulation—Liquidity Standards” in Item 1, “Business,” for a discussion of applicable liquidity standards.\n80\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nU.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) \nThe LCR Final Rule requires covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation, to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs) equal to or greater than 100% of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day standardized supervisory liquid stress scenario. The requirements of the LCR Final Rule are intended to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations, improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The Corporation and the Bank each satisfied the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2024.\nU.S. Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\nThe NSFR Final Rule requires covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation, to maintain an amount of available stable funding (ASF) equal to or greater than the banking organization’s projected minimum funding needs, or required stable funding (RSF), over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR is designed to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a banking organization’s regular sources of funding will compromise its liquidity position, promote effective liquidity risk management, and support the ability of banking organizations to provide financial intermediation to businesses and households across a range of market conditions. The NSFR supports financial stability by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis, reducing the possibility that funding shocks would substantially increase distress at individual banking organizations. The Corporation and the Bank each satisfied the NSFR requirements during 2024.\nFunding\nNorthern Trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 62% and 59% of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The market value of unencumbered securities at the Bank, which include those placed at the central bank discount window, totaled $42.0 billion and $39.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Northern Trust manages its funding to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations and commitments. \nAs the Corporation’s principal subsidiary encompassing all of Northern Trust’s banking activities, the Bank centrally manages liquidity for all U.S. and international banking operations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, interest earned on investment securities and money market assets, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. While management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had over $36.9 billion and $34.7 billion, respectively of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. The Bank also is active in the U.S. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds.\nThe liquidity of the Corporation is managed separately from that of the Bank. The primary sources of cash for the Corporation are issuances of debt or equity and dividend payments from the Bank. For further information on issuances or redemptions of debt or equity, please refer to Note 12, “Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The Corporation received $3.1 billion of dividends and $850.0 million from the Bank in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dividends from the Bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in Note 30, “Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nThe Corporation’s liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was $2.4 billion and $795.6 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During, and at year-end, 2024 and 2023, these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the Bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the Corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. Average liquidity during 2024 and 2023 was $1.7 billion and $797.2 million, respectively. The cash flows of the Corporation are shown in Note 33, “Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation only),” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nUses of Liquidity\nLiquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit.\nThe Corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the Corporation’s stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. The most significant uses of cash by the Corporation during 2024 were $602.3 million of common stock dividends and $937.8 million of common stock repurchases. The most significant uses of cash by the Corporation during 2023 were $621.5 million of common stock dividends and $347.5 million of common stock repurchases.     \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n81\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Ratings\nA significant source of liquidity for both the Corporation and the Bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally. The credit ratings of the Corporation and the Bank as of December 31, 2024, provided in the following table, allow Northern Trust to access capital markets on favorable terms.\nTABLE 41: NORTHERN TRUST CREDIT RATINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31,\n \n2024 \nCREDIT RATING\nSTANDARD &\nPOOR’S\nMOODY’S\nFITCH RATINGS\nNorthern Trust Corporation:\nSenior Debt\nA+\nA2\nA+\nSubordinated Debt\nA\nA2\nA+\nPreferred Stock\nBBB+\nBaa1\nBBB\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nThe Northern Trust Company:\nShort-Term Deposit\nA-1+\nP-1\nF1+\nLong-Term Deposit/Debt\nAA-\nAa2\nAA\nSubordinated Debt\nA+\nA2\nA+\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nA significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit Northern Trust’s access to capital markets and/or increase the rates paid for short-term borrowings, including deposits, and future long-term debt issuances. The size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors, including the extent of the downgrade, Northern Trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions, current market conditions, and other factors. In addition, as discussed in Note 27, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Northern Trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain credit-risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels. At December 31, 2024, the net maximum amount of these termination payments that Northern Trust could have been required to pay was $158.8 million. Other than these credit-risk-related contingent derivative counterparty payments, Northern Trust had no long-term debt covenants or other credit-risk-related payments at December 31, 2024, that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPlease refer to Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information on off-balance sheet arrangements and the Credit Risk discussion in the “Risk Management” section for further detail on undrawn commitments.  \nMarket Risk\nThere are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk. Interest rate risk associated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in Net Interest Income and the market value of equity, including Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions.\nMarket Risk Framework and Governance\nNorthern Trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All market risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.\nThe Asset and Liability Management Policy, Policy on Dealer Trading Activities, and exposure limits for market risk are set by Board-level committees, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of Net Interest Income (NII), sensitivity of market value of equity (MVE), and value-at-risk (VaR) across a range of time horizons. \nTreasury, in the first line of defense, proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing market risk management activities. The ALCO provides first-line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, overseeing the execution of strategies, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, the liquidity coverage ratio and stress test results.\n82\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Market and Liquidity Risk Management function, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first-line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. The MLRC provides second-line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement.\nInterest Rate Risk Overview\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is the potential for deterioration in Northern Trust's financial position (e.g., interest income, market value of equity, or capital) due to changes in interest rates. NII and MVE sensitivity are the primary metrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on NII depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. Changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions, which directly impact the MVE. Higher interest rates may impact the fair value of available for sale debt securities which in turn affects Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) that can impact regulatory capital ratios. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are sufficiently correlated, which allows Northern Trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite.\nThere are four commonly recognized types of structural interest rate risk in the banking book:\n•\nrepricing risk, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;\n•\nyield curve risk, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;\n•\nbasis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and\n•\nembedded optionality risk, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.\nInterest Rate Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting\nNorthern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: NII and MVE sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet.  \nNorthern Trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the NII sensitivity and MVE sensitivity simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. A variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including:\n•\npurchase of investment securities;\n•\nsale of investment securities that are classified as available for sale;\n•\nissuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;\n•\ncollateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank; and\n•\nhedging with various types of derivative financial instruments.\nNII Sensitivity\nThe modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).\nThe NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the NII simulation:\n•\nthe balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment;\n•\nprepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;\n•\ncash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;\n•\nnonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and\n•\nnew business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n83\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and 100 and 200 basis point ramps downward in interest rates relative to forward rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. \nTABLE 42: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY\nINCREASE (DECREASE) ESTIMATED IMPACT ON NEXT TWELVE MONTHS OF NET INTEREST INCOME\n(In Millions)\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nINCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points\n$\n30\n \n$\n43 \n200 Basis Points\n53\n \n82 \nDECREASE IN INTEREST RATES BELOW MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points\n$\n(34)\n$\n(63)\n200 Basis Points\n(82)\n(150)\nThe NII sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. NII sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided.\nMVE Sensitivity\nMVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. The MVE looks at the whole balance sheet, which includes AFS debt securities, HTM debt securities, money market accounts, deposits, loans and wholesale borrowings. The potential effect of interest rate changes on MVE is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. Northern Trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures MVE sensitivity under various rate scenarios. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).\nThe MVE sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate MVE sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. Many of the assumptions that apply to NII sensitivity also apply to MVE sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the MVE simulation:\n•\nthe present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining lives, which are based on a combination of Northern Trust’s actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment—some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives;\n•\nthe present values of most noninterest-bearing balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their carrying values; and\n•\nMonte Carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths.\nThe following table shows the estimated impact on MVE of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and 100 and 200 basis point shocks down from current market implied forward rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. \nTABLE 43: MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SENSITIVITY  \nINCREASE (DECREASE) ESTIMATED IMPACT ON MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY\n(In Millions)\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nINCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points\n$\n(374)\n$\n(360)\n200 Basis Points\n(808)\n(817)\nDECREASE IN INTEREST RATES BELOW MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points\n$\n508\n \n$\n430 \n200 Basis Points\n951\n \n725 \n84\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe MVE simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. MVE sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided.\nForeign Currency Market Risk\nForeign Currency Non-Trading Risk Overview\nNorthern Trust’s balance sheet is exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S.-dollar-denominated revenue and expense. To manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, Northern Trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. If those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, Northern Trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure. \nTrading Market Risk\nWithin Market Risk, trading risk arises from providing foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives, and securities brokerage services to clients. Securities positions are limited and their trading risks are \nde minimis\n. For regulatory capital purposes, trading risk also includes foreign currency balances from business operations.\nTrading Book Composition and Risk Drivers\nNorthern Trust’s trading book is composed of positions arising from activity in four business areas: Global Foreign Exchange (GFX), which includes Treasury foreign exchange trades; Interest rate derivative (IRD) trades; Northern Trust Securities Inc. (NTSI) inventory; and foreign currency balances (FCBs) accrued on the balance sheet.\nGFX desks execute foreign exchange transactions for client accommodation purposes and mitigate most of the exposure via offsetting trades. In addition, Northern Trust’s Treasury department executes foreign exchange transactions to manage balance sheet flows. The risk system includes these within GFX and applies FX and interest rate (IR) drivers to produce VaR for regulatory capital.\nNorthern Trust’s Treasury Department executes IRD trades for client accommodation purposes and mitigates the exposure via offsetting trades. The risk system applies IR and volatility drivers to produce VaR for regulatory capital.\nFCBs arise not from executing trades but rather in the course of regular business operations, from non-U.S.-dollar-denominated revenues and expenses accruing onto the Corporation’s balance sheet. Prior to September 1, 2023, FX risk from these positions was mitigated through hedging activity. This hedging activity was discontinued on September 1, 2023. The risk system applies FX drivers to produce VaR for regulatory capital.\nNTSI, a brokerage subsidiary of the Corporation, executes fixed-income securities trades directly for client accounts. A small inventory of securities remains held in inventory overnight. This portfolio exposure is de minimis, and VaR calculations are not required. The valuation of the securities serves as the basis for calculating regulatory capital.\nForeign Currency Trading Risk Overview\nForeign currency or foreign exchange trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods. The GFX trading portfolio at Northern Trust is composed of spot, forward, non-deliverable forward, and foreign exchange rate (FX) swap transactions.\nInterest Rate Derivatives Trading Risk Overview\nIRD positions exist when aggregate interest cash inflows and outflows do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods. The IRD trading portfolio at Northern Trust is composed mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients’ interest rate risk management needs, but also including a small number of swaptions, caps, and floors. IRD risk measures during the second quarter of 2023 became temporarily inflated as a result of transitions of IRD contracts from LIBOR to SOFR referencing. The risk measures declined in the third quarter of 2023 as the bulk of transitions was completed.\nOther Non-material Trading Activities\nNorthern Trust’s broker-dealer subsidiary, NTSI, maintains a legacy portfolio of trading securities and invests excess cash balances in short-term investment vehicles. The portfolio averaged less than $0.1 million and less than $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n85\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTrading Book Risk Measurement\nFor trading book activities other than NTSI, Northern Trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a VaR model and applying the historical simulation methodology. This statistical model provides estimates, based on high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in interest rates and non-U.S. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. The model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies and interest rates. VaR is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.\nVaR measures are computed daily in a vendor software application which reads positions from Northern Trust’s trading systems and foreign currency balances from the general ledger. Data vendors provide foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and volatilities for all currencies. The Risk Management function monitors on a daily basis VaR model inputs and outputs for reasonableness.\nTrading Book Risk Monitoring, Reporting and Analysis\nNorthern Trust monitors several variations of the VaR measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. Variations include different methodologies (historical simulation, Monte Carlo simulation and Taylor approximation), horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels of 95% and 99%, subcomponent VaRs using only FX drivers, only IR drivers, and only volatility drivers, and look-back periods of one year, two years, and four years. Those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on Northern Trust’s market risks.\nAutomated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. The Risk Management function also reviews and reports several variations of the VaR measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk.\nThe following table presents the levels of total regulatory VaR and its subcomponents, covering GFX, foreign currency balances, and interest rate derivatives combined, in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally-weighted volatility. The total VaR is typically less than the sum of its three subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from interactions among the three drivers.\nTABLE 44: VALUE-AT-RISK \n(In Millions)\nCombined Trading \nBook VaR\nFX VaR \n(FX DRIVERS ONLY)\nIR VaR \n(IR DRIVERS ONLY)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nHigh\n$\n1.7\n \n$\n2.2 \n$\n1.9\n \n$\n1.9 \n$\n0.4\n \n$\n0.9 \nLow\n0.2\n \n0.1 \n0.1\n \n— \n0.1\n \n— \nAverage\n0.6\n \n0.6 \n0.5\n \n0.4 \n0.1\n \n0.2 \nAs of December 31,\n0.2\n \n0.2 \n0.2\n \n1.6 \n0.1\n \n0.1 \nDuring 2024 and 2023, Northern Trust did not incur an actual GFX trading loss in excess of the daily GFX VaR estimate.\nStrategic Risk\nStrategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable. The consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as reputational damage to the firm. Strategic risk encompasses two main areas:\n•\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical risk centers on external events or developments that would have a detrimental impact on financial markets and/or financial services firms. \n•\nBusiness risk arises from internal, secular, competitive, or regulatory trends that impact Northern Trust’s stated strategy or its achievability.\nStrategic Risk Framework and Governance\nThe Corporate Strategic Risk Framework has been developed in conjunction with the Corporation’s risk appetite and risk management policies, and defines the mission and expectations of the Strategic Risk Management function to identify and analyze the sources and consequences of strategic risk. \nThis is achieved through participation in the establishment and review of business line strategy, coordination of risk input to the evaluation of key strategic opportunities, and developing and maintaining a risk inventory and set of metrics which attempt to gauge the level of strategic risk within the organization. \nIn addition, the Strategic Risk Management function maintains the Global Event Response Program, which aims to anticipate and prepare for stress scenarios, and provide an outline for responding to them when they occur.\nBoth GERC and the Business Risk Committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and frameworks by which Northern Trust monitors and evaluates strategic risk.\n86\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nClimate Risk\nClimate risk continues to be an evolving strategic risk for the Corporation. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and is comprised of physical risk, liability risk and transition risk. Physical risk refers to risks to banks and the financial system emanating from the increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, droughts, floods, and fires). It can also refer to longer-term shifts in precipitation and temperature and increased variability in weather patterns (e.g., sea level rise). Liability risk stems from the potential for litigation in response to institutions’ and boards’ approach to the impacts of climate change. Transition risk reflects the risks to banks and financial systems of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy that may entail extensive policy, legal, technological, and market changes. Depending on the nature, speed, and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to banks and the financial system.  \nEffective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well-developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks. We continue to build out and enhance our climate risk management capabilities. Our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the Chief Climate and Sustainability Risk Officer who reports directly to the CRO. The Risk Management function has created a dedicated climate and sustainability risk unit to monitor, oversee and take account of the increasing impact that climate change has, or may in the future have, on financial risk, nonfinancial risk, and regulatory compliance across the globe. The climate and sustainability risk unit works to evolve the risk management framework to ensure the Corporation meets the expectations of all stakeholders as well as all climate-related commitments made by the Corporation to external agencies.\nThe Board of Directors, and in particular its Corporate Governance Committee, engages in active oversight of ESG matters of significance to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Business Risk Committee provides oversight of certain financial and operational risks associated with climate change and other environmental factors through its oversight of the Corporation’s global risk management framework and risk management policies. The Business Risk Committee also engages in periodic discussions with management and members of the Risk Management function regarding strategic risks, including climate-related risk.\nThe Corporation expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Corporation will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. Various regulatory agencies, investors, and other stakeholders have increased expectations and scrutiny in this area. Given the potential risks from climate change, the Corporation is committed to helping mitigate the impacts from its activities and to partner with key stakeholders to do the same.   \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n87\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report may include statements which constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Net Interest Margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.\nTABLE 45: RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n($ In Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet Interest Income\nInterest Income - GAAP\n$\n9,762.3\n \n$\n7,325.0 \n$\n2,877.7 \nAdd: FTE Adjustment\n31.8\n \n57.5 \n45.6 \nInterest Income (FTE) - Non-GAAP\n$\n9,794.1\n \n$\n7,382.5 \n$\n2,923.3 \nNet Interest Income - GAAP\n$\n2,177.1\n \n$\n1,982.0 \n$\n1,887.2 \nAdd: FTE Adjustment\n31.8\n \n57.5 \n45.6 \nNet Interest Income (FTE) - Non-GAAP\n$\n2,208.9\n \n$\n2,039.5 \n$\n1,932.8 \nNet Interest Margin - GAAP\n1.62\n \n%\n1.52 \n%\n1.36 \n%\nNet Interest Margin (FTE) - Non-GAAP\n1.64\n \n%\n1.56 \n%\n1.39 \n%\nTotal Revenue\nTotal Revenue - GAAP\n$\n8,290.4\n \n$\n6,773.5 \n$\n6,761.2 \nAdd: FTE Adjustment\n31.8\n \n57.5 \n45.6 \nTotal Revenue (FTE) - Non-GAAP\n$\n8,322.2\n \n$\n6,831.0 \n$\n6,806.8",
