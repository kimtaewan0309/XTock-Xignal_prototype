These services help customers protect their network investments, manage risk, and minimize downtime for systems running mission-critical applications.\nWe also offer a portfolio of professional services which includes planning, design, and implementation services, as well as high-value consulting services focused on aligning technology investments with business outcomes.  We continually invest in our support and professional services by integrating AI and automation, and expanding beyond core networking to cover the areas of security and analytics in line with our strategy. \nCustomers and Markets \nMany factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These include the size of the organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location, and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network. Our customer base is not limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. Our customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, public sector and service provider and cloud.\nEnterprise\nEnterprise includes businesses that are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices, or mid-market and small businesses. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. Our mid-market and small business customers typically require the latest advanced technologies, but with less complexity. We offer service and support packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily through our service provider partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as selling directly to these customers.\nPublic Sector\nPublic Sector includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector \n4\nTable of Contents\ncustomers through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as through direct sales.\nService Provider and Cloud\nService Provider and Cloud includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers and webscale providers, as well as Internet, cable, and wireless providers. We also include media, broadcast, and content providers within this customer market, as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional network-based, content-based and application-based services. This customer market offers data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses, governments, utilities, and consumers worldwide. Service provider and cloud businesses use a variety of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.\nSales Overview \nAs of the end of fiscal 2025, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 25,600 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell our products and services both directly and indirectly through a variety of channels with support from our sales workforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold indirectly through channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors.\nSystems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.\nDistributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other third-party resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.\nOur service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project, quality, and software maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers.\nFor information regarding risks related to our sales channels, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.”\nFor information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our operating results may be negatively impacted by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment;” “Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations;” “Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition;” “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows;” and “Cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents impacting our solutions and IT environment may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents on our customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, or in third-party products we use, could result in claims of liability against us, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business,” among others.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. We believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business, particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our financing arrangements include loans, leases (sales-type, direct financing and operating) and channel financing arrangements.\nAcquisitions, Investments, and Alliances\nThe markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire and invest in businesses and technologies that complement and enable further investment in our key priority areas.\n5\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions\nWe acquire companies in order to gain access to talent, technology, products and features, operational capabilities or new markets. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.”\nInvestments in Privately Held Companies\nWe make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide insights into emerging technologies that may become relevant to our businesses. The risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.”\nStrategic Alliances\nWe pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and accelerate new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or new market creation.\nThe risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.”\nCompetition\nWe compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority areas. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.\nOur competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.; Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Nvidia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Additionally, companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models. \nWe also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.\n \n6\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nWe regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We allocate our research and development budget among our product categories, which consist of Networking, Security, Collaboration, and Observability technologies. Our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time. Our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred.\nThe industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends, in part, on our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of Internet networking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect to continue to make acquisitions and strategic investments, where appropriate, to provide us with access to new technologies. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance.\nManufacturing\nWe rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary software in electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The manufacturing process also uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to International Organization for Standardization 9001 standards.\nOur arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-term contracts with any contract manufacturers. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis. These arrangements with contract manufacturers generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time.\nPatents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing\nWe seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. Further, some U.S. governmental entities and courts have expressed a position that U.S. copyright and patent protection should be limited to \n7\nTable of Contents\nprotecting inventions and works of authorship created by humans.  Therefore, U.S. copyright or patent protection for inventions or works developed in part or wholly by generative AI tools may be limited, or not available at all.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. \nThe risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,” “We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others,” and “We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.”\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous regulations and laws in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business. Many of these regulations and laws are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by courts and regulators, remain uncertain. These regulations and laws involve a variety of matters including privacy, data protection and personal information, cybersecurity, operational resilience, AI, tax, trade, encryption technology, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human rights, product certification, and national security.\nA failure, or alleged failure, by us to comply with regulations or laws could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information about government regulation and laws applicable to our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services” and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.”\nTalent and Culture\nAt Cisco, we value our people and our technology, and we leverage our broader ecosystems to positively impact the world and pursue our Purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All. Our goal is to attract, retain, and develop talent in order to help our customers connect and secure their infrastructure and accelerate their digital agility.

Our employees bring talent and ingenuity to everything we do, and in turn, we provide employees with meaningful careers and development opportunities.\nCisco is currently ranked #3 on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® 2025 in the United States. Fortune and Great Place to Work have published their United States rankings since 1998, and Cisco has been recognized on every annual list. In fiscal 2025, Cisco was recognized as a top three workplace in 14 countries by Great Place to Work, including #1 wins in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Ireland, Peru, and Singapore. \nAs of July 26, 2025, we had approximately 86,200 employees and they are categorized as follows:\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performance-based compensation aligned with each employee’s contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners, and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions. \n8\nTable of Contents\nHealth & Well-being\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We seek to provide our employees and their families with high-quality, flexible, and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. We strive to support our employees as they balance careers and personal lives, as well as their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other matters. \nWe offer mindfulness courses, employee assistance program offerings, and out-of-network provider benefits for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2025, we continued to offer employees “A Day for Me,” which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We employ a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations. \nEmployee Development\nCisco is advancing new approaches to leading, learning, and working in the age of AI. We invest in developing strategic capabilities that drive business growth, while enabling employees’ personal and professional development. By aligning skilling with our Guiding Principles and business priorities, we put learning at the center of innovation. \nRecognizing that each career is unique, we provide personalized learning opportunities in multiple formats that fit into employees’ daily work. We are also unifying our leadership development approach to offer a full range of programs for employees at all levels, reflecting our belief that you lead from every seat. The principle of “one company, many careers” guides us, and we are using data insights from skills intelligence to match people and opportunities. Learning and development are reinforced in our performance processes. Success at Cisco depends on both what is achieved and how it is achieved, with leaders supporting ongoing development through regular feedback and check-ins.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. These communications include the Cisco Beat, which are regular all-hands meetings, and Cisco Check-Ins, which are ad-hoc meetings for important conversations, and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a “Team Space Check-In.” In fiscal 2025, we have seen a high level of employee engagement. As an example, there were approximately 2 million Team Space Check-Ins by our employees in fiscal 2025, reflecting approximately 65,700 employees (excludes certain of the employees who joined Cisco during fiscal 2024 through the Splunk acquisition) submitting Team Space Check-Ins. Employees also participate in our global Engagement Pulse Survey and the Real Deal Survey.

Total revenue increased by 5% compared with fiscal 2024. Our results for fiscal 2025 include a full year of Splunk's results compared to approximately four months for fiscal 2024. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 6% and services revenue increased by 3%. In fiscal 2025, total software revenue was $22.3 billion, an increase of 21%, driven by the contribution of Splunk. Total subscription revenue increased 15%, driven by the contribution of Splunk. \nTotal gross margin increased by 0.2 percentage points. Product gross margin increased by 0.2 percentage points, driven by benefits from Splunk and productivity improvements, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing, a charge as a result of a legal dispute with a supplier, and the amortization of purchased intangible assets primarily related to Splunk. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 1.8 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.8 percentage points primarily due to increases in amortization of purchased intangible assets and share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2025, and a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 as a result of a legal dispute with a supplier. Diluted earnings per share was flat compared with fiscal 2024.\nIn terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased by $1.7 billion, EMEA revenue increased by $0.7 billion and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.5 billion. From a customer market perspective, product revenue growth was led by the enterprise market and the service provider and cloud market. The revenue increase in our service provider and cloud market was driven by AI infrastructure revenue from webscale customers. From a product category perspective, the product revenue increased 6% year over year, driven by a growth in revenue in Security of 59%, Observability of 26%, and Collaboration of 1%, partially offset by a decline in Networking of 3%. The product revenue growth in Security and Observability were each driven in large part by the contribution of Splunk.\nWe continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, and one that is complex especially with respect to tariffs and trade policy. We plan to continue to invest in key priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. We remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations and on accelerating innovation across our portfolio. We believe that we are making progress on our strategic priorities.\n31\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nFourth Quarter Snapshot\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased by 8%. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 10% and services revenue was flat. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in Americas increased by 9%, EMEA increased by 4% and APJC increased by 7%. From a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue growth in Networking, Security, Observability, and Collaboration\n.\n Total gross margin decreased by 1.2 percentage point\ns, driven primarily by a charge as a result of a legal dispute with a supplier. As\n a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 2.2 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.8 percentage points primarily driven by lower amortization of purchased intangible assets, lower restructuring and other charges, and a decrease in cash compensation expenses from acquisitions, partially offset by a charge as a result of a legal dispute with a supplier. Diluted earnings per share increased by 19%, primarily driven by the revenue increase and the increase in our operating margin percentage.\nStrategy and Priorities\nIn today's digital-first world, businesses and organizations globally are deploying technology to pursue their strategic objectives, from accelerating growth to enhancing operational efficiency and fostering innovation. Our strategy is to securely connect everything to make those desired outcomes possible.\nFor a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see “Item 1. Business.”\nOther Key Financial Measures\nThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024 (in millions): \nFiscal 2025\nFiscal 2024\nCash and cash equivalents and investments\n$16,110\n$17,854\nCash provided by operating activities\n$14,193\n$10,880\nRemaining performance obligations\n$43,533\n$41,048\nRepurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program\n$5,995\n$5,764\nDividends paid\n$6,437\n$6,384\nInventories\n$3,164\n$3,373\nTotal debt\n$28,093\n$30,962\n32\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\nRevenue Recognition \nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, resulting in contracts that may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. \nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers that we sell to directly. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers’ right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by customers under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. \nInventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\nInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nWe record a provision for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.  Both provisions are a component of cost of sales.\nOur total provisions for inventory and the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were $493 million, $819 million, and $730 million\n \nin fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements, then we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs, and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. For further discussion around the supply chain impacts and risks, see “—Results of Operations—Gross Margin—Supply Chain Impacts and Risks” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain” under Item 7 of this report.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. \nThird parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nValuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets \nGoodwill\nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2025, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $56.5 billion for the Americas, $80.1 billion for EMEA, and $32.9 billion for APJC. \nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. \nPurchased Intangible Assets\nThe accounting for acquisitions requires significant estimates and judgments in the valuation of purchased intangible assets. Critical estimates used in the valuation of purchased intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, useful lives and discount rates. While our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured \n34\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nby comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. \nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, and international realignments. Our effective tax rate was 8.3%, 15.6%, and 17.7% in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, and the related net interest and penalties.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. If we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and amortization, and corporate alternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The OECD, an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes, including a Pillar Two framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction, and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. \n35\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSubsequent to the issuance of our earnings release on August 13, 2025, we settled a legal dispute with a supplier, resulting in a GAAP charge to product cost of sales, which is described in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nProduct Revenue by Segment\nThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):\nYears Ended\n2025 vs. 2024\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nVariance in Dollars\nVariance in Percent\nProduct revenue:\n \n \n \n \n \nAmericas\n$\n24,637\n \n$\n23,142 \n$\n25,019 \n$\n1,495 \n6 \n%\nPercentage of product revenue\n59.2\n \n%\n59.0 \n%\n58.0 \n%\n \n \nEMEA\n11,122\n \n10,645 \n11,866 \n477 \n4 \n%\nPercentage of product revenue\n26.7\n \n%\n27.1 \n%\n27.5 \n%\n \n \nAPJC\n5,849\n \n5,466 \n6,257 \n383 \n7 \n%\nPercentage of product revenue\n14.1\n \n%\n13.9 \n%\n14.5 \n%\n \n \nTotal\n$\n41,608\n \n$\n39,253 \n$\n43,142 \n$\n2,355 \n6 \n%\nAmounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. \nAmericas\nProduct revenue in the Americas segment increased by 6%, with growth in the enterprise market and the service provider and cloud market. The growth in the service provider and cloud market was driven by AI infrastructure revenue from webscale customers. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the public sector market. From a country perspective, product revenue increased in the United States, Canada, and Brazil by 7%, 4%, and 8%, respectively.\nEMEA\nProduct revenue in the EMEA segment increased by 4%, driven by growth in the public sector and enterprise markets, partially offset by a slight decline in the service provider and cloud market. From a country perspective, product revenue increased in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France by 9%, 4%, and 6%, respectively.\nAPJC\nProduct revenue in the APJC segment increased by 7%,\n \nwith growth across each of our customer markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased in Japan, Australia, India, and China by 7%, 11%, 11%, and 10% respectively\n.\n37\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nProduct Revenue by Category\nIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to product categories and customer markets for various purposes.\nThe following table presents product revenue by category (in millions, except percentages):\nYears Ended\n2025 vs. 2024\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nVariance in Dollars\nVariance in Percent\nProduct revenue:\n \n \n \n \n \nNetworking\n$\n28,304\n \n$\n29,229 \n$\n34,570 \n$\n(925)\n(3)\n%\nSecurity\n8,094\n \n5,075 \n3,859 \n3,019 \n59 \n%\nCollaboration\n4,154\n \n4,113 \n4,052 \n41 \n1 \n%\nObservability\n1,055\n \n837 \n661 \n218 \n26 \n%\nTotal\n$\n41,608\n \n$\n39,253 \n$\n43,142 \n$\n2,355 \n6 \n%\nAmounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.\nNetworking\nThe Networking product category consists of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and servers. Revenue from the Networking product category decreased by 3%, or $0.9 billion. Revenue declined across the portfolio as a result of product shipments returning to normalized levels during the first half of fiscal 2025 from the elevated levels of product shipments we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2024. Within the portfolio, the revenue decline was primarily driven by servers. We also experienced a revenue decline in switching as a result of a decline in campus switching.\nSecurity\nThe Security product category consists of our Network Security, Identity and Access Management, SASE and Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Response offerings. Revenue in our Security product category increased by 59%, or $3.0 billion,\n \nprimarily driven by Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Response offerings, which includes the offerings from Splunk, and to a lesser extent, growth in our SASE and Network Security offerings. \nCollaboration\nThe Collaboration product category consists of our Webex Suite, Collaboration Devices, Contact Center and CPaaS offerings. Revenue in our Collaboration product category increased 1%, or $41 million, primarily driven by revenue growth in our Collaboration Devices, CPaaS and Contact Center offerings, partially offset by a decline in our Webex Suite offerings.\nObservability\nThe Observability product category consists of our network assurance, monitoring and analytics and observability suite offerings. Revenue in our Observability product category\n \nincreased by 26%, or $218 million,\n \nprimarily\n \ndriven by our Observability Suite offerings from Splunk and growth in our ThousandEyes network services offerings, partially offset by a decline in monitoring and analytics.\n38\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nServices Revenue by Segment\nThe following table presents the breakdown of services revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):\nYears Ended\n2025 vs. 2024\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nVariance in Dollars\nVariance in Percent\nServices revenue:\n \n \n \n \n \nAmericas\n$\n9,019\n \n$\n8,829 \n$\n8,427 \n$\n190 \n2 \n%\nPercentage of service revenue\n59.9\n \n%\n60.7 \n%\n60.8 \n%\nEMEA\n3,702\n \n3,472 \n3,269 \n230 \n7 \n%\nPercentage of service revenue\n24.6\n \n%\n23.9 \n%\n23.6 \n%\nAPJC\n2,325\n \n2,249 \n2,160 \n76 \n3 \n%\nPercentage of service revenue\n15.5\n \n%\n15.5 \n%\n15.6 \n%\nTotal\n$\n15,046\n \n$\n14,550 \n$\n13,856 \n$\n496 \n3 \n%\nAmounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.  \nServices revenue increased 3%, primarily driven by software, cloud and virtualization support from Splunk and product offering support services.\n \nServices revenue increased across each of our geographic segments.\nGross Margin\nThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages):\nAMOUNT\nPERCENTAGE\nYears Ended\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nGross margin:\nProduct\n$\n26,487\n \n$\n24,914 \n$\n26,552 \n63.7\n \n%\n63.5 \n%\n61.5 \n%\nServices\n10,303\n \n9,914 \n9,201 \n68.5\n \n%\n68.1 \n%\n66.4 \n%\nTotal\n$\n36,790\n \n$\n34,828 \n$\n35,753 \n64.9\n \n%\n64.7 \n%\n62.7 \n%\nProduct Gross Margin\nThe following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025:\nProduct Gross Margin Percentage\nFiscal 2024\n63.5 \n%\nProductivity \n(1)\n2.0 \n%\nProduct pricing\n(1.6)\n%\nMix of products sold\n1.1 \n%\nLegal dispute with supplier\n(0.8)\n%\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n(0.4)\n%\nOthers\n(0.1)\n%\nFiscal 2025\n63.7 \n%\n (1)\n \nProductivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provisions for inventory and the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.\nProduct gross margin increased by 0.2 percentage points primarily driven by benefits from Splunk and productivity improvements, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing, a charge as a result of a legal dispute with a supplier, and amortization of purchased intangible assets primarily related to Splunk. The productivity improvements were primarily driven \n39\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nby the effects of higher shipment volume and lower total provisions for inventory and the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers.\nSupply Chain Impacts and Risks \nIn past periods, we took multiple actions in order to mitigate component shortages and address significant supply constraints, which resulted in the need to secure long-term supply and increased our inventory supply chain balances compared to historical levels. In fiscal 2025, we entered into additional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers related to manufacturing Cisco Silicon One and other products to meet demand from webscale and other customers. We expect to continue entering into these additional purchase commitments in fiscal 2026. These actions and additional purchase commitments have in turn significantly increased our supply chain exposure, which has resulted in negative impacts to our product gross margin in recent periods and may result in further negative impacts in future periods. In addition, on August 26, 2025, we settled a legal dispute with a supplier relating to purchase obligations arising under long-term supply arrangements, which resulted in a charge to product cost of sales, which is described in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining and new supply chain exposures include potential material excess and obsolete or other charges if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are otherwise unable to mitigate these supply chain exposures. Additionally, while we are exposed to new and proposed tariffs and other trade policies, the extent of such exposure is uncertain but could be significant if the exposure remains and we are unable to mitigate it.\nServices Gross Margin\nOur services gross margin percentage increased by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to higher sales volume and lower delivery costs, partially offset by higher headcount-related costs.\nOur services gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.\nGross Margin by Segment\nThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages):\nAMOUNT\nPERCENTAGE\nYears Ended\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nGross margin:\nAmericas\n$\n22,962\n \n$\n21,372 \n$\n21,350 \n68.2\n \n%\n66.8 \n%\n63.8 \n%\nEMEA\n10,545\n \n9,755 \n10,016 \n71.1\n \n%\n69.1 \n%\n66.2 \n%\nAPJC\n5,431\n \n5,187 \n5,424 \n66.4\n \n%\n67.2 \n%\n64.4 \n%\nSegment total\n38,938\n \n36,312 \n36,788 \n68.7\n \n%\n67.5 \n%\n64.5 \n%\nUnallocated corporate items \n(1)\n(2,148)\n(1,484)\n(1,035)\nTotal\n$\n36,790\n \n$\n34,828 \n$\n35,753 \n64.9\n \n%\n64.7 \n%\n62.7 \n%\n \n(1) \nThe unallocated corporate items\n \ninclude the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements (which includes the supplier-related legal settlement as described in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. \nAmounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. \nThe Americas segment had a gross margin percentage increase driven by positive impacts from productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by pricing erosion. \nThe gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was primarily due to positive impacts from productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by pricing erosion.\nThe APJC segment had a\n \ngross margin percentage decrease driven primarily by pricing erosion and lower services gross margin, partially offset by positive impacts from productivity improvements and favorable product mix.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nResearch and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses\nR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):\nYears Ended\n2025 vs. 2024\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nVariance in Dollars\nVariance in Percent\nResearch and development\n$\n9,300\n \n$\n7,983 \n$\n7,551 \n$\n1,317 \n16 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n16.4\n \n%\n14.8 \n%\n13.2 \n%\nSales and marketing\n10,966\n \n10,364 \n9,880 \n602 \n6 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n19.4\n \n%\n19.3 \n%\n17.3 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n2,992\n \n2,813 \n2,478 \n179 \n6 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n5.3\n \n%\n5.2 \n%\n4.3 \n%\nTotal\n$\n23,258\n \n$\n21,160 \n$\n19,909 \n$\n2,098 \n10 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n41.1\n \n%\n39.3\n \n%\n34.9\n \n%\nR&D Expenses\nR&D expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses reflecting our investments in AI, share-based compensation expense, cash compensation expenses from acquisitions, and discretionary spending.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, cash compensation expenses from acquisitions, share-based compensation expense, and discretionary spending, partially offset by lower contracted services spending.\nG&A Expenses\nG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, share-based compensation expense, and  discretionary spending, partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and lower contracted services spending.\nEffect of Foreign Currency\nIn fiscal 2025, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $16 million, or 0.1%,\n \ncompared with fiscal 2024.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets including impairment charges (in millions):\nYears Ended\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets:\nCost of sales\n$\n1,174\n \n$\n955 \n$\n649 \nOperating expenses\n1,028\n \n698 \n282 \nTotal\n$\n2,202\n \n$\n1,653 \n$\n931 \nThe increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was primarily due to the acquisition of Splunk and other recent acquisitions, partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets that became fully amortized in larger part from our fiscal 2021 acquisition of Acacia, and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2025. Impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $40 million and $145 million for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. The impairment charges were a result of declines in estimated fair values resulting from the reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain in-process research and development and technology intangible assets.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nWe recognized total restructuring and other charges, which are included in operating expenses, of $744 million and $789 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n41\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we announced a restructuring plan in order to allow us to invest in key growth opportunities and drive more efficiencies in our business. This restructuring plan is expected to impact approximately 7% of our global workforce with estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $1 billion. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $744 million during fiscal 2025. We expect this plan to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2026.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. In connection with this plan, we incurred charges of $654 million for fiscal 2024 and the plan is complete.\nOperating Income\nThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):\nYears Ended\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nOperating income\n$\n11,760\n \n$\n12,181 \n$\n15,031 \nOperating income as a percentage of revenue\n20.8\n \n%\n22.6 \n%\n26.4 \n%\nOperating income decreased by 3%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 1.8 percentage points.

The net 7.3 percentage points decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a $720 million tax benefit related to the U.S. Tax Court opinion issued during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 regarding the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition year of the Tax Cut and Job Act (\"Tax Act\") (our fiscal 2018) and an increase in stock-based compensation windfall.\nFor a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments\n  The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions):\n   \nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nIncrease (Decrease)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n8,346\n \n$\n7,508 \n$\n838 \nAvailable-for-sale debt investments\n7,381\n \n9,865 \n(2,484)\nMarketable equity securities\n383\n \n481 \n(98)\nTotal\n$\n16,110\n \n$\n17,854 \n$\n(1,744)\nThe net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by cash returned to stockholders in the form of cash dividends of $6.4 billion and repurchases of common stock of $6.0 billion, net repayments of debt and short-term borrowing of $2.8 billion, and capital expenditures of $0.9 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of $14.2 billion. The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 benefited from lower tax payments.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.\nSecurities Lending\n  We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of July 26, 2025 and July 27, 2024, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation\n  As part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):\nYears Ended\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n14,193\n \n$\n10,880 \n$\n19,886 \nAcquisition of property and equipment\n(905)\n(670)\n(849)\nFree cash flow\n$\n13,288\n \n$\n10,210 \n$\n19,037 \nWe expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.\nWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We \n44\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nfurther regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. \nThe following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts):\nDIVIDENDS\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nTOTAL\nYears Ended\nPer Share\nAmount\nShares\nWeighted-Average Price per Share\nAmount\nAmount\nJuly 26, 2025\n$\n1.62\n \n$\n6,437\n \n105\n \n$\n56.53\n \n$\n5,995\n \n$\n12,432\n \nJuly 27, 2024\n$\n1.58 \n$\n6,384 \n117 \n$\n49.45 \n$\n5,764 \n$\n12,148 \nJuly 29, 2023\n1.54 \n6,302 \n88 \n48.49 \n$\n4,271 \n$\n10,573 \nOn August 13, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per common share to be paid on October 22, 2025, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 3, 2025. Future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. \nThe remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $14.2 billion, with no termination date. \nAccounts Receivable, Net\n  The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions):\n   \nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nIncrease (Decrease)\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n6,701\n \n$\n6,685 \n$\n16 \nOur accounts receivable net, as of July 26, 2025 was flat year over year as the increase in the amount of product and service billings was substantially offset by improved shipment linearity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nInventory Supply Chain\n  The following table summarizes our inventories and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions):\n   \nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nVariance vs. July 27, 2024\nVariance vs. July 29, 2023\nInventories\n$\n3,164\n \n$\n3,373 \n$\n3,644 \n$\n(209)\n$\n(480)\nInventory purchase commitments\n$\n7,599\n \n$\n5,158 \n$\n7,253 \n$\n2,441 \n$\n346 \nInventory deposits and prepayments\n$\n825\n \n$\n973 \n$\n1,109 \n$\n(148)\n$\n(284)\nThe following table summarizes our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers by period (in millions):\n   \nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nVariance vs. July 27, 2024\nVariance vs. July 29, 2023\nLess than 1 year\n$\n7,202\n \n$\n3,952 \n$\n5,270 \n$\n3,250 \n$\n1,932 \n1 to 3 years\n320\n \n1,085 \n1,783 \n(765)\n(1,463)\n3 to 5 years\n77\n \n121 \n200 \n(44)\n(123)\nTotal\n(1)\n$\n7,599\n \n$\n5,158 \n$\n7,253 \n$\n2,441 \n$\n346 \n (\n1) \nThe purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of July 26, 2025 has been reduced to give effect to the settlement of a legal dispute with a supplier over purchase obligations arising under certain long-term supply arrangements. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n45\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nInventory as of July 26, 2025 decreased by 6% and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 47% from our balances at the end of fiscal 2024. The combined increase of 26% in our inventory and inventory purchase commitments as compared with the end of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers related to manufacturing Cisco Silicon One and other products to meet the demand from webscale and other customers.  We expect our inventory balances may increase in future quarters as we work to fulfill this demand.\nIn addition, we have increased our levels of inventory in recent years in order to help mitigate risks in our supply chain, and began increasing our inventory supply chain balances starting in fiscal 2021 in order to address significant supply constraints seen industry-wide at the time. The increases were primarily due to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components and commitments with contract manufacturers to meet customer demand and to address extended lead times, as well as advance payments with suppliers to secure future supply, as a result of the supply constraints. Our risks of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses are further outlined in the Result of Operations—Product Gross Margin section.\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. \nOur inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments are entered into directly with suppliers and relate to fixed-dollar commitments to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.\nInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints, rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and inventory purchase commitments is appropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels.\nFinancing Receivables and Guarantees\n  The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions):\n   \nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nIncrease (Decrease)\nLoan receivables, net\n$\n5,591\n \n$\n5,808 \n$\n(217)\nLease receivables, net\n936\n \n906 \n30 \nTotal, net\n$\n6,527\n \n$\n6,714 \n$\n(187)\nFinancing Receivables\n  \nOur financing arrangements include loans and leases. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services (including technical support and advanced services), and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Lease receivables include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables decreased by 3% as compared with the end of fiscal 2024.\nFinancing Guarantees\n  \nIn the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. \nThe volume of channel partner financing was $24.9 billion, $27.1 billion, and $32.1 billion in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion as of July 26, 2025 and July 27, 2024, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner \n46\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nfinancing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 26, 2025, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $123 million, of which approximately $13 million was recorded as deferred revenue.\nBorrowings\nSenior Notes\n  \nThe following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions):\n \nMaturity Date\nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nSenior notes:\nFixed-rate notes:\n3.50%\nJune 15, 2025\n$\n—\n \n$\n500 \n4.90%\nFebruary 26, 2026\n1,000\n \n1,000 \n2.95%\nFebruary 28, 2026\n750\n \n750 \n2.50%\nSeptember 20, 2026\n1,500\n \n1,500 \n4.80%\nFebruary 26, 2027\n2,000\n \n2,000 \n4.55%\nFebruary 24, 2028\n1,000\n \n— \n4.85%\nFebruary 26, 2029\n2,500\n \n2,500 \n4.75%\nFebruary 24, 2030\n1,000\n \n— \n4.95%\nFebruary 26, 2031\n2,500\n \n2,500 \n4.95%\nFebruary 24, 2032\n1,000\n \n— \n5.05%\nFebruary 26, 2034\n2,500\n \n2,500 \n5.10%\nFebruary 24, 2035\n1,250\n \n— \n5.90%\nFebruary 15, 2039\n2,000\n \n2,000 \n5.50%\nJanuary 15, 2040\n2,000\n \n2,000 \n5.30%\nFebruary 26, 2054\n2,000\n \n2,000 \n5.50%\nFebruary 24, 2055\n750\n \n— \n5.35%\nFebruary 26, 2064\n1,000\n \n1,000 \nTotal\n$\n24,750\n \n$\n20,250 \nIn February 2025, we issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion.\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 26, 2025.\nCommercial Paper\n  We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $15.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $3.5 billion and $10.9 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 26, 2025, and July 27, 2024, respectively.\nCredit Facility\n  On February 2, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated 5-year $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement. The interest rate for the credit agreement is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio (defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense) of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. As of July 26, 2025, we were in compliance with all associated covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under our credit agreement.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRemaining Performance Obligations\n   The following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations (in millions):\n   \nJuly 26, 2025\nJuly 27, 2024\nIncrease (Decrease)\nProduct\n$\n21,572\n \n$\n20,055 \n$\n1,517 \nServices\n21,961\n \n20,993 \n968 \n    Total\n$\n43,533\n \n$\n41,048 \n$\n2,485 \nShort-term RPO\n$\n21,723\n \n$\n20,882 \n$\n841 \nLong-term RPO\n21,810\n \n20,166 \n1,644 \nTotal\n$\n43,533\n \n$\n41,048 \n$\n2,485 \nTotal remaining performance obligations increased 6% in fiscal 2025.

In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 26, 2025 (in millions):\n \nPAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD\nJuly 26, 2025\nTotal\nLess than 1 Year\n1 to 3 Years\n3 to 5 Years\nMore than 5 Years\nOperating leases\n$\n1,748 \n$\n429 \n$\n569 \n$\n381 \n$\n369 \nPurchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers\n7,599 \n7,202 \n320 \n77 \n— \nOther purchase obligations\n8,136 \n2,399 \n3,247 \n2,383 \n107 \nLong-term debt\n24,753 \n1,751 \n4,502 \n3,500 \n15,000 \nTransition tax payable\n1,595 \n1,595 \n— \n— \n— \nOther long-term liabilities\n1,745 \n— \n298 \n221 \n1,226 \nTotal by period\n$\n45,576 \n$\n13,376 \n$\n8,936 \n$\n6,562 \n$\n16,702 \nOther long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)\n2,240 \nTotal\n$\n47,816 \n48\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nOperating Leases\n  For more information on our operating leases, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\n  We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments are directly with suppliers and relate to fixed-dollar commitments to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. The purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of July 26, 2025 has been reduced to give effect to the settlement of a legal dispute with a supplier over purchase obligations arising under certain long-term supply arrangements. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” \nOther Purchase Obligations\n  Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.\nLong-Term Debt\n  The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTransition Tax Payable\n  Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Act.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\n  Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $2.2 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $75 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Commitments\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOf the total carrying value of our investments in privately held companies as of July 26, 2025, $0.8 billion of such investments are considered to be in variable interest entities which are unconsolidated. We have total funding commitments of $0.3 billion related to privately held investments. The carrying value of these investments and the additional funding commitments, collectively, represent our maximum exposure related to privately held investments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.  \n49\nTable of Contents",
