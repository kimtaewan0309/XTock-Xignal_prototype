Investing has grown in complexity, with more choices across asset classes, security types and geographies, and a wider array of risks and opportunities. In addition, the construction and management of investment portfolios are becoming increasingly outcome-oriented, rules-based and technology-driven. As a result, the investment process is transforming, which is reflected in several key trends:\n•\nChanging client strategies and operating models, influenced by fee compression, changing demographics, the regulatory environment and shifting economic outlooks;\n1\n Reflects the aggregation of all related client entities under their respective parent client entity. At acquisition, we align an acquired company’s client count to our methodology.\n2\nTable of Content\ns\n•\nUse of global, multi-asset-class and other complex strategies, including incorporating private asset and factor exposure objectives, as investors seek specific and unique outcomes;\n•\nThe need for high-quality data, insightful models and timely research, particularly during times of volatility and uncertainty;\n•\nIntegration of sustainability and climate considerations into investment processes, reporting and products;\n•\nGrowth of indexed investing through products such as ETFs, mutual funds, annuities and Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS funds”), as well as indexed derivatives such as futures, options, structured products and over-the-counter swaps;\n•\nAllocation of capital to private assets and desire for greater transparency into the drivers of private asset performance;\n•\nGrowing disclosure requirements that necessitate high-quality data and streamlined reporting solutions;\n•\nDemand for data and tools that support customized portfolio construction and specialized preferences and objectives; and \n•\nUse of advanced technologies, including AI, to enhance products, improve analytics, collect and evaluate data, improve client experiences, streamline operations and gain competitive advantages.\nWe believe the following competitive advantages position us well to meet client demands in light of these trends:\n•\nDifferentiated research-enhanced content \nprovides our clients with insights to better navigate a complex, fast-changing investment landscape. We are continually developing a wide range of differentiated content and have amassed an extensive database of global market data; proprietary index data; sustainability and climate data and metrics; factor models; private asset performance, transaction and benchmark data, including fund-and asset-level data; and risk algorithms, all of which can be critical to our clients’ investment processes. \n•\nClient-centricity \nallows us to build strong client relationships globally and better understand and service our clients’ needs. Our client coverage team develops and maintains strong and trusted relationships with senior executives and investment professionals.

Recent acquisitions include Fabric, a wealth technology platform for portfolio design and analytics, and Foxberry, a provider of index technology, which strengthen our wealth management and index customization capabilities, respectively. In 2024, we also entered into a strategic partnership with Moody’s Corporation to leverage our sustainability data and gain access to Moody’s private company database to extend our private company sustainability coverage. \nFinancial Model\nWe have an attractive financial model due to our recurring revenue and strong cash generation. Clients purchase our products and services primarily through recurring fixed and variable fee arrangements, which historically have delivered stable revenue and predictable cash flows.

For reporting purposes, the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions operating segments are combined and presented as All Other – Private Assets, as they did not meet the required thresholds for separate reportable segment disclosure. \nIndex\nClients use our indexes in many areas of the investment process, including for developing indexed financial products (\ne.g.\n, ETFs, mutual funds, annuities, futures, options, structured products, over-the-counter derivatives), performance benchmarking, portfolio construction and rebalancing, and asset allocation. They can access our index data directly from MSCI or through third-party vendors worldwide.\nOur index product offerings include:\n•\nMSCI Global Equity Indexes. \nMSCI Global Equity Indexes are designed to measure returns across a wide variety of equity markets, size segments, sectors and industries. As of December 31, 2024, we calculated indexes that covered more than 80 developed, emerging, frontier and standalone equity markets, as well as various regional indexes built from the component indexes.\n•\nESG and Climate Indexes.\n ESG and Climate Indexes are constructed from underlying MSCI indexes by applying additional data from our ESG and Climate segment to the eligibility, weighting or other index construction criteria.\n•\nFactor Indexes. \nFactor Indexes seek to reflect the performance characteristics of a range of investment styles and strategies, such as momentum or value.

In addition to single factor indexes, we offer multiple-factor indexes for investors with diversified multi-factor strategies.\n4\nTable of Content\ns\n•\nThematic Indexes.\n Thematic Indexes are designed to measure the performance of companies associated with shifts in macroeconomic, geopolitical and technological trends. These indexes can target areas of interest under megatrend categories such as the environment, healthcare and lifestyle.

Investors with unique index requirements can design an index to meet their specific needs and update the index design over time to support their evolving investment strategies.\n•\nFixed Income Indexes\n. Fixed Income Indexes include both investment grade and high-yield securities across a number of currencies that reflect the performance of credit markets generally, or specific investment strategies, including climate-focused or factor strategies.\n•\nReal Assets Indexes\n.

A majority of those revenues were attributable to annual, recurring subscriptions. A portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexed investment products. Such fees are primarily based on a client’s assets under management (“AUM”) or trading volumes and are referred to herein as asset-based fees. Since market movement and investment trends impact our asset-based fees, our revenues from asset-based fees are subject to volatility. For the year ended December 31, 2024, asset-based fees accounted for 41.2% of the total revenues for our Index segment.\nAnalytics\nOur Analytics segment offers risk management, performance attribution and portfolio management content, applications and services that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return and tools for analyzing market, credit, liquidity, counterparty and climate risk across all major asset classes, spanning short-, medium- and long-term time horizons.

In addition, our analytics capabilities are helping fuel growth in key areas across our business, such as our factor indexes and climate risk reporting solutions.\nOur clients can access our Analytics tools and content through our proprietary applications and APIs, third-party applications or directly through their own platforms. Our Analytics solutions provide clients with tools to construct and manage portfolios, including integrated market data from multiple third parties as well as content from MSCI’s other segments, which significantly reduces the operational burden on clients to independently source this information and populate it in our Analytics products.

This is often referred to as self-indexing.\nAnalytics. \nOur Analytics offerings compete with those from a range of competitors, including Axioma (part of SimCorp), BlackRock Solutions, Bloomberg, and FactSet Research Systems Inc.

We have registered “MSCI” and other marks as trademarks or service marks in the United States and in certain other countries. We will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks as appropriate. We have also at times filed patent applications to seek to protect our proprietary rights. Additionally, many of our offerings, processes and services require the use of intellectual property that we license for use from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our offerings and services. Our ownership and protection of intellectual property and other proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use third-party intellectual property are important to our business and contribute in part to our overall success. \nIn addition to our intellectual property, we rely on third-party data to create and deliver our products and services.

The LTIP is designed to align the interests of eligible employees with those of shareholders, enhance an “owner-operator” philosophy and retain key talent.\nSince January 2022, we have been operating according to a hybrid-work initiative called the Future of Work at MSCI. For most of our employees, the Future of Work allows employees to work at times at the office and other times remotely, depending on the requirements of a specific role and the needs of our clients. Our Future of Work model has helped to attract and retain talent and has contributed to employee engagement and satisfaction.\nCultivating Talent and Employee Engagement\nMSCI is committed to investing in employee learning and development. We offer tools and workshops to help employees grow their skills, receive feedback and coaching, deliver on their goals, and plan their careers. Our learning tools cover a wide range of topics, with options for self-paced and longer-term career development opportunities.\n4\n \nFor this purpose, “management roles” refers to employees in Managing Director, Executive Director or Vice President roles.\n10\nTable of Content\ns\nMSCI conducts an employee engagement survey at least annually that measures whether our approaches to performance, growth and career development are driving employee engagement.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion summarizing the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of MSCI for the year ended December 31, 2023 can be found in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2024.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of critical decision support tools and solutions for the global investment community. Our mission-critical offerings help investors navigate the complexities of a dynamic and evolving investment landscape. Leveraging our deep knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research, data and technology, we enable our clients to understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return and build portfolios more effectively. The Company has five operating segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions which\n are presented as the following three reportable segments: Index, Analytics, and ESG and Climate. For reporting purposes, the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions operating segments are combined and presented as All Other – Private Assets, as they did not meet the required thresholds for separate reportable segment disclosure.\nOur growth strategy includes: (a) extending leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes, (b) leading the enablement of sustainability and climate investment integration, (c) enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology, (d) expanding solutions that empower client customization, (e) strengthening client relationships and expanding our presence in key geographic areas and (f) executing strategic partnerships and acquisitions with complementary data, content and technology companies. For more information about our Company’s operations, see “\nItem 1: Business\n”.\nCurrent Trends Affecting MSCI\nTrends in Sustainability and Climate Investment Strategies\nWe believe sustainability and climate risks are investment risks that significantly impact many investment decisions, regulatory frameworks and corporate strategies. In Europe, disclosure requirements continue to drive demand for sustainability and climate tools to meet both regulatory and investor expectations. In the United States, political debate has led to some scrutiny of the use of sustainability and climate considerations in investment and risk management decisions.\nThe Company’s growth in this space depends on rising global demand for sustainability and climate solutions, which may be influenced by potential regulatory uncertainty or political opposition in certain markets. While some markets may face greater near-\n35\nTable of Content\ns\nterm challenges and uncertainty, we believe the long-term shift toward integrating financially material sustainability and climate factors into investment and risk management processes will support continued adoption of our sustainability and climate focused tools.\nAsset Management Industry Dynamics\nIn recent periods, the asset management industry—a key client segment for the Company—has undergone fee pressure and consolidation, driven by structural shifts, intensifying competition and evolving investor preferences. While industry fee pressure and consolidation may result in cost-cutting and vendor consolidation, firms may require more sophisticated and a broader array of investment tools across use cases and asset classes, driving demand for the Company’s offerings.\nThe impact of this fee pressure and consolidation remains uncertain, as client cost pressures could lead to contract adjustments or terminations, while asset managers may expand their use of the Company’s products and services, including for additional investment strategies. The extent to which these dynamics will impact the Company’s growth, client retention and revenue generation will depend on the pace of industry fee pressure and consolidation, evolving client priorities and the Company’s ability to adapt to shifting market demands.\nSee Item 1\n. Business—Industry Trends and Competitive Advantages\n and \n—Strategy\n, and Item 1A. \nRisk Factors—Client Risks\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of client trends and related risks.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics and Drivers\nIn evaluating our financial performance, we focus on revenue and profit growth, including results accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) as well as non-GAAP measures, for the Company as a whole and by segment.\nWe present revenues disaggregated by types and by segments, which represent our major product lines. We also review expenses by activity, which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed. In addition, we utilize operating metrics including Run Rate, Subscription Sales and Retention Rate to manage and assess performance and to provide deeper insights into the recurring portion of our business.\nIn the discussion that follows, we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period. While operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes asset-based fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the underlying AUM, which is the primary component of asset-based fees, is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately three-fifths of the AUM is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency-adjusted variances.\nRevenues\nOur revenues are presented by type and by segment. For each segment, we present revenues disaggregated by the nature of the revenues, which are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues.\nRecurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms. The fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance, prior to the license start date.\nAsset-based fees represent fees earned that are variable in nature, as they are primarily calculated based on the AUM linked to our indexes. Asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes, which are based on trading volumes and fee levels.\nNon-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we typically do not have renewal clauses within the contract. Examples of such products and services include one-time license fees, certain derivative financial products, certain implementation services, historical data sets and, occasionally, fees for unlicensed usage of our content in historical periods. Based on the nature of the services provided, non-recurring revenues are generally billed either in advance or after delivery and recognized point in time or over the service period.\nSee Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 3, “Revenue Recognition” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on revenue recognition.\n36\nTable of Content\ns\nOperating Expenses\nWe group our operating expenses into the following activity categories:\n•\nCost of revenues;\n•\nSelling and marketing;\n•\nResearch and development (“R&D”);\n•\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”);\n•\nAmortization of intangible assets; and\n•\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements.\nCosts are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or, when not directly attributable, an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved. Cost of revenues, selling and marketing, R&D and G&A all include both compensation as well as non-compensation related expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs, including data center, cloud service, platform and infrastructure costs; costs to acquire, produce and maintain market data information; costs of research to support and maintain existing products; costs of product management teams; costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs; as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources, finance and legal costs. \nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams, as well as costs incurred in other departments associated with acquiring new business, including product management, research, technology and sales operations.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhanced products and the costs to develop new or enhanced technologies and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development, research, product management, project management and the technology support directly associated with these activities.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations, human resources, office of the CEO, legal, corporate technology, corporate development, impairment charges associated with right of use assets and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed, but are instead allocated, to a product or service.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets expense relates to definite-lived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and capitalization of internally developed software projects. Intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships, proprietary data, trademarks and trade names and technology and software. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. See Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 9, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on intangible assets and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization of Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of computer and related equipment, leasehold improvements, software and furniture and fixtures over the estimated useful life of the assets.\n37\nTable of Content\ns\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness, including losses on early extinguishment of debt, income and losses associated with our previous equity method investment, foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, interest we collect on cash and short-term investments, as well as other non-operating income and expense items that may arise from time to time.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\n“Adjusted EBITDA,” a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs.\n“Adjusted EBITDA expenses,” a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs.\n“Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA expenses and Adjusted EBITDA margin are believed to be meaningful measures for management to assess the operating performance of the Company because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the Company’s ongoing operating performance in the period. All companies do not calculate adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA expenses in the same way. These measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. Accordingly, the Company’s computation of the Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies.\nOperating Metrics\nRun Rate\nRun Rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our Run Rate ultimately impacts our future operating revenues over time. At the end of any period, we generally have recurring subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months. We measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “Run Rate.” See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\nRun Rate\n” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.\nSubscription Sales\nSubscription Sales is a key operating metric and is important to management because new Subscription Sales increase our Run Rate and represent future operating revenues that will be recognized over time. See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\n Sales\n” below for additional information.\nRetention Rate\nRetention Rate is a key operating metric and is important to management because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\nRetention Rate\n” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant estimates and judgments made by management include such examples as assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and income \n38\nTable of Content\ns\ntaxes. We believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. \nGoodwill\nWe recognize goodwill in business combination transactions when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the acquired net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 or when interim triggers arise. When testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test; however, on a periodic basis, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. During the year ended December 31, 2024 we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. The test for impairment was performed at the reporting unit level, and we used an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. \nThe income approach requires significant judgement in estimating future cash flows, including assumptions, amongst others, about revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which reflects the reporting unit’s cost of capital. Forecasted future cash flows are estimated based on a combination of historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. Discount rates are selected for each reporting unit being valued based on each reporting unit’s estimated weighted-average cost of capital. The weighted-average cost of capital is estimated based on both the capital structure that we believe a market participant would utilize as well as the discount rates of guideline public companies that have similar characteristics to each reporting unit being valued, adjusted for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. Terminal growth rates are selected based on growth rates used during the reporting unit’s forecast period in combination with economic conditions. The market approach utilizes valuation multiples of revenue and cash flows derived from guideline public companies that have similar characteristics to each reporting unit being valued. Selecting appropriate guideline companies, valuation multiples and other key assumptions such as revenue growth rates and discount rates requires significant management judgment, and changes to these estimates could materially impact the fair value determination of each reporting unit. We perform sensitivity analyses around key assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the impact on the estimated fair value.\nImpairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value. As of July 1, 2024, all reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values. As a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded as of this date. \nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2024 on our Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units, which are also our operating segments. As of July 1, 2024, the fair value of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of goodwill within the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units were $689.8 and $617.8 million, respectively. As of July 1, 2024, the fair value of the Private Capital Solutions and Real Assets reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 10% and 30%, respectively, introducing risk of potential future impairments. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, the performance of one or more of our recently acquired companies or reporting units, or our common stock price, or if economic conditions differ significantly from management’s assumptions, our goodwill could be impaired in the future, which may be material to our results of operations and financial position.   \nFor all of our reporting units, individually, a hypothetical decrease in revenue growth rates by 100 basis points or a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in an impairment. See Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 9, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on goodwill.\nDefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances include adverse changes in the manner in which the asset will be used, adverse changes in legal factors related to the asset or negative changes in expected financial performance of the asset, including accumulation of costs and operating losses. Determining whether an event or changes in circumstances warrant an impairment review involves management judgment.\nOnce it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, determination of recoverability is determined based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. Measurement of impairment for intangible assets is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows used in the determination and calculation of impairments represent management forecasts and require significant management judgment. While management believes that its forecasts are reasonable, \n39\nTable of Content\ns\ndifferences between forecasts and actual experience could materially affect the valuations. There were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the years presented. \nWith respect to our acquisition of Burgiss on October 2, 2023, the valuation of intangible assets, as part of the acquisition method of accounting, was subjective and based, in part, on inputs that were unobservable. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included forecasted cash flows, which were determined based on certain assumptions that included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rates, technology obsolescence rates and discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Burgiss differently from the allocation that we have made.\nWe amortize our intangible assets over the estimated period of economic benefit. If the estimated period of economic benefit is changed, the prospective amortization of the intangible asset could materially change.\nSee Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 9, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on intangible assets and amortization expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. These laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business. The tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. \nProvision for income taxes is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to estimate future taxable income which requires judgment.\nWe must regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns and adjust unrecognized tax benefits when additional information is available or when an event occurs. This assessment requires significant judgment in assessment of tax laws, frequency of tax examinations, and the nature of intercompany transactions and tax positions.\nSee Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 12, “Income Taxes” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on income taxes.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Results\nAcquisitions of Burgiss, Trove, Fabric and Foxberry\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 66.4% interest in Burgiss for $696.8 million in cash. The Company’s existing 33.6% interest had a fair value at acquisition date of $353.2 million which resulted in a non-taxable gain of $143.0 million for the twelve months ending December 31, 2023.\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company’s ownership interest in Burgiss was classified as an equity-method investment. Therefore, All Other – Private Assets did not include the Company’s proportionate share of operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA related to Burgiss. The Company’s proportionate share of the income or loss from its equity-method investment in Burgiss was reported as a component of other (expense) income, net.\nFollowing the acquisition, the consolidated results of Burgiss are included in the Company’s Private Capital Solutions operating segment (formerly known as Burgiss), which is combined and presented as part of All Other – Private Assets. See Note 5, “Acquisitions,” and Note 13, “Segment Information” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on the acquisition of Burgiss.\nOn November 1, 2023 MSCI completed the acquisition of Trove Research Ltd (“Trove”), a carbon markets intelligence provider for approximately $37.9 million in cash. Trove is a part of the ESG and Climate operating segment.\n40\nTable of Content\ns\nOn January 2, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Fabric RQ, Inc. (“Fabric”), a wealth technology platform specializing in portfolio design, customization and analytics for wealth managers and advisors, for approximately $8.0 million in cash and contingent consideration that had an acquisition date fair value of $8.1 million that is payable based on future sales of Fabric’s products. Fabric is a part of the Analytics operating segment.\nOn April 16, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Foxberry Ltd. (“Foxberry”), a front-office index technology platform for approximately $23.5 million in cash and contingent consideration that had an acquisition date fair value of $19.1 million that is payable based upon the achievement of metrics related to the operation of the platform. Foxberry is a part of the Index operating segment. We collectively refer to the acquisitions of Burgiss, Trove, Fabric and Foxberry as the “recent acquisitions”.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are grouped by the following types: recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring. We also group operating revenues by major product as follows: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate and All Other – Private Assets.\nThe following table presents operating revenues by type for the years indicated:\nYears Ended\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nRecurring subscriptions\n$\n2,114,445 \n$\n1,871,290 \n13.0 \n%\nAsset-based fees\n657,501 \n557,502 \n17.9 \n%\nNon-recurring\n84,182 \n100,128 \n(15.9 \n%)\nTotal operating revenues\n$\n2,856,128 \n$\n2,528,920 \n12.9 \n%\nTotal operating revenues increased 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, total operating revenues would have increased 9.6%.\nOperating revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 13.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by growth in Index products, which increased $67.8 million, or 8.3%, growth in ESG and Climate products, which increased $36.5 million, or 12.9%, growth in Analytics products, which increased $55.3 million, or 9.2%, and growth in All Other - Private Assets products, which increased $83.6 million, or 48.9%. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, operating revenues from recurring subscriptions would have increased 8.5%.\nOperating revenues from asset-based fees increased 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024, mainly driven by growth in revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes. Operating revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes increased by 20.0% and 19.4%, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in average AUM. \nOperating revenues from non-recurring revenues decreased 15.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by one-time fees for unlicensed usage of our content in historical periods recognized in 2023.\n41\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table presents the value of AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and the sequential change of such assets as of the end of each of the periods indicated:\nPeriod Ended\n2023\n2024\n(in billions)\nMarch \n31,\nJune \n30,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\nMarch \n31,\nJune \n30,\nSeptember 30, \nDecember 31,\nAUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes\n(1) (2)\n$\n1,305.4 \n$\n1,372.5 \n$\n1,322.8 \n$\n1,468.9 \n$\n1,582.6 \n$\n1,631.9 \n$\n1,761.8 \n$\n1,724.7 \nSequential Change in Value\nMarket Appreciation/(Depreciation)\n$\n75.1 \n$\n48.4 \n$\n(56.1)\n$\n130.5 \n$\n92.8 \n$\n21.2 \n$\n111.3 \n$\n(85.3)\nCash Inflows/(Outflows)\n7.4 \n18.7 \n6.4 \n15.6 \n20.9 \n28.1 \n18.6 \n48.2 \nTotal Change\n$\n82.5 \n$\n67.1 \n$\n(49.7)\n$\n146.1 \n$\n113.7 \n$\n49.3 \n$\n129.9 \n$\n(37.1)\nThe following table presents the average value of AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes for the periods indicated:\nYear-to-Date Average\n2023\n2024\n(in billions)\nMarch\nJune\nSeptember\nDecember\nMarch\nJune\nSeptember\nDecember\nAUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes\n(1) (2)\n$\n1,287.5 \n$\n1,310.7 \n$\n1,332.6 \n$\n1,340.7 \n$\n1,508.8 \n$\n1,549.7 \n$\n1,592.1 \n$\n1,632.9 \n________________\n(1)\nThe historical values of the AUM in ETFs linked to our equity indexes as of the last day of the month and the monthly average balance can be found under the link “AUM in ETFs Linked to MSCI Equity Indexes” on our Investor Relations homepage at \nhttp://ir.msci.com\n.

In a scenario where operating revenue growth and profitability moderate, incentive compensation would be expected to decrease accordingly.\nFixed costs constitute a significant portion of the non-compensation component of operating expenses. The discretionary non-compensation component of operating expenses could, however, be reduced in the near-term in a scenario where operating revenue growth moderates.\nWe had 6,132 employees as of December 31, 2024 compared to 5,794 employees as of December 31, 2023, reflecting a 5.8% growth in the number of employees. Continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs. As of December 31, 2024, 69.1% of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 66.5% as of December 31, 2023.\nCompensation and benefits costs increased 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in wages and salaries, incentive compensation and benefits costs due to headcount growth, partially offset by increased capitalization of expenses related to internally developed software projects. Adjusting for the impact of recent acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, compensation and benefits costs would have increased by 5.7%.\nNon-compensation expenses increased 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by higher professional fees, information technology, market data costs, transaction and integration costs related to recent acquisitions. Adjusting for the impact of recent acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations non-compensation expenses would have increased by 5.8%.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets expense increased 43.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024, driven by higher amortization recognized on acquired intangible assets from recent acquisitions and higher amortization of internal use software.\n44\nTable of Content\ns\nDepreciation and Amortization of Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements decreased 19.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by lower depreciation on computers and related equipment.\nTotal Other Expense (Income), Net\nThe following table shows our other expense (income), net for the years indicated:\nYears Ended \n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nInterest income\n$\n(21,277)\n$\n(34,479)\n(38.3 \n%)\nInterest expense\n185,500 \n186,679 \n(0.6 \n%)\nGain on remeasurement of equity method investment\n— \n(143,029)\nn/m\nOther expense (income)\n8,127 \n6,377 \n27.4 \n%\nTotal other expense (income), net\n$\n172,350 \n$\n15,548 \nn/m\nn/m: percentage change is not meaningful\nThe change in total other expense (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the non-taxable one-time gain on the remeasurement of our equity method investment in Burgiss of $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, lower interest income, reflecting lower average cash balances as well as loss on extinguishment related to unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the prepayment of the Tranche A Term Loans (as defined below) and the entry into the Credit Agreement.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table shows our income tax provision and effective tax rate for the years indicated:\nYears Ended \n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n247,040 \n$\n220,469 \n12.1 \n%\nETR\n18.2 \n%\n16.1 \n%\n13.0 \n%\nThe effective tax rate of 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $21.4 million, which relates to $15.7 million of excess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation vested during the period and $5.7 million related to miscellaneous prior year adjustments.\nThe effective tax rate of 16.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects a benefit of $21.5 million from the non-taxable gain on Burgiss, partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability on the Company’s previous equity method investment in Burgiss.

For any Client Contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume/fees, the Run Rate calculation reflects, for ETFs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-ETF products, the most recent client-reported assets. Run Rate does not include fees associated with “one-time” and other non-recurring transactions. In addition, we add to Run Rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute Client Contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date. We remove from Run Rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any Client Contract when we (i) have received a notice of termination, non-renewal or an indication the client does not intend to continue their subscription during the period and (ii) have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such termination or non-renewal may not be effective until a later date.\nChanges in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in Run Rate. The actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from Run Rate for numerous reasons, including:\n•\nfluctuations in revenues associated with new recurring sales;\n•\nmodifications, cancellations and non-renewals of existing Client Contracts, subject to specified notice requirements;\n•\ndifferences between the recurring license start date and the date the Client Contract is executed due to, for example, contracts with onboarding periods or fee waiver periods;\n•\nfluctuations in asset-based fees, which may result from changes in certain investment products’ total expense ratios, market movements, including foreign currency exchange rates, or from investment inflows into and outflows from investment products linked to our indexes;\n•\nfluctuations in fees based on trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes;\n•\nprice changes or discounts;\n•\nrevenue recognition differences under U.S. GAAP, including those related to the timing of implementation and report deliveries for certain of our products and services;\n•\nfluctuations in the number of hedge funds for which we provide investment information and risk analysis to hedge fund investors;\n•\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n•\nthe impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\n50\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table presents Run Rates as of the dates indicated and the growth percentages over the years indicated:\nAs of\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nIndex:\nRecurring subscriptions\n$\n934,251 \n$\n861,366 \n8.5 \n%\nAsset-based fees\n678,599 \n590,872 \n14.8 \n%\nIndex total\n1,612,850 \n1,452,238 \n11.1 \n%\nAnalytics\n698,377 \n661,922 \n5.5 \n%\nESG and Climate\n343,741 \n319,324 \n7.6 \n%\nAll Other - Private Assets\n266,719 \n252,677 \n5.6 \n%\nTotal Run Rate\n$\n2,921,687 \n$\n2,686,161 \n8.8 \n%\nRecurring subscriptions total\n$\n2,243,088 \n$\n2,095,289 \n7.1 \n%\nAsset-based fees\n678,599 \n590,872 \n14.8 \n%\nTotal Run Rate\n$\n2,921,687 \n$\n2,686,161 \n8.8 \n%\nTotal Run Rate increased 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, driven by a 7.1% increase from recurring subscriptions and by a 14.8% increase from asset-based fees.

Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other - Private Assets Run Rate would have increased 6.8%.\nSales\nSales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from MSCI and will result in additional operating revenues. Non-recurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of Run Rate. New recurring subscription sales represent additional selling activities, such as new customer agreements, additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to Run Rate. Subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period, such as discontinuing products and services and/or reductions in price, resulting in reductions to Run Rate. Net new recurring subscription sales represent the amount of new recurring subscription sales net of subscription cancellations during the period, which reflects the net impact to Run Rate during the period. \nTotal gross sales represent the sum of new recurring subscription sales and non-recurring sales. Total net sales represent the total gross sales net of the impact from subscription cancellations. \n51\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table presents our recurring subscription sales, cancellations and non-recurring sales for the years indicated:\nYears Ended \n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nIndex\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n118,191 \n$\n116,016 \n1.9 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(45,730)\n(32,298)\n41.6 \n%\n  Net new recurring subscription sales\n$\n72,461 \n$\n83,718 \n(13.4 \n%)\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n62,840 \n$\n87,775 \n(28.4 \n%)\nTotal gross sales\n$\n181,031 \n$\n203,791 \n(11.2 \n%)\nTotal Index net sales\n$\n135,301 \n$\n171,493 \n(21.1 \n%)\nAnalytics\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n82,419 \n$\n79,035 \n4.3 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(39,106)\n(34,675)\n12.8 \n%\nNet new recurring subscription sales\n$\n43,313 \n$\n44,360 \n(2.4 \n%)\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n16,368 \n$\n14,379 \n13.8 \n%\nTotal gross sales\n$\n98,787 \n$\n93,414 \n5.8 \n%\nTotal Analytics net sales\n$\n59,681 \n$\n58,739 \n1.6 \n%\nESG and Climate\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n55,397 \n$\n55,092 \n0.6 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(22,989)\n(10,923)\n110.5 \n%\nNet new recurring subscription sales\n$\n32,408 \n$\n44,169 \n(26.6 \n%)\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n9,015 \n$\n5,625 \n60.3 \n%\nTotal gross sales\n$\n64,412 \n$\n60,717 \n6.1 \n%\nTotal ESG and Climate net sales\n$\n41,423 \n$\n49,794 \n(16.8 \n%)\nAll Other - Private Assets\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n40,758 \n$\n26,175 \n55.7 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(23,685)\n(15,337)\n54.4 \n%\nNet new recurring subscription sales\n$\n17,073 \n$\n10,838 \n57.5 \n%\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n3,878 \n$\n2,151 \n80.3 \n%\nTotal gross sales\n$\n44,636 \n$\n28,326 \n57.6 \n%\nTotal All Other - Private Assets net sales\n$\n20,951 \n$\n12,989 \n61.3 \n%\nConsolidated\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n296,765 \n$\n276,318 \n7.4 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(131,510)\n(93,233)\n41.1 \n%\nNet new recurring subscription sales\n$\n165,255 \n$\n183,085 \n(9.7 \n%)\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n92,101 \n$\n109,930 \n(16.2 \n%)\nTotal gross sales\n$\n388,866 \n$\n386,248 \n0.7 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n257,356 \n$\n293,015 \n(12.2 \n%)\n52\nTable of Content\ns\nRetention Rate\nThe following table presents our Retention Rate for the periods indicated:\nIndex\n(1)\nAnalytics\n(1)\nESG and Climate\nAll Other - Private Assets\nTotal\n2024\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n93.2%\n93.5%\n90.8%\n92.2%\n92.8%\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n95.2%\n95.8%\n94.3%\n91.2%\n94.8%\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n95.4%\n93.8%\n93.0%\n92.7%\n94.2%\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n95.0%\n93.3%\n93.1%\n86.4%\n93.1%\nYear Ended December 31,\n94.7%\n94.1%\n92.8%\n90.6%\n93.7%\n2023\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n96.4%\n94.0%\n96.1%\n92.1%\n95.2%\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n95.8%\n95.2%\n96.9%\n92.8%\n95.5%\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n96.2%\n95.1%\n96.0%\n91.3%\n95.4%\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n95.0%\n93.1%\n94.7%\n88.8%\n93.6%\nYear Ended December 31,\n95.8%\n94.4%\n95.9%\n90.4%\n94.7%\n______________________________\n(1)\nRetention rate for Index excluding the impact of the acquisition of Foxberry was 95.0% and 94.7% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. Retention rate for Analytics excluding the impact of the acquisition of Fabric was 93.3% and 94.1% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. \nRetention Rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. The annual Retention Rate represents the retained subscription Run Rate (subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year) as a percentage of the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year. \nThe Retention Rate for a non-annual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew or discontinue the subscription during the non-annual period, and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement, even though such termination or non-renewal may not be effective until a later date. This annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate. This cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100% to derive the annualized Retention Rate for the period.\nFor example, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded cancellations of \n$36.0 \nmillion. To derive the Retention Rate for the fourth quarter, we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of $36.0 million to derive $144.1 million of annualized cancellations. This $144.1 million was then divided by the $2,096.8 million subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the year, which is adjusted to include Fabric’s and Foxberry’s Run Rate as of the date of acquisition, to derive a cancellation rate of 6.9%. The 6.9% was then subtracted from 100.0% to derive a Retention Rate of 93.1% for the fourth quarter.\nRetention Rate is computed by segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. In general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our Retention Rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. In those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancel. In the Analytics and the ESG and Climate operating segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our Index and Real Assets operating segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances. In addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-sell of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. We do not calculate Retention Rate for that portion of our Run Rate attributable to assets in index-linked investment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, 27.4% of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter. In our product lines, Retention Rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year.\n53\nTable of Content\ns\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund ongoing operations, internal growth initiatives and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facility. In addition, we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets. We intend to use these sources of liquidity to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and dividend payments, and make repurchases of our common stock. In connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. We believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth.\nSenior Notes and Credit Agreement\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate of $4,200.0 million in Senior Notes outstanding. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, we had as of December 31, 2024 an aggregate of $336.9 million in outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our outstanding indebtedness and Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn January 26, 2024, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) amending and restating in its entirety the prior credit agreement dated as of June 9, 2022 (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement makes available an aggregate of $1,250.0 million of revolving loan commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility (“Revolving Loan Commitments”), which may be drawn until January 26, 2029. The Revolving Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement was drawn at closing in an amount sufficient to prepay all term loans outstanding under the term loan A facility (the “TLA Facility”) under the Prior Credit Agreement. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are general unsecured obligations of the Company.\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes (the “Indentures”) among us and Computershare, National Association, as trustee and successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, contain covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness. \nThe Credit Agreement also contains covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur certain indebtedness.\nThe Credit Agreement and the Indentures also contain customary events of default, including those relating to non-payment, breach of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-default and cross-acceleration, and bankruptcy and insolvency events, and, in the case of the Credit Agreement, invalidity or impairment of loan documentation, change of control and customary Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) defaults in addition to the foregoing. None of the restrictions detailed above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business.\nThe Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the Credit Agreement: (1) the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis not to exceed 4.25:1.00 (or 4.50:1.00 for four fiscal quarters following a material acquisition) and (2) the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis of at least 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2024, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was 2.34:1.00 and our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio was 10.16:1.00. \nUpon the closing of the Credit Agreement on January 26, 2024, the subsidiary guarantors were released from their guarantees under the Indentures and the Prior Credit Agreement. Previously, the Senior Notes and the Prior Credit Agreement were fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by our direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that accounted for more than 5% of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated assets, other than certain excluded subsidiaries. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, all of the Company’s subsidiaries were non-guarantor subsidiaries under the Indentures (‘non-guarantor subsidiaries”). The non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $2,249.1 million, or 78.7%, of our total revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2024, approximately $811.6 million, or 53.1%, of our consolidated operating income for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2024, and approximately $4,861.2 million, or 89.3%, of our consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets) and $1,532.8 million, or 24.0%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2024. \n54\nTable of Content\ns\nShare Repurchases\nIn 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock in the open market. See Note 11, “Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit),” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.\nAs of trade date February 6, 2025, a total of $1.4 billion of authorization remained available under the share repurchase program. This authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nCash Dividends\nOn September 17, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. On October 30, 2014, we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter.\nOn January 28, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.80 per share for the three months ending March 31, 2025. This reflects an increase of 12.5% over the quarterly cash dividend declared for the three months ended December 31, 2024. The first quarter 2025 dividend is payable on February 28, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on February 14, 2025.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, as of the dates indicated:\nAs of\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nCash and cash equivalents (includes restricted cash of $3,497 and \n   $3,878 at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively)\n$\n409,351 \n$\n461,693 \nThe following table presents the breakdown of the Company’s cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended \n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,501,627 \n$\n1,236,029 \nNet cash (used in) investing activities\n(144,255)\n(819,378)\nNet cash (used in) financing activities\n(1,402,308)\n(953,931)\nEffect of exchange rate changes\n(7,406)\n5,409 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(52,342)\n$\n(531,871)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately $225.0 million to $275.0 million for general operating purposes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $265.5 million and $285.2 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. Repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions. We believe the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purposes or other needs, including acquisitions or expansion of our products.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers, partially offset by higher cash expenses, mainly reflecting higher cash compensation.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation and benefits costs, income taxes, interest expense, information technology costs, professional fees, market data costs and office rent. Historically, the payment of \n55\nTable of Content\ns\ncash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nThe year-over-year change was primarily driven by the impact of lower cash paid for business acquisitions.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nThe year-over-year change was primarily driven by the impact of higher share repurchases and dividend payments.\nWe believe that global cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing revolving credit facility and our ability to access bank debt, private debt and the capital markets for additional funds, will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this Form 10-K and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In addition, we expect that foreign cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this Form 10-K and for the foreseeable future thereafter. \nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations consist primarily of our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the Senior Notes, Revolving Loan Commitments, leases for office space, leases for equipment and other operating leases and obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2024:\nYears Ending December 31,\n(in thousands)\nTotal\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nSenior Notes\n(1)\n$\n5,193,323 \n$\n155,875 \n$\n155,875 \n$\n155,875 \n$\n155,875 \n$\n1,155,875 \n$\n3,413,948 \nRevolving Loan Commitments\n(2)\n425,470 \n22,349 \n22,349 \n21,883 \n20,554 \n338,335 \n— \nOperating leases\n165,605 \n30,220 \n30,361 \n24,421 \n23,931 \n16,573 \n40,099 \nVendor obligations\n176,585 \n80,776 \n53,020 \n37,638 \n3,872 \n1,279 \n— \nOther obligations\n(3)\n9,959 \n9,959 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n5,970,942 \n$\n299,179 \n$\n261,605 \n$\n239,817 \n$\n204,232 \n$\n1,512,062 \n$\n3,454,047 \n______________________________\n(1)\nIncludes the impact of payments for the principal amount on the Senior Notes due 2029, the Senior Notes due 2030, the 3.875% Senior Notes due 2031, the 3.625% Senior Notes due 2031 and the Senior Notes due 2033 plus interest based on the 4.000%, 3.625%, 3.875%, 3.625% and 3.250% coupon interest rates, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes the impact of payments for the principal amount as well as coupon interest payments at the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2024 on the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2029.\n(3)\nPrimarily includes amounts payable related to an estimated one-time tax on deemed repatriation of historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the “Toll Charge”) imposed after Tax Reform was enacted. The Toll Charge, to the extent it is payable in more than one year, is included within “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nThe obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nSee Note 2, “Recent Accounting Standards Updates,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.\n56\nTable of Content\ns",
