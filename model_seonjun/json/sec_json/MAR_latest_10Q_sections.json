We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We make forward-looking statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this \n16\nTable of Contents\nreport based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information available to us through the date this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements include information related to our development pipeline; our expectations regarding rooms growth; our expectations regarding our ability to meet our liquidity requirements; our capital expenditures and other investment spending and reimbursement expectations; our expectations regarding future dividends and share repurchases; our expectations regarding certain claims, legal proceedings, settlements or resolutions; our expectations regarding additional payments to citizenM Holding BV and certain of its affiliates and the integration of the citizenM hotels into our system and platforms; and other statements that are preceded by, followed by, or include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “foresees,” or similar expressions; and similar statements concerning anticipated future events and expectations that are not historical facts.\nWe caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to numerous evolving risks and uncertainties that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including uncertainty resulting from economic, political or other global, national, and regional conditions and events, including related to tariffs, trade, travel and other policies; the risks and uncertainties we describe in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (“2024 Form 10-K”); Part II, Item 1A of this report; and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC.\nBUSINESS AND OVERVIEW\nOverview\nWe are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties under more than 30 brand names. We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: (1) U.S. & Canada, (2) Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EMEA”), (3) Greater China, and (4) Asia Pacific excluding China (“APEC”). Our Caribbean & Latin America (“CALA”) operating segment does not meet the applicable accounting criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment, and as such, we include its results in “Unallocated corporate and other.”\nUnder our asset-light business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels and other lodging offerings, rather than own them. Terms of our management agreements vary, but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. In many cases (particularly in our U.S. & Canada, Europe, and CALA regions), incentive management fees are subject to a specified owner return. Under our hotel franchising arrangements, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees, which are typically based on a percentage of room revenues, plus for certain brands, a percentage of food and beverage revenues. We also have license and other agreements with third parties for certain offerings, such as for our timeshare properties, MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, Design Hotels, and The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, under which we receive royalty fees and certain other fees. Additionally, we earn fees for other uses of our intellectual property, including primarily co-branded credit card fees, as well as residential branding fees and certain other licensing fees.\nPerformance\n \nMeasures\nWe believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing property level room revenue by total rooms available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues, and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing total rooms sold by total rooms available for the period, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property level room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. Unless otherwise stated, RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics are on a systemwide basis for comparable properties, and all changes refer to year-over-year changes for the comparable period. Comparisons to prior periods are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, which we calculate by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior \n17\nTable of Contents\ncomparable period. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding the performance of hotels in our system as it removes currency fluctuations from the presentation of such results.\nWe define our comparable properties as hotels in our system that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2024 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (1) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (2) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (3) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. Our comparable properties also exclude MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, Design Hotels, The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, residences, and timeshare properties.\nBusiness Trends\nIn the 2025 third quarter, worldwide RevPAR increased 0.5 percent, driven by ADR growth of 0.9 percent. In the 2025 first three quarters, worldwide RevPAR increased 2.0 percent, driven by ADR growth of 1.9 percent.\nIn the U.S. & Canada, RevPAR decreased 0.4 percent in the 2025 third quarter and increased 0.9 percent in the 2025 first three quarters, reflecting strong demand at our luxury hotels, offset by weaker business transient demand at our select service hotels largely driven by softness in government travel. The RevPAR decrease in the 2025 third quarter was also driven by weaker group demand.\nIn our International regions, RevPAR grew 2.6 percent in the 2025 third quarter and 4.6 percent in the 2025 first three quarters, reflecting higher demand in APEC, EMEA, and CALA. In Greater China, RevPAR was unchanged in the 2025 third quarter and decreased 0.6 percent in the 2025 first three quarters, reflecting soft macro-economic conditions.\nStarwood Data Security Incident\nOn November 30, 2018, we announced a data security incident involving \nunauthorized access to the Starwood \nreservations database (the “Data Security Incident”). We are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the Company from the Data Security Incident in excess of the expenses already recorded; however, we do not believe this incident will impact our long-term financial health. See Note 6 for additional information related to legal proceedings, investigations, and insurance recoveries related to the Data Security Incident.\nSystem Growth and Pipeline\nAt the end of the 2025 third quarter, our system had 9,721 properties (1,753,722 rooms), compared to 9,361 properties (1,706,331 rooms) at year-end 2024 and 9,068 properties (1,674,600 rooms) at the end of the 2024 third quarter. In the 2025 first three quarters, we added roughly 47,400 net rooms.\nAt the end of the 2025 third quarter, we had approximately 3,900 properties and over\n \n596,000 rooms in our development pipeline, which included nearly 36,000 rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. Our development pipeline included over 250,000 rooms, or 42 percent, that were under construction or in the process of converting to our system at the end of the 2025 third quarter. Over half of the rooms in our quarter-end development pipeline are located outside U.S. & Canada.\nWe currently expect full year 2025 net rooms growth to approach 5 percent, including the rooms associated with the citizenM brand acquisition discussed in Note 2, which are not reflected in the property and room count or development pipeline discussed above.\n18\nTable of Contents\nProperties and Rooms\nThe following table shows our properties and rooms by ownership type.\nProperties\nRooms\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nvs. September 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nvs. September 30, 2024\nManaged\n1,961 \n1,999 \n(38)\n(2)\n%\n565,482 \n572,731 \n(7,249)\n(1)\n%\nFranchised/Licensed/Other \n(1) \n7,569 \n6,888 \n681 \n10 \n%\n1,158,003 \n1,074,361 \n83,642 \n8 \n%\nOwned/Leased\n50 \n50 \n— \n— \n%\n14,206 \n13,108 \n1,098 \n8 \n%\nResidential\n141 \n131 \n10 \n8 \n%\n16,031 \n14,400 \n1,631 \n11 \n%\nTotal\n9,721 \n9,068 \n653 \n7 \n%\n1,753,722 \n1,674,600 \n79,122 \n5 \n%\n(1)\nIn addition to franchised, includes our timeshare properties, MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, Design Hotels, and The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection.\nLodging Statistics\nThe following tables present RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics for comparable properties.

Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses increased primarily due to the inclusion of results from the Sheraton Grand Chicago hotel, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of the prior year. General, administrative, and other expenses decreased primarily due to lower guarantee reserves.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur long-term financial objectives include maintaining diversified financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At the end of the 2025 third quarter, including the effect of interest rate swaps, our total long-term debt (current and noncurrent) had a weighted average interest rate of 4.6 percent, a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.6 years, and a ratio of fixed-rate to total long-term debt of 0.9 to 1.0.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur Credit Facility\nWe are party to a $4.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Facility”). Available borrowings under the Credit Facility support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs. U.S. dollar borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a spread based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. We classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings (which generally have short-term maturities of 45 days or less) as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on December 14, 2027.\nThe Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4.5 to 1.0. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and liquidity needs.\nWe monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs. We believe the Credit Facility, and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. \nCommercial Paper\nWe issue commercial paper in the U.S. Because we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and access to capital markets.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $694 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $269 million from year-end 2024, primarily due to long-term debt issuances, net of repayments ($2,479 million), net cash provided by operating activities ($2,383 million), and issuances of common stock for our employee stock purchase \n23\nTable of Contents\nplan ($92 million\n)\n, partially offset by share repurchases ($2,300 million), net commercial paper repayments ($960 million), dividends paid ($539 million), capital and technology expenditures ($432 million), the citizenM asset acquisition ($349 million), and financing outflows for employee stock-based compensation withholding taxes ($111 million).\nOur ratio of current assets to current liabilities was\n \n0.5 to 1.0 at the end of the 2025 third quarter. We have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.\nCapital Expenditures and Other Investments\nWe made capital and technology expenditures of $432 million in the 2025 first three quarters and $408 million in the 2024 first three quarters. We expect capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately $1,450 million for the 2025 full year, including capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. This estimate includes $349 million of investment spending related to the citizenM brand acquisition discussed in Note 2, but excludes any additional potential property or brand acquisitions, which we cannot forecast with sufficient accuracy and which may be significant. Our anticipated capital and technology expenditures include higher than typical spending on our worldwide technology systems transformation, the overwhelming portion of which we expect to be reimbursed over time, and renovations of hotels in our owned and leased portfolio.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nWe repurchased 3.0 million shares of our common stock for $0.8 billion in the 2025 third quarter. Year-to-date through October 30, 2025, we repurchased 9.7 million shares for $2.6 billion. For additional information, see “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 2.\nOur Board of Directors declared the following quarterly cash dividends in 2025 to date: (1) $0.63 per share declared on February 13, 2025 and paid on March 31, 2025 to stockholders of record on February 27, 2025; (2) $0.67 per share declared on May 9, 2025 and paid on June 30, 2025 to stockholders of record on May 23, 2025; and (3) $0.67 per share declared on August 7, 2025 and paid on September 30, 2025 to stockholders of record on August 21, 2025.\nWe expect to continue to return cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of the end of the 2025 third quarter, other than with respect to potential earn-out payments related to our purchase of the citizenM brand discussed in Note 2, there have been no material changes to our cash requirements as disclosed in our 2024 Form 10-K. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our 2024 Form 10-K for more information about our cash requirements.\n \nAlso, see Note 7 for information on our long-term debt.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We have discussed those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application in our 2024 Form 10-K. We have made no material changes to our critical accounting policies or the methodologies or assumptions that we apply under them."
