All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “goal”, “intend”, “objective”, “plan”, “projection”, “seek”, “strategy”, or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply, and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: federal, state, and local regulatory and political trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; possible increased federal, state, and local regulation of the safety of our operations; possible significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs; the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing, transporting, and storing natural gas; the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline, and/or storage services; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce; natural disasters, adverse weather, terrorist activities, or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control; failure of technology that affects the Company's business operations; the threat of cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee, or Company information; the impact of new cybersecurity compliance requirements; adverse weather conditions; the impact of legislation to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions or fossil fuels; the impact of climate change; the capital-intensive nature of our business; our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities, including commodity price volatility, counterparty performance or creditworthiness, and interest rate risk; the concentration of our operations in Texas; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; changes in the availability and price of natural gas; and increased costs of providing health care benefits, along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nOVERVIEW\nAtmos Energy and our subsidiaries are engaged in the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage businesses. We distribute natural gas through sales and transportation arrangements to over 3.3 million residential, commercial, public authority, and industrial customers throughout our six distribution divisions, which at June 30, 2025 covered service areas located in eight states. In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution and pipeline systems. \nWe manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments: \n•\nThe \ndistribution segment \nis comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. \n•\nThe \npipeline and storage segment\n is comprised primarily of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana.\n28\nOur vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Our commitment to this vision requires significant levels of capital spending to modernize our natural gas distribution system and operating costs to deliver natural gas safely and reliably and in full compliance with the various safety regulations impacting our business. We have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of our expenditures timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns. The execution of our capital spending program, the ability to recover these expenditures timely, and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance.\nWe anticipate making significant capital expenditures for the foreseeable future to modernize our distribution and transmission system, to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas in which we operate, and to prepare to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve. Between fiscal years 2025 and 2029, we anticipate spending approximately $24 billion, with more than 80 percent dedicated to safety and reliability spending. The magnitude and allocation of these expenditures may be affected by factors such as new policy and regulations, population growth, and increased labor and materials costs. Although we believe these costs are ultimately recoverable through our rates based on the regulatory frameworks currently available to us, full recovery is not assured.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, and the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Actual results may differ from such estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 and include the following:\n•\nRegulation\n•\nPension and other postretirement plans\nOur critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. There were no significant changes to these critical accounting policies during the nine months ended June 30, 2025.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we recorded net income of $1,023.9 million, or $6.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $908.9 million, or $6.00 per diluted share for the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe 13 percent year-over-year increase in net income largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending, partially offset by higher bad debt expense, depreciation and property tax expenses, and higher spending on certain operating expenses.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we implemented, or received approval to implement, ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of $321.8 million. Additionally, as of June 30, 2025, we had ratemaking efforts in progress seeking a total increase in annual operating income of $248.7 million.\nCapital expenditures for the nine months ended June 30, 2025 were $2,597.8 million. Approximately 86 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation systems, with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce lag to six months or less. \nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we completed approximately $1.7 billion of long-term debt and equity financing. As of June 30, 2025, our equity capitalization was 60.0 percent. As of June 30, 2025, we had approximately $5.5 billion in total liquidity, consisting of $709.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $1,684.4 million in funds available through equity forward sales agreements and $3,094.4 million in undrawn capacity under our credit facilities.\nThe following discusses the results of operations for each of our operating segments.\nDistribution Segment\nThe distribution segment is comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. The primary factors that impact the results of this segment are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, competitive factors in the energy industry, and economic conditions in our service areas.\n29\nOur ability to earn our authorized rates of return is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and, ultimately, separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. Under our current rate design, approximately 70 percent of our distribution segment revenues are earned through the first six months of the fiscal year. Additionally, we currently recover approximately 50 percent of our distribution segment revenue, excluding gas costs, through the base customer charge, which partially separates the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns.\nSeasonal weather patterns can also affect our distribution operations. However, the effect of weather that is above or below normal is substantially offset through weather normalization adjustments, known as WNA, which have been approved by state regulatory commissions for approximately 97 percent of our residential and commercial revenues in the following states for the following time periods:\nKansas, West Texas\nOctober — May\nTennessee\nOctober — April\nKentucky, Mississippi, Mid-Tex\nNovember — April\nLouisiana\nDecember — March\nVirginia\nJanuary — December\nOur distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Revenues in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. \nThe cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our operating income because these costs are recovered through our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. However, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense. This risk is currently mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 89 percent of our residential and commercial revenues. Additionally, higher gas costs may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities, resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources. \nThree Months Ended June 30, 2025 compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 \nFinancial and operational highlights for our distribution segment for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 are presented below.\n \nThree Months Ended June 30\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n \n(In thousands, unless otherwise noted)\nOperating revenues\n$\n767,132 \n$\n633,211 \n$\n133,921 \nPurchased gas cost\n255,883 \n179,510 \n76,373 \nOperating expenses\n415,783 \n370,579 \n45,204 \nOperating income\n95,466 \n83,122 \n12,344 \nOther non-operating income\n7,017 \n11,452 \n(4,435)\nInterest charges\n22,271 \n22,550 \n(279)\nIncome before income taxes\n80,212 \n72,024 \n8,188 \nIncome tax expense\n9,731 \n6,175 \n3,556 \nNet income\n$\n70,481 \n$\n65,849 \n$\n4,632 \nConsolidated distribution sales volumes — MMcf\n41,008 \n37,863 \n3,145 \nConsolidated distribution transportation volumes — MMcf\n34,346 \n34,562 \n(216)\nTotal consolidated distribution throughput — MMcf\n75,354 \n72,425 \n2,929 \nConsolidated distribution average cost of gas per Mcf sold\n$\n6.24 \n$\n4.74 \n$\n1.50 \n30\nOperating income for our distribution segment increased 14.9 percent.

Our ratemaking outcomes include the refund (return) of excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation and do not reflect the true economic benefit of the outcomes because they do not include the corresponding income tax benefit.  Excluding these amounts, our total rate outcomes for ratemaking activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2025 were $232.5 million.\nRate Action\nAnnual Increase in\nOperating Income\nEDIT Impact\nAnnual Increase in\nOperating Income Excluding EDIT\n \n(In thousands)\nAnnual formula rate mechanisms\n$\n180,214 \n$\n782 \n$\n180,996 \nRate case filings\n64,269 \n(12,827)\n51,442 \nOther rate activity\n111 \n— \n111 \n$\n244,594 \n$\n(12,045)\n$\n232,549 \n32\nThe following ratemaking efforts seeking $248.7 million in increased annual operating income were in progress as of June 30, 2025:\nDivision\nRate Action\nJurisdiction\nOperating Income Requested\n(In thousands)\nKentucky/Mid-States\nInfrastructure Mechanism\nVirginia\n$\n550 \nLouisiana\nFormula Rate Mechanism\nLouisiana \n(1)\n22,304 \nMid-Tex\nRate Case\nATM Cities \n(2)\n12,531 \nMid-Tex\nRate Case\nEnvirons \n(3)\n7,994 \nMid-Tex\nFormula Rate Mechanism\nMid-Tex Cities\n165,027 \nMississippi\nRate Case\nMississippi\n40,301 \n$\n248,707 \n(1)    The Company implemented the requested amount, subject to refund, with rates effective July 1, 2025, and anticipates receiving final commission approval during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n(2)    The Railroad Commission of Texas approved an increase in operating income of $4.4 million on June 17, 2025, with rates effective August 1, 2025.\n(3)    The Railroad Commission of Texas approved an increase in operating income of $2.3 million on June 17, 2025, with rates effective August 1, 2025.\nAnnual Formula Rate Mechanisms\nAs an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms. We currently have formula rate mechanisms in our Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee operations and in substantially all the service areas in our Texas divisions. Additionally, we have specific infrastructure programs in substantially all of our distribution divisions with tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior test-year period.

APT is an intrastate pipeline in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central, northern, and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Barnett Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast, and the Permian Basin of West Texas. APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third-party local distribution companies, industrial, and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers. Over 80 percent of this segment’s revenues are derived from these APT services. These revenues are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC). As part of its pipeline operations, APT owns and operates five underground storage facilities in Texas. \nOur natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage two asset management plans, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements.\nOur pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry, and economic conditions in our Texas and Louisiana service areas. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in Texas could influence the volumes of gas transported for shippers through our Texas pipeline system and rates for such transportation. \nThe results of APT are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers. Additionally, its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.\nAPT annually uses GRIP to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. On February 26, 2025, APT made a GRIP filing that covered changes in net property, plant and equipment investments from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 with a requested increase in operating income of $77.2 million.

Additionally, we have a $1.5 billion commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with $3.1 billion in total availability from third-party lenders. The commercial paper program and credit facilities provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the Company's desired capital structure. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis.\nWe have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to issue up to $8.0 billion in common stock and/or debt securities, which expires December 3, 2027. As of June 30, 2025, $5.8 billion of securities were available for issuance under this shelf registration statement.\nWe also have an at-the-market (ATM) equity sales program under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $1.7 billion (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into in connection with the ATM equity sales program), which expires December 3, 2027. As of June 30, 2025, $828.5 million of equity was available for issuance under our existing ATM equity sales program. Additionally, as of June 30, 2025, we had $1.7 billion in available proceeds from outstanding forward sale agreements. Additional details are summarized in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n37\nThe liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's working capital needs and capital expenditure program for the remainder of fiscal year 2025.

Operating cash flow increased $298.3 million primarily due to the positive effects of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2024.\nCash flows from investing activities\nOur capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs. Over the last three fiscal years, approximately 86 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system. \n38\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2025, cash used for investing activities was $2,593.7 million compared to $2,119.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. Capital spending in our distribution segment increased $230.7 million, primarily as a result of increased system modernization and customer growth spending. Capital spending in our pipeline and storage segment increased $237.9 million primarily due to increased spending for pipeline system safety and reliability in Texas.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2025, our financing activities provided $1,297.1 million of cash compared with $1,376.0 million of cash provided by financing activities in the prior-year period.\nIn the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we received approximately $1.7 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity. We completed a public offering of $650 million of 5.00% senior notes due December 2054, and received net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of $639.4 million. We also completed a public offering of $500 million of 5.20% senior notes due August 2035, and received net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses of $493.9 million. Additionally, during the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we settled 4,907,436 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of $568.6 million. The net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending and for other general corporate purposes. Cash dividends increased due to an 8.1 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding.\nIn the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we received approximately $2.0 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity. We completed a public offering of $500 million of 6.20% senior notes due November 2053 and $400 million of 5.90% senior notes due November 2033, and received net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of $889.4 million. We also completed a public offering of $325 million of 5.90% senior notes due November 2033, and received net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of $339.7 million. Additionally, during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we settled 6,401,469 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of $750.0 million. The net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending and for other general corporate purposes. Cash dividends increased due to an 8.8 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes our share issuances for the nine months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:\n \nNine Months Ended June 30\n \n2025\n2024\nShares issued:\nDirect Stock Purchase Plan\n37,069 \n46,927 \n1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n275,498 \n235,473 \nRetirement Savings Plan and Trust\n42,163 \n52,372 \nEquity Issuance\n4,907,436 \n6,401,469 \nTotal shares issued\n5,262,166 \n6,736,241 \nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including but not limited to, debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest, and pension liabilities. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strategy, the risks associated with our businesses, and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate.\nOur debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). On April 2, 2025, Moody's reaffirmed its short-term credit rating, downgraded our long-term credit rating to A2, and placed our ratings under stable outlook. Currently, our outlook and debt ratings, which are all considered investment grade, are as follows:\nS&P\n \nMoody’s\nSenior unsecured long-term debt\nA-\n  \nA2\nShort-term debt\nA-2\n  \nP-1\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\n39\nA significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings.\nA credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA for S&P and Aaa for Moody’s. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S&P and Baa3 for Moody’s. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nDebt Covenants\nWe were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of June 30, 2025. Our debt covenants are described in greater detail in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nExcept as noted in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there were no significant changes in our contractual obligations and commercial commitments during the nine months ended June 30, 2025.\nRisk Management Activities\nIn our distribution and pipeline and storage segments, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts, and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases.  Additionally, we manage interest rate risk by periodically entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings.\nThe following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our financial instruments for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:\n \nThree Months Ended June 30\nNine Months Ended June 30\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n \n(In thousands)\nFair value of contracts at beginning of period\n$\n122,648 \n$\n351,261 \n$\n88,651 \n$\n370,256 \nContracts realized/settled\n265 \n(131)\n(10,536)\n(34,234)\nFair value of new contracts\n3,528 \n1,880 \n3,485 \n2,265 \nOther changes in value\n5,885 \n22,233 \n50,726 \n36,956 \nFair value of contracts at end of period\n132,326 \n375,243 \n132,326 \n375,243 \nNetting of cash collateral\n— \n— \n— \n— \nCash collateral and fair value of contracts at period end\n$\n132,326 \n$\n375,243 \n$\n132,326 \n$\n375,243 \nThe fair value of our financial instruments at June 30, 2025 is presented below by time period and fair value source:\n \nFair Value of Contracts at June 30, 2025\nMaturity in Years\n \nSource of Fair Value\nLess\nThan 1\n1-3\n4-5\nGreater\nThan 5\nTotal\nFair\nValue\n \n(In thousands)\nPrices actively quoted\n$\n129,715 \n$\n2,611 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n132,326 \nPrices based on models and other valuation methods\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal Fair Value\n$\n129,715 \n$\n2,611 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n132,326 \nONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT\nOn July 4, 2025, U.S. legislation formally titled \"An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of H. Con. Res. 14” (“The Act”) and commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law. The Act, among other things, extended key provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and introduced targeted changes to the U.S. federal income tax regime. We do not anticipate the provisions of the Act will have a material impact on our results of operations.\n40\nOPERATING STATISTICS AND OTHER INFORMATION\nThe following tables present certain operating statistics for our distribution and pipeline and storage segments for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. \nDistribution Sales and Statistical Data\n \nThree Months Ended June 30\nNine Months Ended June 30\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nMETERS IN SERVICE, end of period\nResidential\n3,129,847 \n3,096,038 \n3,129,847 \n3,096,038 \nCommercial\n254,871 \n252,494 \n254,871 \n252,494 \nIndustrial\n1,462 \n1,491 \n1,462 \n1,491 \nPublic authority and other\n5,626 \n7,960 \n5,626 \n7,960 \nTotal meters\n3,391,806 \n3,357,983 \n3,391,806 \n3,357,983 \nINVENTORY STORAGE BALANCE — Bcf\n59.5 \n61.2 \n59.5 \n61.2 \nSALES VOLUMES — MMcf \n(1)\nGas sales volumes\nResidential\n17,333 \n14,940 \n143,248 \n140,953 \nCommercial\n16,781 \n15,299 \n87,188 \n84,459 \nIndustrial\n5,934 \n6,585 \n20,277 \n21,124 \nPublic authority and other\n960 \n1,039 \n5,372 \n5,580 \nTotal gas sales volumes\n41,008 \n37,863 \n256,085 \n252,116 \nTransportation volumes\n36,220 \n36,471 \n124,045 \n125,439 \nTotal throughput\n77,228 \n74,334 \n380,130 \n377,555 \nPipeline and Storage Operations Sales and Statistical Data\n \nThree Months Ended June 30\nNine Months Ended June 30\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nCUSTOMERS, end of period\nIndustrial\n91 \n94 \n91 \n94 \nOther\n201 \n194 \n201 \n194 \nTotal\n292 \n288 \n292 \n288 \nINVENTORY STORAGE BALANCE — Bcf\n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \nPIPELINE TRANSPORTATION VOLUMES — MMcf \n(1)\n216,416 \n193,766 \n678,457 \n622,747 \nNote to preceding tables:\n(1)\nSales and transportation volumes reflect segment operations, including intercompany sales and transportation amounts.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nRecent accounting developments, if any, and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n \n41"
