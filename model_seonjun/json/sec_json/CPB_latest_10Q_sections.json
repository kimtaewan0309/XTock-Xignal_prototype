Financial Statements,\" and our Form 10-K for the year ended July 28, 2024, including but not limited to \"Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" \nExecutive Summary\nUnless otherwise stated, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"company\" refer to The Campbell's Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.\nOn March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands, Inc. (Sovos Brands) for total purchase consideration of $2.899 billion. For additional information on the Sovos Brands acquisition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All references to the acquisition below refer to the Sovos Brands acquisition.\nOn August 26, 2024, we completed the sale of our Pop Secret popcorn business. On February 24, 2025, we completed the sale of our noosa yoghurt business. For additional information on the divestitures, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Trends\nOur industry continues to navigate global macroeconomic challenges, including tariffs and shifting global trade policies; changes in consumer purchasing and spending patterns; supply chain pressures; commodity cost volatility; labor market issues; and economic uncertainties amplified by increased regulatory activity. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and other countries have and are expected to result in retaliatory measures on U.S. goods, such as the 25% tariffs imposed by Canada on imports of certain U.S. goods, and increase costs. We are continuing to monitor the rapidly evolving tariff and global trade policies and are working with our suppliers to mitigate potential impacts on our business. The extent and duration of the tariffs and the resulting impact on general economic conditions and on our business are uncertain and depend on various factors, such as recent legal challenges to the U.S.'s imposition of tariffs, negotiations between the U.S. and affected countries, the responses of other countries or regions, exemptions that may be granted, availability and cost of alternative sources of supply and demand for our products in affected markets. \nIn addition, in light of recent actions by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and states, we anticipate continued legislative and regulatory developments with respect to food ingredients, labeling and packaging at the state and federal levels, along with related changes in consumer expectations and behavior. In April 2025, the FDA announced a series of actions aimed at phasing out all “petroleum-based synthetic dyes” from the nation’s food supply, and in May 2025, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission published a report discussing factors contributing to chronic childhood disease including diet, environmental exposure, lack of physical activity and healthcare. While the effects of all of these proposals remain uncertain at this time, we are continuing to monitor changes to laws and regulations that affect the food industry and evaluate their impact on our business and financial condition.\nThrough the third quarter, we experienced a moderate level of input cost inflation and other supply chain costs. We anticipate continued supply chain productivity and benefits from cost savings initiatives to mitigate inflationary pressures and expect such benefits to offset incremental costs in 2025, excluding potential impacts of tariffs. We expect consumer trends to continue to evolve and our volumes to improve over time; however, economic pressures, including the challenges of persistent inflation and impacts of tariffs, may continue to negatively impact our volumes throughout 2025. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nSummary of Results\nThis Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows. \n•\nNet sales increased 4% in the quarter to $2.475 billion primarily due to the benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands and favorable volume/mix, partially offset by the impact of divestitures and lower net price realization. The increase in volume/mix was partially related to the favorable timing of shipments this quarter.\n•\nGross profit, as a percent of sales, was 29.4% in 2025 compared to 30.9% in the prior-year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of cost inflation and other supply chain costs, mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges and unfavorable net price realization, partially offset by benefits from supply chain productivity improvements, the prior-year impact from a Sovos Brands acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory and favorable volume/mix. \n30 \n•\nEarnings per share were $.22 in 2025, compared to $.44 in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter included expenses of $.51 per share and the prior-year quarter included expenses of $.30 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below. \nNet Earnings attributable to The Campbell's Company \nThe following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:\n•\nWe implemented several cost savings initiatives in recent years.

Excluding the benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands and the impact from the divestiture of the noosa yoghurt business, sales increased primarily due to gains in U.S. soup, \nRao's\n pasta sauces and Canada, partially related to the favorable timing of shipments. Sales of \nRao's \npasta sauces increased due primarily to the timing of shipments related to the implementation of our \n33 \nexisting SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Sovos Brands. Favorable volume/mix was partially offset by lower net price realization. Sales of U.S. soup increased 7% primarily due to increases in condensed soups, broth and ready-to-serve soups. \nIn Snacks, sales decreased 8%. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of the Pop Secret popcorn business, sales decreased due to declines in \nGoldfish\n crackers, third-party partner brands and contract manufacturing, \nSnyder's of Hanover\n pretzels, \nLate July\n snacks and \nLance\n sandwich crackers. Sales were impacted by volume/mix declines and neutral net price realization.\nGross Profit\nGross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, decreased by $4 million in 2025 from 2024. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 29.4% in 2025 and 30.9% in 2024. \nThe 150 basis-point decrease in gross profit margin was due to the following factors:\nMargin Impact\nCost inflation, supply chain costs and other factors\n(1)\n(300)\nNet price realization\n(80)\nHigher costs associated with cost savings initiatives\n(20)\nProductivity improvements\n130\nImpact of acquisition\n(2)\n60\nVolume/mix\n(3)\n60\n(150)\n__________________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes an estimated positive margin impact of 60 basis points from the benefit of cost savings initiatives, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including a 90 basis-point negative impact from the change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges. \n(2)\nPrior year included a negative margin impact of 70 basis points from a Sovos Brands acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory. \n(3)\nIncludes the impact of operating leverage.\nMarketing and Selling Expenses\nMarketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 8.7% in 2025 and 2024. Marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in 2025 from 2024. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition (approximately 5 points).\nAdministrative Expenses\nAdministrative expenses as a percent of sales were 6.5% in 2025 compared to 8.8% in 2024. Administrative expenses decreased 22% in 2025 from 2024. The decrease was primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition in the prior year (approximately 19 points); increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 9 points) and lower costs associated with cost savings initiatives (approximately 2 points), partially offset by higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 5 points) and the impact of the acquisition (approximately 2 points).\nOther Expenses / (Income)\nOther expenses were $160 million in 2025 compared to \n$30 million in 2024\n. Other expenses in 2025 included an impairment charge related to the \nSnyder's of Hanover \ntrademark of $150 million and accelerated amortization expense of $6 million. Other expenses in 2024 included costs associated with the acquisition of $16 million and accelerated amortization expense of $6 million. \nOperating Earnings\nSegment operating earnings decreased 1% in 2025 from 2024.\n34 \nAn analysis of operating earnings by segment follows:\nThree Months Ended\n(Millions)\nApril 27, 2025\nApril 28, 2024\n% Change\nMeals & Beverages\n$\n248\n$\n229\n8\nSnacks\n145\n167\n(13)\n393\n396\n(1)\nCorporate income (expense)\n(226)\n(135)\nRestructuring charges\n(1)\n(6)\n(13)\nEarnings before interest and taxes\n$\n161\n$\n248\n__________________________________________\n(1)\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges.\nOperating earnings from Meals & Beverages increased 8%. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of Sovos Brands, partially offset by a decline in the base business.\nOperating earnings from Snacks decreased 13%.

The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the items impacting comparability, including nondeductible costs associated with the acquisition of Sovos Brands in the year-ago quarter and the timing of recognition of tax expense related to the impairment charge.\nNINE-MONTH DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \nSales\nAn analysis of net sales by reportable segment follows:\nNine Months Ended\n(Millions)\nApril 27, 2025\nApril 28, 2024\n% Change \nMeals & Beverages\n$\n4,848\n \n$\n4,058 \n19\nSnacks\n3,084\n \n3,285 \n(6)\n$\n7,932\n \n$\n7,343 \n8\n35 \nAn analysis of percent change of net sales by reportable segment follows:\nMeals & Beverages\nSnacks\n(2)\nTotal\n(2)\nVolume/mix\n3%\n(3)%\n—%\nNet price realization\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n(1)\nDivestitures\n(1)\n(3)\n(1)\nAcquisition\n19\n—\n11\n19%\n(6)%\n8%\n__________________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer coupon redemption programs.\n(2)\nSum of the individual amounts does not add due to rounding.\nIn Meals & Beverages, sales increased 19%, primarily due to a 19-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands.

Gross profit decreased primarily due to the impact of cost inflation and other supply chain costs, unfavorable volume/mix and unfavorable net price realization, partially offset by supply chain productivity improvements and benefits from cost savings initiatives. \nCorporate expense in 2025 included the following: \n•\n$176 million of impairment charges related to the \nSnyder's of Hanover\n, Allied brands and \nLate July\n trademarks;\n•\ncosts of $74 million related to costs savings and optimization initiatives;\n•\n$25 million loss on the sale of the Pop Secret popcorn business;\n•\n$20 million of accelerated amortization expense; \n•\n$6 million of certain litigation expenses, including expenses related to Plum; \n•\n$2 million postretirement actuarial loss; \n•\n$8 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges; and\n•\n$1 million of insurance recoveries related to a cybersecurity incident. \nCorporate expense in 2024 included the following: \n•\n$96 million of costs associated with the acquisition of Sovos Brands;\n•\ncosts of $68 million related to cost savings and optimization initiatives; \n•\n$20 million of accelerated amortization expense;\n•\n$3 million of Plum litigation expenses;\n•\n$3 million of costs associated with a cybersecurity incident; and\n•\n$5 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges.\n37 \nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $260 million in 2025 increased from $165 million in 2024 primarily due to higher levels of debt and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio. \nTaxes on Earnings\nThe effective tax rate was 25.3% in 2025 and 25.3% in 2024. The effective tax rate was comparable primarily due to $15 million of tax expense related to the sale of the noosa yoghurt business, offset by nondeductible costs associated with the acquisition of Sovos Brands in the prior year and excess tax benefits associated with the vesting of stock-based compensation awards in the current year.\nRestructuring Charges, Cost Savings Initiatives and Other Optimization Initiatives\nMulti-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance) Cost Transformation Program and Integration\nContinuing Operations\nBeginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. \nOver the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure.\nOn March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance.\nIn 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continued to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.\nA summary of the pre-tax charges recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows:\nApril 28, 2024\n(Millions, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nTotal Program\nRestructuring charges\n$\n(3)\n$\n1 \n$\n297 \nAdministrative expenses\n13 \n47 \n437 \nCost of products sold\n3 \n9 \n128 \nMarketing and selling expenses\n1 \n4 \n23 \nResearch and development expenses\n1 \n3 \n10 \nTotal pre-tax charges\n$\n15 \n$\n64 \n$\n895 \nAggregate after-tax impact\n$\n11 \n$\n48 \nPer share impact\n$\n.04 \n$\n.16 \nA summary of the pre-tax costs associated with these initiatives is as follows:\n(Millions)\nTotal Program\nSeverance pay and benefits\n$\n253 \nAsset impairment/accelerated depreciation\n134 \nImplementation costs and other related costs\n508 \nTotal\n$\n895 \nOf the aggregate $895 million pre-tax costs incurred, approximately $720 million were cash expenditures. \nSegment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges.

Certain phases that had not been fully implemented were incorporated into the 2025 cost savings initiatives described below. \nSovos Brands Integration Initiatives\nOn March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We identified opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands.\nIn the three-month period ended April 28, 2024, we recorded Restructuring charges of $16 million for severance pay and benefits related to initiatives to achieve the synergies. In 2024, we recorded Restructuring charges of $21 million for severance pay and benefits related to initiatives to achieve the synergies and generated pre-tax savings of $10 million. The charges incurred in 2024 were associated with the Meals & Beverages segment.\nIn 2025, the initiatives to achieve synergies were incorporated into the cost savings initiatives described below.\n2025 Cost Savings Initiatives\nOn September 10, 2024, we announced plans to implement cost savings initiatives beginning in 2025, including initiatives to further optimize our supply chain and manufacturing network, optimization of our information technology infrastructure and targeted cost management. We also identified additional opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. As mentioned above, we substantially completed our previous multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration. Certain initiatives from that program have been incorporated into our 2025 cost savings initiatives. Cost estimates for the 2025 initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.\nA summary of the pre-tax charges recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows:\nApril 27, 2025\n(Millions, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nRestructuring charges\n$\n6 \n$\n17 \nAdministrative expenses\n7 \n26 \nCost of products sold\n7 \n25 \nMarketing and selling expenses\n— \n2 \nResearch and development expenses\n1 \n3 \nTotal pre-tax charges\n$\n21 \n$\n73 \nAggregate after-tax impact\n$\n16 \n$\n56 \nPer share impact\n$\n.05 \n$\n.19 \nA summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the initiatives is as follows:\n(Millions)\nRecognized as of April 27, 2025\nSeverance pay and benefits\n$\n17 \nAsset impairment/accelerated depreciation\n23 \nImplementation costs and other related costs\n33 \nTotal\n$\n73 \nThe total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified to date are approximately $210 million, and we expect to incur substantially all of the costs through 2028. These estimates will be updated as the detailed plans are developed.\n39 \nWe expect the costs for the actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $25 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $55 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $130 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 70%; Snacks - approximately 9% and Corporate - approximately 21%.\nOf the aggregate $210 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately $150 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $215 million in capital expenditures, of which we invested $88 million as of April 27, 2025. The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our manufacturing network, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications and implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Sovos Brands.\nWe expect the initiatives, once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $250 million by the end of 2028. As of April 27, 2025, we have generated total program-to-date pre-tax savings of $110 million.\nSegment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with segments is as follows:\n \nApril 27, 2025\n(Millions)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMeals & Beverages\n$\n14 \n$\n51 \nSnacks\n5 \n10 \nCorporate\n2 \n12 \nTotal\n$\n21 \n$\n73 \nOther Optimization Initiatives\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we began implementation of an initiative to improve the effectiveness of our Snacks direct-store-delivery route-to-market network. Pursuant to this initiative we will purchase certain Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance routes where there are opportunities to unlock greater scale in select markets, combine them and sell the combined routes to independent contractor distributors. We expect to execute this program in a staggered rollout and to incur expenses of up to approximately $115 million through 2029. In the three- and nine-month periods ended April 27, 2025, we incurred $9 million and $17 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $1 million in Administrative expenses related to this initiative, respectively. In the three- and nine-month periods ended April 28, 2024, we incurred $5 million in Marketing and selling expenses related to this initiative. As of April 27, 2025, we have incurred $22 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $1 million in Administrative expenses related to this initiative.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.\nOperating Activities\nWe generated cash flows from operations of $872 million in 2025, compared to $897 million in 2024. The decline in 2025 was primarily due to changes in working capital.\nWe had negative working capital of $623 million as of April 27, 2025, and $1.386 billion as of July 28, 2024. Current assets were less than current liabilities, which included debt maturing in one year, due to a focus on lowering core working capital requirements. Total debt maturing within one year was $799 million as of April 27, 2025, and $1.423 billion as of July 28, 2024. \n40 \nAs part of our focus to lower core working capital requirements, we have worked with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 120 days. We also maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. We have not pledged assets as security or provided any guarantees in connection with these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Amounts outstanding under these programs, which are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were approximately $254 million at April 27, 2025 and $243 million at July 28, 2024.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures were $296 million in 2025 and $376 million in 2024. Capital expenditures in 2025 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business, network optimization for our Meals & Beverages business and enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $450 million in 2025. \nIn Snacks, we have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. From time to time, we purchase and sell routes, including certain routes under our optimization initiatives. The purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities.\nOn August 26, 2024, we sold our Pop Secret popcorn business for $70 million and on February 24, 2025, we sold the noosa yoghurt business for $188 million, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments.\nOn March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. Cash consideration was $2.857 billion. The acquisition was funded through the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement of $2 billion and cash on hand.\nFinancing Activities\nDividend payments were $343 million in 2025 and $334 million in 2024. The regular quarterly dividend paid on our capital stock was $.39 and $.37 per share in the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively. On February 26, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.39 per share payable on April 28, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 3, 2025. On May 13, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.39 per share payable on August 4, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 3, 2025. \nIn September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $500 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In September 2024, the Board authorized an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million (September 2024 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The September 2024 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2024 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. The September 2024 program replaced an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million that was approved by the Board in June 2021 and has been terminated. During the nine-month periods ended April 27, 2025 and April 28, 2024, we repurchased 1.247 million shares at a cost of $60 million and 1.08 million shares at a cost of $46 million, respectively, pursuant to our anti-dilutive share repurchase programs. As of April 27, 2025, approximately $200 million remained available under the September 2024 program and approximately $301 million remained available under the September 2021 program. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for additional information. \nOn October 10, 2023, we entered into the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement totaling up to $2 billion scheduled to mature on October 8, 2024. Loans under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type. The proceeds of the loans under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement could only be used in connection with the acquisition of Sovos Brands and the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. On March 12, 2024, we borrowed $2 billion under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement and used the proceeds in order to fund the acquisition of Sovos Brands, along with the fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.\nIn August 2023, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions. \n41 \nOn October 2, 2024, pursuant to the registration statement, we completed the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.15 billion, consisting of:\n•\n$800 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum, due March 23, 2035, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 23 and September 23 commencing March 23, 2025; and\n•\n$350 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per annum, due October 13, 2054, with interest payable semi-annually on each of April 13 and October 13 commencing April 13, 2025.\nThe notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. \nI\nn October 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay $200 million of the $400 million outstanding under our 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement (the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement) due November 15, 2025 and a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. In November 2024, we repaid the remaining $200 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement. In March 2025, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes along with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper to repay a $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in March 2025.\nOn March 19, 2024, pursuant to the registration statement, we issued senior unsecured notes of $2.5 billion, consisting of:\n•\n$400 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.30% per annum, due March 20, 2026, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 20 and September 20 commencing September 20, 2024;\n•\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.20% per annum, due March 19, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 19 and September 19 commencing September 19, 2024;\n•\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.20% per annum, due March 21, 2029, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 21 and September 21 commencing September 21, 2024; and\n•\n$1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.40% per annum, due March 21, 2034, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 21 and September 21 commencing September 21, 2024.\nThe notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay the $2 billion of outstanding borrowings under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement used to fund the Sovos Brands acquisition, including fees and expenses in connection therewith, and the remainder of the net proceeds to repay commercial paper.\nOn April 5, 2024, we repaid $100 million of the $500 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement due November 15, 2025.\nAs of April 27, 2025, we had $799 million of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $370 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of April 27, 2025, we issued $27 million of standby letters of credit. \nOn April 16, 2024, we entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement for an unsecured, senior revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in an aggregate principal amount equal to $1.85 billion with a maturity date of April 16, 2029 or such later date as extended pursuant to the terms set forth in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement remained unused at April 27, 2025, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. We may increase the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement commitments up to an additional $500 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Loans under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.25:1.00, and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.\nWe are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses \n42 \nduring the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 28, 2024 (2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K). The accounting policies we used in preparing these financial statements are substantially consistent with those we applied in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates or assumptions: trade and consumer promotion programs; the valuation of long-lived assets; pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. Our critical accounting estimates are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10‑K.\nValuation of long-lived assets\n — \nThe valuation of long-lived assets is an area that requires the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired.\nSecond Quarter Assessment\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on certain salty snacks and cookie trademarks within our Snacks segment, including \nTom’s\n,\n Jays\n,\n Kruncher’s\n,\n O-Ke-Doke\n,\n Stella D’oro \nand\n Archway\n,\n \ncollectively referred to as our \"Allied brands.\" In 2025, sales performance was below expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $15 million on the Allied brands trademarks, reducing the carrying value to $28 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the \nLate July \ntrademark within our Snacks segment. In 2025, sales performance was below expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $11 million on the trademark, reducing the carrying value to $47 million. \nThird Quarter Assessment\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the \nSnyder's of Hanover\n trademark within our Snacks segment. In 2025, sales and operating performance were below expectations. In the third quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $150 million on the trademark, reducing the carrying value to $470 million.\nThe impairment charges were recorded in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nAs of April 27, 2025, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $3.678 billion as detailed below:\n(Millions)\nRao's\n$\n1,470 \nSnyder's of Hanover\n470 \nLance\n350 \nKettle Brand\n318 \nPace\n292 \nPacific Foods\n280 \nCape Cod\n187\nVarious other Snacks\n(1)\n311 \nTotal\n$\n3,678 \n_____________________________________\n(1)\n Includes the \nLate July \nand Allied brands trademarks.\nThe $1.47 billion carrying value of the \nRao's \ntrademark associated with the Sovos Brands acquisition approximates fair value. Holding all other assumptions used in the acquisition valuation measurement constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce the fair value of this trademark and result in impairment charges of approximately:\n(Millions)\nRao's\n1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital\n$\n215 \n1% reduction in revenue growth\n$\n95 \n1% decrease in royalty rate\n$\n155 \nExcluding the carrying value of the \nRao's\n trademark, based on the 2024 annual impairment testing and interim assessments described above, indefinite-lived trademarks with approximately 10% or less of excess coverage of fair value over carrying value had an aggregate carrying value of $1.117 billion as of April 27, 2025, and included\n \nthe \nSnyder's of Hanover\n,\n Pace\n,\n \n43 \nPacific Foods, Late July \nand Allied brands trademarks.\nAlthough assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation, sensitivities to changes are provided below. Holding all other assumptions in our impairment assessments constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately:\n(Millions)\nSnyder's of Hanover\n(1)\nPace\n(2)\nPacific Foods\n(2)\nAllied brands\n(1)\nLate July\n(1)\n1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital\n$\n80 \n$\n10 \n$\n40 \n$\n5 \n$\n10 \n1% reduction in revenue growth\n$\n35 \n$\n— \n$\n15 \n$\n5 \n$\n5 \n1% decrease in royalty rate\n$\n60 \n$\n5 \n$\n45 \n$\n10 \n$\n25 \n____________________________________\n(1)\nBased on 2025 interim impairment testing.\n(2)\nBased on 2024 annual impairment testing.\nWhile the 1% changes in assumptions would not result in impairment charges on our other trademarks, some changes would reduce the excess coverage of fair value over carrying value to less than 10% for the \nCape Cod\n trademark.\nThe estimates of future cash flows used in impairment testing are made at a point in time, involve considerable management judgment, and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, assumed royalty rates, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions, including the potential impact of tariffs. If our assumptions change or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result. \nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Report contains \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
