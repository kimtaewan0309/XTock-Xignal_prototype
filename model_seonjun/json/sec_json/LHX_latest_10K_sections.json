For financial information regarding our domestic and international \noperations, including long-lived assets, see \nNote 14: Business Segments\n in the Notes.\nThe majority of our international marketing activities are conducted through subsidiaries that operate in the \nEurope, Middle East and Africa (“\nEMEA\n”) and Asia-Pacific (“\nAPAC\n”) regions and Canada. We also have established \ninternational marketing organizations and several regional sales offices\n.\nCompetitive Conditions and Trends in Market Demand\nWe operate in highly-competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances. Some of our competitors \nin each of our markets are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and \ndevelopment (“\nR&D\n”). We concentrate on the opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources, \noverall technological capabilities and objectives. We also collaborate with innovative partners, such as our strategic \npartnerships with \nPalantir \nTechnologies and Shield Capital to develop new capabilities to meet the demands of our \ncustomers. Such collaboration is required by modern market dynamics where competing in our markets requires the \nability to fuse hardware, software and \nartificial intelligence (“\nAI\n”)\n.\n \nPrincipal\n competitive factors are product and \nsystem quality and reliability; technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability to develop and \nimplement complex, integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; and cost-effectiveness. We frequently \n“partner” or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to time, \ncompetitors on other programs. \nWe compete domestically and internationally against large defense companies; \nprincipally BAE Systems, Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, \nRTX,\n \nThales and\n non-\ntraditional defense contractors.\n For further discussion of trends in market demand, see “Item 7. Management’s \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” \nof \nthis R\nep\nort. \n_____________________________________________________________________\n3\nBacklog\nCompany-wide total backlog was \n$34.2 billion\n and \n$32.7 billion\n at \nJanuary 3, 2025\n and \nDecember 29, 2023\n, \nrespectively\n. We expect to recognize approximately \n45%\n of the revenue associated with Company-wide total \nbacklog by the end of fiscal \n2025\n and approximately \n75%\n of the revenue associated with Company-wide total \nbacklog by the end of fiscal \n2026\n, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. See \nNote 1: Significant Accounting \nPolicies\n \nin the Notes for additional information regarding Company-wide total backlog. \nR&D\nWe conduct R&D activities\n \nusing our own funds (company-funded R&D) and under contractual arrangements \n(customer-funded R&D)\n.\n See \nNote 1: Significant Accounting Policies\n in the Notes for further information on company-\nfunded R&D.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own a large portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights \nand other intellectual property and we routinely apply for new patents, trademarks and copyrights. We also license \nintellectual property to and from third parties\n.\n With regard to certain patents, the U.S. Government has an \nirrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize others \nto use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent \nto our use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous trademarks used on or in connection \nwith our products are also considered to be valuable assets.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur company is subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the \ndevelopment, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and services, and it is our policy to comply with the \napplicable laws in each jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Regulations include, but are not limited to, those \nrelated to import and export controls, corruption, bribery, the protection of the environment, government \nprocurement, competition, product safety, workplace health and safety, employment, labor and data privacy. The \nfollowing describes significant regulations that may impact our businesses. For further discussion of risks relating to \ngovernment regulations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.\nGovernment Contracts. \nIn \nfiscal 2024\n, the percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to \nU.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly \nor through prime contractors, was \n76%\n and no other customer accounted for more than \n5%\n of our revenue. \nAdditional information regarding customers for each of our segments is provided under “Item 1. Business — \nDescription of Business Segments” of this Report. \nCost-type contracts. \nOur U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the reimbursement of \nallowable costs plus payment of a fee and fall into three basic types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide \nfor payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which \nprovide for payment of a fee that may increase or decrease, within specified limits, based on actual results \ncompared with contractual targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-\nplus award-fee contracts, which provide for payment of an award fee determined at the customer’s discretion based \non our performance against pre-established performance criteria. Under our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable \ncontracts, we are reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on contract \nprogress. Some costs ar\ne \npartially or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or regulation. Examples \ninclude certain merger and acquisition \ncosts\n, lobbying costs, charitable contributions, \ninterest expense, financing \ncosts\n and certain litigation defense costs.\nFixed-price contracts. \nOur U.S. Government fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts or fixed-\nprice incentive contracts. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform a specific \nscope of work or sell a specific product for a fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings or carry the \nburden of cost overruns. Under our U.S. Government fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the \nU.S. Government both savings accrued for performance at less than target cost as well as costs incurred in excess of \ntarget cost up to \na negotiated ceiling price,\n which is higher than the target cost, but carry the entire burden of costs \nexceeding the negotiated ceiling price. Under such incentive contracts, profit may also be adjusted up or down \ndepending on whether specified performance objectives are met. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price and \nfixed-price incentive contracts, we generally receive either milestone payments totaling \n100%\n of the contract price \nor monthly progress payments in amounts equaling \n80%\n of \ncosts incurred \nunder the contract. The remaining \namounts, including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and \ndeliverables under the contract. \n_____________________________________________________________________\n4\nOur production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts and development contracts are generally cost-\nreimbursable contracts, although we have some fixed-price development contracts. \nTime-and-material contracts \nare considered fixed-price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged. \nFor further discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 3. \nLegal Proceedings” and “Item 7. M\nanagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nOperations” \nof this Report.\n  \nEnvironmental.\n \nOur operations are subject to and affected by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and \nregulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have \nincurred and, \nbased on currently available \ninformation, we expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with existing and pending \nenvironmental laws and regulations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report and \nNote 1: Significant Accounting Policies\n and \nNote 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies\n in the Notes.\nMaterials, Suppliers and Seasonality\nBecause of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, \nwe use numerous sources for the wide array of materials, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, \nmetals and plastics needed for our operations and products. We depend on suppliers and subcontractors for a large \nnumber of components and subsystems. We also rely on a limited number of certified microelectronics component \nsuppliers for our products. We have experienced component shortages from vendors as a result of the global \npandemic, natural disasters, or the shifting regulatory landscape. These events or regulations may cause a spike in \ndemand for certain electronic components resulting in industry-wide supply chain disruptions. For further \ndiscussion of risks relating to subcontractors and suppliers, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.\nWe do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the \ndistribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of contract awards and the timing and \navailability of U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance.\nHuman Capital and Sustainability\nOur success depends on our skilled workforce. Attracting, developing, motivating and retaining highly-skilled \npeople, particularly those with technical, engineering and science backgrounds, \nand in many cases, security \nclearances,\n is critical to our ability to execute our strategic priorities. We use human capital measures to set goals \nand monitor performance in several areas, including health and safety and talent.\nAdditional information regarding our human capital strategy and sustainability goals are available in our \n2024\n \nSustainability Report which \nwe expect to be published in fiscal\n \n2025\n on our company website. Information on our \nwebsite, including our \n2024\n Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Report.  \nWorkforce Demographics.\n \nWe had approximately \n47,000\n employees at \nJanuary 3, 2025\n, including \napproximately \n18,000\n engineers and scientists. Of our total employees, \n89%\n \nwere\n located in the U.S. As of \nJanuary 3, 2025\n, approximately \n2,600\n, or \n6%\n, of our U.S. employees were covered by various collective bargaining \nagreements, which we expect will be renegotiated as they expire, as we historically have done without significant \ndisruption to operating activities.\nHealth and Safety. \nWe prioritize the safety of our employees through maintaining a proactive safety culture and \nimplementing programs designed to eliminate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. Throughout the year, we \nreview and monitor our performance closely to reduce Occupational Safety and Health Administration reportable \nincidents\n. \nTalent Strategy. \nWe are focused on ensuring we maintain a balanced talent portfolio. Attracting new \nperspectives, ideas and capabilities, recognizing and rewarding performance, offering professional development and \ncareer growth opportunities, and providing an engaging employee experience that retains talent are strategic \npriorities. We strive to attract employees in all stages of their careers. \nWe hired approximately \n4,500\n new employees in \nfiscal 2024\n. We offer competitive salaries and comprehensive \nbenefit packages, including health care, retirement planning and employer retirement contributions, educational \nassistance, child and elder back-up care, paid parental leave, and a discretionary paid time off program. \nSustainability\n.\n \nDuring \nfiscal 2024\n, \nwe updated our environmental sustainability goals: by 2030 we plan to \nreduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (“\nGHG\n”) emissions by 60%, water usage by 20%, solid waste by \n10% from 2021 levels and source 40% of our electricity from renewable sources. \n_____________________________________________________________________\n5\nAvailable Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919.

A discussion of \nfiscal 2023\n \ncompared to \nfiscal 2022\n can be found in \nPart II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition and Results of Operations\n included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended \nDecember 29, 2023\n (our “\nFiscal 2023 Form 10-K\n”)\n.\n This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, should be read in \nconjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our Consolidated Financial Statements and \naccompanying Notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. Except for the historical information contained herein, the \ndiscussions in this MD&A contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results \ncould differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences \ninclude, but are not limited to, those discussed in \nPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\n of this Report. For additional \ninformation, see  \nPart I. Item 1. Business\n - Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n of this \nReport\n.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are the Trusted Disruptor in the defense industry. \nWith customers’ mission-critical needs in mind, we deliver \nend-to-end technology solutions connecting the space, air, land, sea and cyber domains in the interest of global \nsecurity. We support government customers in more than\n \n100\n \ncountries, with our largest customers being various \ndepartments and agencies of the U.S. Government, their prime contractors and international allies. Our products and \n_____________________________________________________________________\n21\nservices have defense and civil government applications, as well as commercial applications.\n As of \nJanuary 3, 2025\n, \nwe had approximately \n47,000\n employees, including approximately \n18,000\n engineers and scientists\n.\nWe structure our operations primarily around the products, systems and services we sell and the markets we \nserve, and we report our\n financial results in four business segments\n: SAS, IMS, CS and AR. See \nNote 14: Business \nSegments\n in the Notes for further information regarding our business segments\n. \nU.S. and International Budget Environment\nThe\n percentage of \nour\n revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign \nmilitary sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was \n76%\n, \n76%\n \nand \n74%\n, in \nfiscal 2024\n, \n2023\n and \n2022\n, respectively.\nOn March 9, 2024, the President signed the first tranche of \nGFY\n 2024 appropriations funding bills into law, \nwhich funded six government agencies, including\n \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration, through the remainder of \nGFY\n \n2024 which ended on September 30, 2024. A second funding bill, signed into law on March 23, 2024, funded all \nremaining agencies, including the \nDoD\n, through the remainder of \nGFY\n 2024. The bill \nprovided\n approximately \n$844 billion\n in funding for \nDoD\n. This was in line with our expectations for 3% growth for defense over \nGFY\n 2023 \nlevels and in line with the first year of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (“\nFRA\n”) caps. \nOn March 11, 2024, the President’s Budget Request for \nGFY\n 2025 was released. The \nDoD\n requested \n$850 billion\n, a 1% topline increase consistent with the \nFRA\n caps. \nOn April 24, 2024, the President signed into law a supplemental \nGFY\n 2024 appropriations package that included \n$67 billion\n in funding for key \nDoD\n programs, bringing the \nDoD\n funding for \nGFY\n 2024 to \n$911 billion\n.\nCongress has not yet reached a final agreement on \nGFY\n 2025 funding. A short-term \nCR\n was enacted on \nDecember 21, 2024 that will fund the U.S. Government until March 14, 2025. While operating under a \nCR\n, \ngovernment agencies are allocated a portion of \nGFY\n 2024 enacted funds, and \nDoD\n is prohibited from starting new \nprograms. If Congress does not enact all 12 \nGFY\n 2025 appropriations bills by April 30, 2025, a 1% automatic \nsequestration cut will go into effect as mandated by the \nFRA\n.\nFurther complicating the budget outlook is the need to raise the debt ceiling in 2025. Congressional inaction \nmay lead to a default and potentially create economic instability.\nThe overall defense spending environment, both in the U.S. and internationally, reflects the continued impacts of \nglobal conflicts and geopolitical tensions, and changes to U.S. Government or international spending priorities\n have \nand could in the future impact our business\n.\nFor a discussion of U.S. Government funding risks and international business risks see “Item 1. Business - \nInternational Business,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.\nEconomic Environment \nThe macroeconomic environment continues to present challenges, which \nhave\n impacted our business and may \ncontinue to impact our future results.\n \nThe ongoing uncertainty relates to the impacts of inflation, interest rates and \nongoing federal deficits\n, which could raise the cost of borrowing for the federal government impacting U.S. \nGovernment spending priorities and the demand for our products. \nFor a discussion of inflation-related risks, see \n“Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.\nOperating\n Environment, Strategic Priorities and Key Performance Measures \nAs a proven alternative to traditional primes and new entrants, our flexible business model allows us to operate \nas either a prime, merchant supplier, or subcontractor, offering both commercial pricing and traditional government \nacquisition approaches. Our products are used across many customer platforms and this platform-agnostic \napproach gives us a unique advantage in rapidly adapting to the changing threat environment while effectively \npartnering with new entrants and non-traditional contractors. Customer demand for our solutions remains robust, \nand we ended \nfiscal 2024\n with backlog of \n$34.2 billion\n, a \n5%\n increase over the prior year. Also in \nfiscal 2024\n, we \ninveste\nd \n$515 million\n (\n2%\n of total revenue) in company-funded R&D focused on technologies that expand our \ncapabilities across our domains.\nIn \nfiscal 2024\n, we made considerable progress with our LHX NeXt initiative, our targeted three-year program \ndesigned to enhance organizational agility and performance by leveraging our scale and relationships across \nsegments, driving operational efficiency and competitiveness for the enterprise. With this program we are investing \nin enterprise tools and optimized, revamped processes to unlock further opportunities for margin expansion and \ncreate additional value for our shareholders. \n_____________________________________________________________________\n22\nOur strategic priorities continue to be p\nerformance, growth and innovation\n. We plan to continue to invest, \nconsistent with profitable growth opportunities, and sustain our culture of innovation, while delivering on our \ncommitments to investors, our customers and on every contract we are awarded.  We intend to accomplish this by: \n•\nBuilding upon our solid foundation and operational rigor to execute for our customers;\n•\nFocusing on profitable growth while securing strategic positions as a prime \nor\n subcontractor; and\n•\nLeveraging innovation as a competitive advantage to develop rapid solutions.\nWe use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business, which are discussed in detail \nbelow in the “Operations Review” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this MD&A: \n•\nRevenue;\n•\nOperating income and margin; and\n•\nNet cash provided by operating activities.\nWe use these measures, along with other performance measures that are not defined by U.S. Generally \nAccepted Accounting Principles (“\nGAAP\n”), to assess the success of our business and our ability to create \nshareholder value. We believe these measures are balanced among long-term and short-term performance, growth \nand innovation. We also use some of these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes.\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n \nFiscal Year Ended\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nJanuary 3, 2025\nDecember 29, 2023\n \nRevenue\nProducts\n$\n15,134\n$\n13,694\nServices\n6,191\n5,725\nTotal revenue\n21,325\n19,419\nCost of revenue\nProducts\n(11,019)\n(9,711)\nServices\n(4,782)\n(4,595)\nCost of revenue\n(15,801)\n(14,306)\nGross margin\n5,524\n5,113\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(3,568)\n(3,313)\nImpairment of goodwill and other assets\n(38)\n(374)\nOperating income\n1,918\n1,426\nNon-service FAS pension income and other, net\n(1)\n354\n338\nInterest expense, net\n(675)\n(543)\nIncome before income taxes\n1,597\n1,221\nIncome taxes\n(85)\n(23)\nEffective Tax Rate\n5.3\n%\n1.9\n%\nNet income\n1,512\n1,198\nNoncontrolling interests, net of income taxes\n(10)\n29\nNet income attributable to L3Harris Technologies, Inc.\n$\n1,502\n$\n1,227\nDiluted \nEPS\n(2)\n$\n7.87\n$\n6.44\n______________\n(1)\n“FAS” is defined as Financial Accounting Standards.\n(2)\n“\nEPS\n” is defined as Earnings Per Share.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n23\nRevenue\n.\n \nAs described in more detail in \nNote 13: Acquisitions and Divestitures\n and elsewhere in the Notes, \nduring \nfiscal 2024\n and \n2023\n, we completed certain business divestitures.

Additionally, we \nclosed the issuance and sale of \n$3.25 billion\n aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate \ndebt \nconsisting of the 5.4% \n2027 Notes, the 5.4% 2033 Notes and the 5.6% 2053 Notes (collectively, the “\nAJRD Notes\n”).\n The AJRD Notes were \nused to fund a portion of the purchase price for the AJRD acquisition, and to pay related fees and expenses. \nWe repaid the entire outstanding \n$800 million\n aggregate principal amount of our 3.85% notes, due June 2023 \n(“\n3.85% 2023 Notes\n”) through \ncash\n. \nCP program.\n \nDuring\n \nfiscal 2024\n, we had a maximum outstanding balance of \n$2,799 million\n and a daily average \noutstanding balance of \n$2,100 million\n under our \nCP Program\n.\n \nWe expect balances under the \nCP Program\n to remain \nelevated as compared to historical norms through fiscal 2025.\nDividends.\n Information concerning our dividends is set forth above under “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s \nCommon Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Report.\nCommon stock repurchases.\n \nDuring \nfiscal 2024\n, we repurchased \n2.5 million\n shares of our common stock under \nour share repurchase program for \n$554 million\n. At \nJanuary 3, 2025\n, we had a remaining unused authorization under \nour repurchase program of \n$3,381 million\n.\nDuring \nfiscal 2023\n, we repurchased \n2.5 million\n shares of our common stock under our share repurchase \nprogram for \n$518 million\n.\nT\nhe\n level and timing of our repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, \ncapital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our Board and \nmanagement may deem relevant. The timing, volume and nature of repurchases are also subject to market \nconditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or \ndiscontinued at any time. Additional information regarding our repurchase program is set forth above under “Item 5. \nMarket for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of \nthis Report.\nCash Requirements\nTotal Fixed-Rate Debt. \nAt \nJanuary 3, 2025\n, we had fixed-rate debt, which reflects our total long-term debt, \nincluding current portion but excluding finance leases, of \n$11.5 billion\n, of which \n$610 million\n is due within the next \n12 months. The majority of our fixed-rate debt has been incurred in connection with merger and acquisition activity. \nAdditionally, we have outstanding interest on fixed-rate debt of \n$4.9 billion\n, of which \n$534 million\n is due within the \nnext 12 months. See \nNote 8: Debt and Credit Arrangements\n in the Notes for further information regarding our fixed-\nrate debt.\nPurchase Obligations.\n At \nJanuary 3, 2025\n, we had purchase obligations \nof approximately\n \n$9.2 billion\n, of which \napproximately \n60%\n are due within the next 12 months. Our purchase obligations mainly consist of outstanding \ncommitments on open purchase orders made to suppliers, subcontractors and other outsourcing partners under \nU.S. Government contracts and \nmanaged service agreements\n.\n Our risk associated with these purchase obligations is \ngenerally limited to the termination liability provisions within such contracts. As such, we do not believe there to be \na material liquidity risk associated with outstanding purchase obligations.\nOperating and finance lease commitments.\n \n \nAt \nJanuary 3, 2025\n, we had operating and finance lease \ncommitments of \n$1.2 billion\n, of which \n$199 million\n \nis due within the next 12 months. See \nNote 11: Leases\n in the \nNotes for further information regarding our lease commitments.\nDefined Benefit Pension Contributions. \nWith respect to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, we \nintend to contribute annually no less than the required minimum funding thresholds. In \nfiscal 2024\n, we made \napproximately\n \n$30 million\n of contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. We expect to make \n_____________________________________________________________________\n30\napproximately\n \n$23 million\n of contributions to these plans in \nfiscal 2025\n and may consider voluntary contributions \nthereafter.\nFuture required contributions primarily will depend on the actual annual return on plan assets and the discount \nrate used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of each year. Depending on these factors, and the resulting \nfunded status of our pension plans, the level of future statutory required minimum contributions could be material. \nWe had net defined benefit plan assets of \n$789 million\n as of \nJanuary 3, 2025\n compared with \n$66 million\n as of \nDecember 29, 2023\n. The improvement in funded status as of \nJanuary 3, 2025\n is primarily due to more favorable \nthan expected return on plan assets and decreased pension obligations resulting from higher discount rates. See \nNote 9: Retirement Benefits\n in the Notes for further information regarding our pension plans.\nCommercial Commitments\nWe have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course of business including surety bonds, \nstandby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily \nrelating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers \nor to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. See \nNote 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and \nContingencies\n in the Notes for additional information. \nLiquidity Assessment\nGiven our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit ratings, available credit \nfacilities, cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any \nmaterial issues with liquidity for the next 12 months and in the longer term, although we can give no assurances \nconcerning our future liquidity, particularly in light of our overall level of debt, U.S. Government budget uncertainties \nand the state of global commerce and general political and global financial uncertainty.  \nBased on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, funds generated \nfrom operations, availability under our senior unsecured credit facilities and our \nCP Program\n and access to the public \nand private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated working capital requirements, \ncapital expenditures, dividend payments, repurchases under our share repurchase program and repayments of our \ndebt securities at maturity for the next 12 months and the reasonably foreseeable future thereafter. Our capital \nexpenditures for \nfiscal 2025\n are expected to be approximately \n2%\n of revenu\ne\n. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nPreparation of this Report in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect \nthe reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and backlog as well as disclosure of contingent assets \nand liabilities. While the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting estimates, we \nconsider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their \napplication places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on \nestimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Specific \nrisks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. The impact and any \nassociated risks described in the following paragraphs related to these estimates on our business operations are \ndiscussed throughout this MD&A where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. Senior \nmanagement has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related \ndisclosure included herein with the Audit Committee of our Board. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nA significant portion of our business is derived from development and production contracts. Revenue and profit \nrelated to development and production contracts are generally recognized over-time, typically using the percentage \nof completion (“\nPOC\n”) cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition, whereby we measure our progress towards \ncompletion of the performance obligation based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to estimated costs at \ncompletion under the contract. Because costs incurred represent work performed, we believe this method best \ndepicts the transfer of control of the asset to the customer. Under the POC cost-to-cost method of revenue \nrecognition, a single estimated profit margin is used to recognize profit for each performance obligation over its \nperiod of performance. \nRecognition of profit on a contract requires estimates of the total cost at completion and transaction price and \nthe measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the long-term nature of many of our contracts, developing \nthe estimated total cost at completion and total transaction price often requires judgment. Factors that must be \nconsidered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include: the nature and complexity of the work to be \nperformed, subcontractor performance, the cost and availability of purchased materials and services, labor cost and \navailability and the risk and impact of delayed performance. Factors that must be considered in estimating the total \n_____________________________________________________________________\n31\ntransaction price include contractual cost or performance incentives (such as incentive fees, award fees and \npenalties) and other forms of variable consideration as well as our historical experience and our expectation for \nperformance on the contract. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain \nnegotiated performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. \nWe include such estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of \ncumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is \nresolved.\nAt the outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost \nat completion in line with these expectations. We follow a standard EAC process in \nwhich\n we review the progress \nand performance on our ongoing contracts\n. \nIf we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule \nand cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the \nretirement of these risks. Conversely, there are many reasons estimated contract costs can increase, including: (i) \nsupply chain disruptions, inflation and labor issues; (ii) design or other development challenges; and (iii) program \nexecution challenges (including from technical or quality issues and other performance concerns). Additionally, as \nthe contract progresses, our estimates of total transaction price may increase or decrease if, for example, we \nreceive incentive or award fees that are higher or lower than expected. \nWhen changes in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total transaction price are determined, the \nrelated impact on operating income is recognized on a cumulative basis. Cumulative EAC adjustments represent the \ncumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods; revenue and operating margins in future periods are \nrecognized as if the revised estimates had been used since contract inception. Any anticipated losses on these \ncontracts are fully recognized in the period in which the losses become evident. In \nfiscal 2024\n and fiscal \n2023\n, \nearnings were impacted by recognition of net favorable EAC adjustments of \n$39 million\n and net unfavorable EAC \nadjustments of \n$85 million\n, respectively. \nDuring \nfiscal 2024\n, we recognized approximately \n$100 million\n in unfavorable EAC adjustments related to three \nclassified fixed-price development programs in \nSpace Systems,\n however,\n there were no individual EAC adjustments \nthat were material to our results of operations on a consolidated or segment basis in \nfiscal 2024\n or \n2023\n.\nWe recognize revenue from numerous contracts with multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we \nallocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of the \nproduct or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount for \nwhich we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not sold as a bundled sale with \nany other products or services). The allocation of transaction price among separate performance obligations may \nimpact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract. \nA substantial maj\nority of our revenue is derived from contracts with the U.S. Government, including foreign \nmilitary sales contracts. These contracts are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“\nFAR\n”) and the prices of \nour contract deliverables are typically based on our estimated or actual costs plus margin. As a result, the \nstandalone selling prices of the products and services in these contracts are typically equal to the selling prices \nstated in the contract, thereby eliminating the need to allocate (or reallocate) the transaction price to the multiple \nperformance obligations. In our non-U.S. Government contracts, when standalone selling prices are not directly \nobservable, we also generally use the expected cost plus margin approach to determine standalone selling price. In \ndetermining the appropriate margin under the cost plus margin approach, we consider historical margins on similar \nproducts sold to similar customers or within similar geographies where objective evidence is available. We may also \nconsider our cost structure and profit objectives, the nature of the proposal, the effects of customization of pricing, \nour practices used to establish pricing of bundled products, the expected technological life of the product, margins \nearned on similar contracts with different customers and other factors to determine the appropriate margin. \nDefined Benefit Plans\nCertain of our current and former employees participate in defined benefit plans in the U.S., Canada and United \nKingdom, which are sponsored by L3Harris. See \nNote 9: Retirement Benefits\n in the Notes for additional information \nrelated to our defined benefit plans.\nSignificant Assumptions\nThe determination of the projected benefit obligation (“\nPBO\n”) and recognition of net \nperiodic\n benefit income \nrelated to defined benefit plans depend on various assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan \nassets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, termination and other factors.\nWe develop assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. \nAssumptions are reviewed annually with third-party experts and adjusted as appropriate. \nActual resu\nl\nts that differ \n_____________________________________________________________________\n32\nfrom our assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized for each plan to the extent required over the \nestimated future life expectancy or, if applicable, the average remaining service period of the plan’s active \nparticipants.\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to determine the PBO:\nJanuary 3, 2025\nDecember 29, 2023\nPension\nOther\nBenefits\nPension\nOther\nBenefits\nDiscount rate\n5.46\n%\n5.38\n%\n4.91\n%\n4.87\n%\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit income:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 3, 2025\nDecember 29, 2023\nPension\nOther\nBenefits\nPension\nOther\nBenefits\nDiscount rate to determine service cost \n4.92\n%\n5.00\n%\n5.18\n%\n5.26\n%\nDiscount rate to determine interest cost\n4.80\n%\n4.78\n%\n5.08\n%\n5.06\n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n7.45\n%\n7.50\n%\n7.46\n%\n7.50\n%\nDiscount Rate. \nThe discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at \nthe measurement date. An increase in the discount rate decreases the \nPBO\n and generally decreases\n our net periodic \nbenefit income. A decrease in the discount rate increases the \nPBO\n and generally increases our net periodic benefit \nincome.\n The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income \ninvestments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The pension discount rate is determined by considering \nan interest rate yield curve comprising AAA/AA bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by \nthe plan’s actuaries. Annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop \na single discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics. \nSensitivity Analysis\n.\n The sensitivity of the PBO to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the \nmagnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. We estimate that a \n25 basis point\n change in the discount \nrate of our combined U.S. defined benefit pension plans would have the following impact on our PBO at \nJanuary 3, \n2025\n and net periodic benefit income for the next twelve months:\n(In millions)\n25 Basis\nPoint Increase\n25 Basis\nPoint Decrease\nPBO\n$\n(155)\n$\n161\nNet periodic benefit income\n$\n7\n$\n(8)\nExpected Return on Plan Assets.\n \nSubstantially all of our plan assets are managed on a commingled basis in a \nmaster investment trust. We determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and \nestimates of future returns. Specifically, we consider the plan’s actual historical annual return on assets over the \npast 15, 20 and 25 years and historical broad market returns over long-term timeframes based on our strategic \nallocation, which is detailed in \nNote 9: Retirement Benefits\n in the Notes. Future returns are based on independent \nestimates of long-term asset class returns. Based on this approach, the weighted average long-term annual rate of \nreturn on assets was estimated to be \n7.45%\n for both \nfiscal 2024\n and 2025.\nSensitivity Analysis. \nWe estimate that a \n25 basis point\n change in the expected return on plan assets of our \ncombined U.S. defined benefit pension plans would have the following impact on net periodic benefit income for the \nnext twelve months:\n(In millions)\n25 Basis\nPoint Increase\n25 Basis\nPoint Decrease\nNet periodic benefit income\n$\n(20)\n$\n20\nGoodwill\nWe test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first business day of our fourth fiscal quarter, which was \nSeptember 30\n in \nfiscal 2024\n, or under certain circumstances more frequently, such as when events or \ncircumstances indicate there may be impairment or when we reorganize our reporting structure such that the \ncomposition of one or more of our reporting units is affected. We test goodwill for impairment at a level within the \nCompany referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or one level below the business \n_____________________________________________________________________\n33\nsegment. Some of our segments are comprised of several reporting units. Allocation of goodwill to several reporting \nunits could make it more likely that we will have an impairment charge in the future. An impairment charge to any \none of our reporting units could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant \njudgment. To test goodwill for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. If we \nelect to perform a qualitative assessment for a certain reporting unit, we evaluate events and circumstances \nimpacting the reporting unit to determine the probability that goodwill is impaired. If we determine it is more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative \nassessment. \nOur qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific \nevents or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These \nfactors include: (i) deterioration in the general economy; (ii) deterioration in the environment in which we operate; \n(iii) increase in materials, labor or other costs; (iv) negative or declining cash flows; (v) changes in management, \nchanges in strategy or significant litigation; (vi) changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets or an \nexpectation of disposing all or a portion of the reporting unit; or (vii) a sustained decrease in share price. \nIf we perform a quantitative assessment for a certain reporting unit, we calculate the fair value of that reporting \nunit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value. We estimate fair values of our reporting units \nbased on projected cash flows. Values derived from projected cash flows are corroborated through review of \nrevenue and/or earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months’ revenue and earnings of our reporting units. \nProjected cash flows are based on our best estimate of future revenues, operating costs and balance sheet metrics \nreflecting our view of the financial and market conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash flows are \ndiscounted using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. The revenues and \nearnings multiples applied to the revenues and earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples of \nrevenues and earnings for similar businesses, and based on revenues and earnings multiples paid for recent \nacquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace. We then assess whether any implied control premium, \nbased on a comparison of fair value based purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair value \ndetermined by using all of the above-described models, is reasonable. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its \ncarrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit \nexceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. \nFiscal 2024 Impairment Tests.\n \nWe performed our annual impairment test of all of our reporting units’ goodwill \nas of \nSeptember 30, 2024\n and concluded that for each of our reporting units no impairment existed. \nBusiness realignment. \nEffective for \nfiscal 2024\n, to better align our businesses, we adjusted our IMS segment by \nrealigning our Electro Optical\n \nand Maritime sectors, which are also reporting units, splitting Electro Optical into two \nsectors, \nGlobal Optical Systems\n and Defense Electronics, and moving one Electro Optical business to the Maritime \nsector. \nGlobal Optical Systems\n and Defense Electronics represent one reporting unit. Immediately before and after \nthe realignment, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment under our former and new reporting unit \nstructure. These assessments indicated no impairment existed either before or after the realignment.\n  \nAntenna disposal group\n divestiture\n. For information related to the \nAntenna disposal group\n divestiture, including \ngoodwill allocation, impairment testing and resulting impairment see \nNote 6: Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n in the \nNotes. \nFiscal 2023 Impairment Tests.\n \nFor information related to fiscal 2023 impairment tests and resulting \nimpairments see \nNote 6: Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n in the Notes.\nAt-risk goodwill. \nBased on the \nfiscal 2024\n annual impairment testing, all of our reporting units had clearances \nabove 25%\n.\n \nBased on the \nfiscal 2023\n annual impairment testing, our Broadband reporting unit had clearance of \napproximately \n20%\n and goodwill of \n$2,656 million\n and our ISR and Electro Optical reporting units had clearances of \napproximately \n6%\n and goodwill of \n$3,186 million\n and \n$2,193 million\n, respectively. \nAn impairment of goodwill could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in \ndetermining the fair value of the reporting units; changes to U.S. Government spending priorities or ability to win \ncompetitively awarded contracts; an inability to meet our forecast; the rescission of significant contract awards as a \nresult of competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us; or an increase in interest rates without a \ncorresponding increase in future revenue.\nGoodwill-Related Fair Value Estimates.\n \nFair value determinations described above under the heading \n“Goodwill” in this Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A were determined based on a combination of \nmarket-based valuation techniques, utilizing quoted market prices, comparable publicly reported transactions, and \n_____________________________________________________________________\n34\nprojected discounted cash flows. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective \nand requires significant judgment. Material changes in these estimates could occur and result in additional \nimpairments in future periods.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby identifiable assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition and any \nexcess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is \nrecorded as goodwill. \nSee \nNote 13: Acquisitions and Divestitures\n in the Notes for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and \namounts reported in our \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We \nfollow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets \nrecorded on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. Future \nrealization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate \ncharacter (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under \nthe tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, \nprojected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax \nplanning strategies. We have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to determine our tax \nvaluation allowances during \nfiscal 2024\n.\nOur \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n as of \nJanuary 3, 2025\n included deferred tax assets of \n$120 million\n and \ndeferred tax liabilities of \n$942 million\n. For all jurisdictions in which we have net deferred tax assets, we expect that \nour existing levels of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income needed to \nrealize these tax assets. Our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets, which is reflected in our \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n, was \n$238 million\n as of \nJanuary 3, 2025\n. Although we make reasonable efforts to \nensure the accuracy of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain jurisdictions, or are \nunable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or \ntime period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the potential \nimpact of tax planning strategies changes, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a \nsignificant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a \nmaterial adverse impact on our operating results.\nThe evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, \ninvolves inherent uncertainty and requires the use of judgment. We evaluate our income tax positions and record tax \nbenefits for all years subject to examination based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances as of the \nreporting date. For tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we record the \nlargest amount of tax benefit with a greater than \n50%\n probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the \napplicable taxing authority, assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. For income \ntax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we do not recognize a tax benefit \nin our \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\nAs of \nJanuary 3, 2025\n, we had \n$758 million\n of unrecognized tax benefits, of which \n$666 million\n would favorably \nimpact our future tax rates in the event that the tax benefits are eventually recognized.  \nIt is reasonably possible that there could be a significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits during the \ncourse of the next twelve months as ongoing tax examinations continue, other tax examinations commence or \nvarious statutes of limitations expire. However, an estimate of the range of possible changes is not practicable for \nthe remaining unrecognized tax benefits because of the significant number of jurisdictions in which we do business \nand the number of open tax periods under various states of examination. See \nNote 7: Income Taxes\n in the Notes for \nadditional information. \nImpact of Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \nNote 1: Significant Accounting Policies\n \nin the Notes for information relating to the impact of recently adopted \nand issued accounting pronouncements.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n35",
