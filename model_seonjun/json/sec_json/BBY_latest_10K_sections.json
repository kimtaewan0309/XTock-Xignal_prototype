  "item1": "Item 1. Business.\n \nUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and the “company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites.\n \nDescription of Business\n \nWe were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966. \nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. \nWe accomplish this by leveraging our unique combination of tech expertise and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\n \nSegments and Geographic Areas\n \nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Essentials, Best Buy Health, Current Health, Geek Squad, Imagine That, Insignia, Lively, My Best Buy, My Best Buy Memberships, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird; and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. Our International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad and TechLiquidators and the domain names bestbuy.ca and techliquidators.ca.\n \nOperations\n \nOur Domestic and International segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business. Both segments operate an omnichannel platform that allows customers to come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes.\n \nDevelopment of merchandise and service offerings, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, online and mobile application operations, marketing and advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed. In addition, support capabilities (for example, human resources, finance, information technology and real estate management) operate primarily from our corporate headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail, services and in-home teams primarily from our corporate headquarters and regional locations. Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management, asset protection, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized. All stores generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market characteristics. While day-to-day operations of our stores are led by store management, more strategic decisions regarding, for example, store locations, format, category assortment and fulfillment strategy, are led by our corporate teams with input from market or regional leadership.\n \nOur Best Buy Health business has a dedicated leadership team that manages the day-to-day affairs of all aspects of its business, while receiving support from certain Best Buy enterprise capabilities.\n \nMerchandise and Services\n \nOur Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories. The key components of each revenue category are as follows:\n \n\nComputing and Mobile Phones\n - computing (including desktops, notebooks and peripherals), mobile phones (including related mobile network carrier commissions), networking, tablets (including e-readers) and wearables (including smartwatches);\n\nConsumer Electronics\n - digital imaging, health and fitness products, home theater (including home theater accessories, soundbars and televisions), portable audio (including headphones and portable speakers) and smart home;\n\nAppliances\n - large appliances (including dishwashers, laundry, ovens and refrigerators) and small appliances (including blenders, coffee makers, vacuums and personal care);\n\nEntertainment\n - drones, gaming (including hardware, peripherals and software), movies, toys, virtual reality and other software;\n\nServices\n - delivery, health-related services, installation, memberships, repair, set-up, technical support and warranty-related services; and\n\nOther\n - other product offerings, including baby, food and beverage and outdoor living.\n \nDistribution\n \nCustomers within our Domestic segment who purchase product online have the choice to have product delivered, or pick up product from a Best Buy store (including curbside pick-up for many products at most stores) or an alternative pick-up location. Our ship-from-store capability allows us to offer additional fast and convenient delivery options for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers. Distribution is similar for our International segment.\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n \nSuppliers and Inventory\n \nOur Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2025, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 80% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, HP, Sony and LG – representing approximately 55% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements.\n \nWe carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of consumer demand and product life cycles, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels and pricing, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives, and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products.\n \nWe also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brands products.\n \nStore Development\n \nWe had 1,117 stores at the end of fiscal 2025 throughout our Domestic and International segments. Our stores are a vital component of our omnichannel strategy, and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We also have vendor store-within-a-store concepts to allow closer vendor partnerships and a higher quality customer experience. We continuously look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations.\n \nIntellectual Property\n \nWe own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and trade names, including, but not limited to, \nBest Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Essentials, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, Best Buy Marketplace, Current Health, Geek Squad, Imagine That, Insignia, Jitterbug, Lively, Magnolia, My Best Buy, My Best Buy Memberships, Pacific Kitchen and Home, Pacific Sales, Rocketfish\n, \nTechLiquidators\n, \nYardbird \nand our \nYellow Tag\n logo.\n \nWe have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.\n \nSeasonality\n \nOur business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\n \nWorking Capital\n \nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes, investments and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.\n \nCompetition\n \nOur competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help customers online, in our stores and in their homes, and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs, provide us key competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers, as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people; our integrated online, retail and in-home assets; our broad and curated product assortment; our strong vendor partnerships; our service and support offerings designed to solve customer needs; our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats; and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.\n \nCorporate Responsibility & Sustainability (“CR&S”)\n \nAs we pursue our purpose to enrich lives through technology, we are committed to creating shared long-term value and positively impacting the world, the environment and the communities in which we operate through interactions with our stakeholders, including our customers, employees, vendor partners, community partners and shareholders.\n \nThe Nominating, Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors (“Board”) advises and oversees management regarding the effectiveness and risks of our CR&S strategy, programs and initiatives, including environmental goals and progress, corporate responsibility programs, initiatives and public policy positions and advocacy. \n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \nEnvironmental\n \nWe aspire to drive forward the circular economy, a system that aims to reduce waste and preserve resources. We focus on our highest-impact areas, including our operations, the energy we procure and the products we sell. These efforts contribute to mitigating climate risks, reducing potential risks to our business and generating long-term cost savings.\n \nIn our operations, we strive to reduce the use of natural resources. We believe the following focus areas help to reduce the use of natural resources and our impact on the environment while improving our efficiency and profitability:\n \n\nWe aim to reduce our carbon emissions by minimizing energy usage, advocating for a cleaner grid and sourcing renewable energy\n.\n\nWe monitor our water consumption across our business to identify and manage programs that lessen our dependence on water\n. \n\nTo reduce waste and maximize resource efficiency, we continue our efforts to build a more sustainable supply chain by focusing on certifying our supply chain locations as TRUE zero waste\n.\n \nOur focus on sustainable products centers on helping our customers reduce their impact on the environment through the products we sell. We do this by providing a variety of energy-efficient products for our customers.\n \nWe also support the circular economy by keeping consumer products in use for as long as possible through our repair and trade-in services. We put materials back into the manufacturing process when products reach the end of their lives through our electronics and appliance recycling program. In fiscal 2025, we continued to evolve our industry-leading e-waste recycling program and found additional ways to incentivize recycling.\n \nHuman Rights and Responsible Sourcing\n \nWe are committed to respecting human rights through our alignment with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n \nFurther, across all the products and services we procure, we seek to mitigate risk and enhance our partnership with suppliers and create value for all stakeholders through our Responsible Sourcing Program. We are active members of the Responsible Business Alliance, as are many of the major brands we sell, which allows us to partner across initiatives and increase our impact. Collectively, we embrace a common Supplier Code of Conduct and audit methodology that creates business value by improving working conditions and environmental practices throughout the supply chain.\n \nSocial Impact\n \nWe are committed to helping teens build brighter futures and increasing access to technology for the tech-reliant careers of the future. We believe our employee volunteer programs, like Geek Squad Academy, help to spark excitement and interest in technology for young learners while engaging our employees’ unique technical expertise. \n \nBest Buy also serves as a fiscal sponsor of the Best Buy Foundation™, whose signature Best Buy Teen Tech Center® program consists of a network of youth-centered community hubs where teens can engage with the latest technology, learn career skills, and interact with safe and supportive mentors. As of February 1, 2025, the Best Buy Foundation™ supported a network of 68 Best Buy Teen Tech Center\n®\n locations across the U.S. and Canada.\n \n \nHuman Capital Management \n \nWe believe in the power of our people. Our culture is built on the belief that engaged and committed employees – supported by opportunities to learn, grow, innovate and explore – can lead to extraordinary outcomes. At the end of fiscal 2025, we employed approximately 85,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada.\n \nInclusion and Belonging\n \nWe believe in an inclusive work environment with a culture of belonging where everyone feels valued, can thrive and has equal opportunities at all levels in the organization. At the core of this environment are our company values, which were founded decades ago and focus, in part, on what it means to unleash the power of our people, as individuals, so everyone can learn, grow and be the best version of themselves. We believe that creating this environment is the right thing to do and has been key to our long-term business success.\n \nOur Executive Leadership Team and Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board supports the development of a culture of belonging and engagement through oversight of our human resources policies and programs. The Nominating, Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee of our Board recommends criteria for the selection of individuals to be considered as candidates for election to the Board.\n \n‎\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n \nTraining and Development\n \nWe continue to invest in our employees and build a culture focused on developing our talent. Prioritizing foundational and leadership skill development helps to meet employees where they are at, which creates a more adaptable and resilient workforce and enhances our competitive advantage. Additionally, we believe by investing in employee training and development we can create a better employee environment and increase productivity, retention and innovation that ultimately improves our overall company performance and brings value to stakeholders. With the continued goal of creating learning opportunities that are tailored to the unique work of each role and a focus on solving the most important problems in our business, we expanded our variety of training experiences in fiscal 2025. This included new learning campaigns, leadership programs and expanded side-by-side trainings to support employee growth alongside their peers and leaders in condensed training formats.\n \nExamples of enhancements in fiscal 2025 include:\n \n\nWe evolved our leadership development offerings to grow and transform Best Buy for its future. These offerings included unique programs such as an enterprise-wide manager development program, a skill development program for our senior store leaders and several emerging talent programs including an officer readiness program.\n\nWe expanded our learning campaigns, reaching thousands of employees for new products to include a closer partnership with our vendors, more exposure for our employees and in-depth training in artificial intelligence to help customers with the products they use.\n\nWe enhanced our portfolio of risk, compliance and safety microlearning courses to enable employees to continuously develop safe, secure and ethical behaviors to protect the company.\n \nEmployee Benefits\n \nOur benefits aim to support employees’ overall well-being: physical, mental, financial and work-life. We believe our ability to deliver on our purpose of enriching our customers’ lives depends on ensuring our employees are living happy and healthy lives — both while at work and outside of work. In fiscal 2025, we introduced the following benefits to our employees\n:\n \n\nA well-being sabbatical for employees with five or more years of service that provides them an opportunity to take four weeks off (once every three years) to focus on their well-being.\n\nAdditional paid time off each year in recognition of tenure for full-time employees with 20 or more years of service, plus additional tiers for part-time employees at three and six years. \n\nFive floating holidays and two fixed company holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas Day) in place of seven fixed holidays for U.S. employees, to give flexibility for employees to celebrate what is meaningful to them.\n \nAdditionally, in fiscal 2025, we continued our focus on:\n \n\nCaregiver support, including: \no\nAccess to Joshin, a support system for employees and their loved ones with a focus on disabilities and neurodivergence;\no\nPersonalized help in a time of great need through Wellthy, a program that helps with emergency housing, healthcare, substance abuse, complex eldercare issues and other moments of crisis;\no\nPay continuation (paid leave) and caregiver pay so employees can care for themselves and their loved ones;\no\nParental leave for U.S. employees that provides eligible birth parents 100% pay for 10 weeks and eligible non-birth parents 100% pay for four weeks;\n\nUp to $2,500 in financial assistance to employees experiencing personal hardship through the HOPE Fund – Helping Our People in Emergencies – in partnership with the Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation; \n\nMental health support, including our commitment to raise awareness by equipping employees with training to notice issues in themselves or others, and then find help; and \n\nTuition assistance, including the expansion of our partnership schools that give eligible employees the opportunity to earn a degree with no out-of-pocket costs.\n \nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board oversees risks related to our human capital management through its regular review of our practices, policies and programs, which includes overall employee wellness and engagement in these areas, employee benefit plan compliance, leadership succession planning and wage, retention and hiring programs.\n \nFor more information on CR&S matters, as well as human capital management, please see Best Buy’s Fiscal 2025 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report expected to be published later this year, at https://corporate.bestbuy.com/reports-and-resources.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Op\nerations.\n \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nRefer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, for discussion of the results of operations for the year ended February 3, 2024, compared to the year ended January 28, 2023, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n \n \nOverview\n \nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life\n. We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of tech expertise and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\n \nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Essentials, Best Buy Health, Current Health, Geek Squad, Imagine That, Insignia, Lively, My Best Buy, My Best Buy Memberships, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird; and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. Our International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad and TechLiquidators and the domain names bestbuy.ca and techliquidators.ca.\n \nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. \nFiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 ended on February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024, and January 28, 2023, respectively. \nFiscal 2025 and fiscal 2023 each included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks with the 53\nrd\n week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter. \nUnless otherwise noted, references to years within the MD&A section of this report relate to fiscal years, not calendar years. \nOur business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\n \nComparable Sales\n \nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to have product delivered, or pick up product in store, curbside or at an alternative pick-up location. Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. Comparable sales excludes the impact of certain periodic warranty-related profit-share revenue, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only) and the impact of the 53\nrd\n week (applicable in 53-week fiscal years only). \nComparable sales is based on our fiscal calendar and is not adjusted to align calendar weeks. \nAll periods presented apply this methodology consistently.\n \nConsistent with our comparable sales policy, revenue from Best Buy Express locations rebranded as a result of our previously announced collaboration with Bell Canada is excluded from our comparable sales calculation until locations have been operating for at least 14 full months.\n \nWe believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores, websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.\n \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n \nBeginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we renamed our non-GAAP financial measures to adjusted financial measures; for example, consolidated non-GAAP operating income has been renamed to consolidated adjusted operating income. The methodology for calculating these measures remains unchanged, and therefore any previously reported non-GAAP financial measures that are renamed to corresponding adjusted financial measures remain unchanged. \n \n‎\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n \nThis MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, consolidated adjusted operating income rate, consolidated adjusted effective tax rate and consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide additional useful information for evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts and financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on sales of subsidiaries and certain investments, amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. We provide reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures that enable investors to understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and to evaluate performance using the same metrics as management. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.\n \nIn our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segment’s operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use the term “constant currency,” which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.\n \nRefer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting consolidated adjusted operating income, consolidated adjusted effective tax rate and consolidated adjusted diluted EPS in the presented periods.\n \nBusiness Strategy Update\n \nOur strategy for fiscal 2026 involves three key priorities:\n \nOmni-channel enhancements\n \nStarting with our digital experiences, we intend to improve our search and discover capability to make it easier for our customers to find what they want and need. We will leverage artificial intelligence (“AI”) to launch an innovative new search experience across our websites and apps. We will also leverage AI to enhance personalization, which we believe will drive both customer engagement and sales conversion.\n \nIn our physical stores, we expect to prioritize merchandising and store health and appearance updates over large-scale remodels, building on the insights we have gained from testing and changes implemented within our stores in recent years. From a store labor perspective, we will focus on enhancements and optimization, building on the significant operating model changes we have made in recent years that were designed to provide the experience our customers expect in the most efficient way possible.\n \nInvestment in new growth initiatives\n \nWe are targeting a mid-fiscal 2026 launch for our new Best Buy Marketplace (“Marketplace”) within our Domestic segment, which we believe will complement our existing product assortment with access to a broader range of products offered by Marketplace sellers. We believe this will unlock potential new commission and advertising revenue, without requiring our investment in inventory. \n \nWe have recently elevated our focus on Best Buy Ads, our retail media network, and we see fiscal 2026 as a pivotal year. In recent years, Best Buy Ads has primarily served our merchandise vendors. In fiscal 2026, we will continue this evolution and also expect Best Buy Ads to expand into other areas of opportunity. In order to support this growth, we plan to invest in technology capabilities, our Best Buy Ads team and other new third-party partnerships.\n \nOperational efficiency\n \nOur third strategic priority for fiscal 2026 is to continue our longstanding commitment to operational efficiency by identifying cost reductions and other savings to help fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives and offset financial pressures facing our business.\n \n‎\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n \nTariffs\n \nWe enter fiscal 2026 facing significant uncertainty regarding the scope, timing and magnitude of tariffs we may experience for the products we sell and the consequent financial impact on our business. In conjunction with our vendors, we will seek to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our business and our customers. For more information regarding the potential impacts of tariffs on our business, refer to Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nResults of Operations\n \nConsolidated Results\n \nIn fiscal 2025, we continued to manage our profitability through strong execution despite revenue declines. As we entered the year, we were operating in an uneven environment and expected there would be industry pressure. Our strategy was to focus on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while optimizing our operating income rate. \n \nSelected consolidated financial data was as follows ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\n(1)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n2023\nRevenue\n$\n 41,528 \n \n \n$\n 43,452 \n \n \n$\n 46,298 \n \nRevenue % change\n \n (4.4)\n%\n \n \n (6.1)\n%\n \n \n (10.6)\n%\nComparable sales % change\n \n (2.3)\n%\n \n \n (6.8)\n%\n \n \n (9.9)\n%\nGross profit\n$\n 9,385 \n \n \n$\n 9,603 \n \n \n$\n 9,912 \n \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n(1)\n \n 22.6 \n%\n \n \n 22.1 \n%\n \n \n 21.4 \n%\nSG&A\n$\n 7,651 \n \n \n$\n 7,876 \n \n \n$\n 7,970 \n \nSG&A as a % of revenue\n(1)\n \n 18.4 \n%\n \n \n 18.1 \n%\n \n \n 17.2 \n%\nRestructuring charges\n$\n (3)\n \n \n$\n 153 \n \n \n$\n 147 \n \nGoodwill impairment\n$\n 475 \n \n \n$\n -\n \n \n$\n -\n \nOperating income\n$\n 1,262 \n \n \n$\n 1,574 \n \n \n$\n 1,795 \n \nOperating income as a % of revenue\n \n 3.0 \n%\n \n \n 3.6 \n%\n \n \n 3.9 \n%\nNet earnings\n$\n 927 \n \n \n$\n 1,241 \n \n \n$\n 1,419 \n \nDiluted EPS\n$\n 4.28 \n \n \n$\n 5.68 \n \n \n$\n 6.29 \n \n(1)\nBecause retailers vary in how they\n record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and SG&A, refer to Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nIn fiscal 2025, we generated $41.5 billion in revenue, compared to $43.5 billion in fiscal 2024 that included approximately $735 million in revenue from the 53\nrd\n week. Our comparable sales declined 2.3% in fiscal 2025, \nas we continued to operate in a challenged consumer electronics industry and experienced softer consumer demand. While our comparable sales declined in fiscal 2025 in categories such as appliances, home theater and gaming, we grew comparable sales in our computing, tablet and services categories.\n \nRestructuring charges in fiscal 2025 were primarily comprised of adjustments to employee termination benefits related to previously planned organizational changes and higher-than-expected employee retention associated with an\n enterprise-wide initiative that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. \nRefer to Note 2, \nRestructuring\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n \nThe goodwill impairment in fiscal 2025 was related to our Best Buy Health reporting unit. \nThe impairment primarily arose from downward revisions of our revenue growth rates and margin rates compared to projections used in prior years. \nRefer to Note 3, \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n \nOperating income rate decreased in fiscal 2025, primarily due to the goodwill impairment and unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in the gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges. \n \nDiluted EPS decreased in fiscal 2025, primarily due to lower operating income.\n \nRevenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2025 were primarily driven by our Domestic segment.

As we approach the expiration of leases, we evaluate various options for each location, including whether a store should remain open. In fiscal 2026, we currently expect to reduce our Domestic segment Best Buy store count by approximately 5 to 10 stores.\n \nIn fiscal 2024, we announced our collaboration with Bell Canada to rebrand 167 of its stores to Best Buy Express. These stores, previously part of The Source, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Canada, are leased by Bell Canada and therefore excluded from our store count. Under the arrangement, we provide the curated consumer electronics assortment and Geek Squad services, as well as supply chain, marketing and e-commerce support. Bell Canada is the exclusive telecommunications services provider and is also responsible for the store operations. By the end of fiscal 2025, all of the 167 stores have been rebranded.\n \nIncome Tax Expense\n \nIncome tax expense decreased to $372 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $381 million in fiscal 2024, primarily due to the impact of decreased pre-tax earnings, partially offset by the impact of certain expenses that are not tax deductible. Our effective tax rate increased to 28.7% in fiscal 2025 compared to 23.5% in fiscal 2024, primarily due to the impacts of certain expenses that are not tax deductible \nand lower pre-tax earnings, partially offset by increased tax benefits from green energy incentives.\n \nSegment Performance Summary\n \nDomestic Segment\n \nSelected financial data for the Domestic segment was as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n2023\nRevenue\n$\n 38,238 \n \n \n$\n 40,097 \n \n \n$\n 42,794 \n \nRevenue % change\n \n (4.6)\n%\n \n \n (6.3)\n%\n \n \n (10.5)\n%\nComparable sales % change\n(1)\n \n (2.5)\n%\n \n \n (7.1)\n%\n \n \n (10.3)\n%\nGross profit\n$\n 8,647 \n \n \n$\n 8,850 \n \n \n$\n 9,106 \n \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n \n 22.6 \n%\n \n \n 22.1 \n%\n \n \n 21.3 \n%\nAdjusted SG&A\n(2)\n$\n 7,000 \n \n \n$\n 7,175 \n \n \n$\n 7,246 \n \nAdjusted SG&A as a % of revenue\n(3)\n \n 18.3 \n%\n \n \n 17.9 \n%\n \n \n 16.9 \n%\nAdjusted operating income\n(2)\n$\n 1,647 \n \n \n$\n 1,675 \n \n \n$\n 1,860 \n \nAdjusted operating income as a % of revenue\n(4)\n \n 4.3 \n%\n \n \n 4.2 \n%\n \n \n 4.3 \n%\nSelected Online Revenue Data\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal online revenue\n$\n 12,994 \n \n \n$\n 13,102 \n \n \n$\n 14,212 \n \nOnline revenue as a % of total segment revenue\n \n 34.0 \n%\n \n \n 32.7 \n%\n \n \n 33.2 \n%\nComparable online sales % change\n(1)\n \n (0.8)\n%\n \n \n (7.8)\n%\n \n \n (13.5)\n%\n \n(1)\nComparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation.\n(2)\nRepresents Domestic segment Adjusted SG&A and Domestic segment Adjusted operating income as reported in accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n.

There is no income tax for a portion of the U.S. non-GAAP adjustments, as there is no tax benefit on the expenses in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense\n. \n \nAdjusted operating income rate increased in fiscal 2025, primarily due to a favorable gross profit rate in our Domestic segment, partially offset by an unfavorable SG&A rate in our Domestic segment.\n \nAdjusted effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2025, primarily due to \nincreased tax benefits from green energy incentives.\n \nAdjusted diluted EPS in fiscal 2025 remained unchanged from fiscal 2024, as the decrease in adjusted earnings was offset by lower diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nWe closely manage our liquidity and capital \nresources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. \nWe modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment.\n \nCash and cash equivalents were as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 1, 2025\n \nFebruary 3, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n 1,578 \n \n \n$\n 1,447 \n \n \nThe increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to positive cash flows from operations, primarily driven by earnings\n. These increases were partially offset by dividend payments, capital expenditures and share repurchases.\n \n \nOur cash deposits held at financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit. We limit exposure relating to financial instruments by diversifying the financial instruments among various counterparties, which consist primarily of major financial institutions.\n \nCash Flows\n \nCash flows were as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOperating activities\n$\n 2,098 \n \n \n$\n 1,470 \n \n \n$\n 1,824 \n \nInvesting activities\n \n (704)\n \n \n \n (781)\n \n \n \n (962)\n \nFinancing activities\n \n (1,309)\n \n \n \n (1,144)\n \n \n \n (1,806)\n \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n \n (10)\n \n \n \n (5)\n \n \n \n (8)\n \nIncrease (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n 75 \n \n \n$\n (460)\n \n \n$\n (952)\n \n \nOperating Activities\n \nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2025, primarily driven by the timing and volume of inventory purchases and payments, partially offset by the timing of vendor funding receivables. \n \nInvesting Activities\n \nCash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal 2025, primarily driven by lower capital spending.\n \nFinancing Activities\n \nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal 2025, primarily driven by higher share repurchases.\n \nSources of Liquidity\n \nFunds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables are our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic initiatives, including business combinations. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.\n \nWe have a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the “Five-Year Facility Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that expires in April 2028. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Five-Year Facility Agreement as of February 1, 2025, or February 3, 2024.\n \nThe Five-Year Facility Agreement contains a covenant that requires the company to maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio. The Five-Year Facility Agreement contains customary default provisions, including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants. \nAs of February 1, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants. If an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under the Five-Year Facility Agreement as well.\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n \nOur credit ratings and outlook as of March 17, 2025, \nremained unchanged from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, and are summarized below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRating Agency\nRating\n \nOutlook\nStandard & Poor's\nBBB+\n \nStable\nMoody's\nA3\n \nStable\n \nCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, changes in our operating performance; the economic environment, regulatory and political environment; conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries; our competitive standing within the industries we operate; our financial position; and changes in our business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, interest costs for certain of our credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store leasing costs.\n \nRestricted Cash\n \nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to cover product protection plans provided under our membership offerings and self-insurance liabilities. Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $290 million and $346 million as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was primarily due to releases of product protection reserves based on claims and purchasing behaviors of customers participating in our membership offerings.\n \nCapital Expenditures\n \nCapital expenditures were as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n2023\nE-commerce and information technology\n$\n 438 \n \n \n$\n 496 \n \n \n$\n 540 \n \nStore-related projects\n(1)\n \n 230 \n \n \n \n 278 \n \n \n \n 355 \n \nSupply chain\n \n 38 \n \n \n \n 21 \n \n \n \n 35 \n \nTotal capital expenditures\n$\n 706 \n \n \n$\n 795 \n \n \n$\n 930 \n \n(1)\nStore-related projects are primarily comprised of store remodels and various merchandising projects.\n \nWe currently expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 of $700 million to $750 million.\n \nDebt and Capital\n \nAs of February 1, 2025, \nwe had $500 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”) and $650 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2030 (“2030 Notes”). \nRefer to Note 7, \nDebt\n, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \nincluded in Item 8, \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information \nabout our outstanding debt.\n \nShare Repurchases and Dividends\n \nWe repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board of Directors (“Board”). The payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. Our share repurchase plans are evaluated on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as our financial condition and cash flows, our economic outlook, the impact of tax laws, our liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on such factors.\n \nOn February 28, 2022, our Board approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase program. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.\n \nShare repurchase and dividend activity were as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n2023\nTotal cost of shares repurchased\n$\n500\n \n \n$\n 340 \n \n \n$\n 1,001 \n \nAverage price per share\n$\n86.42\n \n \n$\n 72.52 \n \n \n$\n 84.78 \n \nTotal number of shares repurchased\n \n5.8\n \n \n \n 4.7 \n \n \n \n 11.8 \n \nRegular quarterly cash dividends per share\n$\n3.76\n \n \n$\n 3.68 \n \n \n$\n 3.52 \n \nCash dividends declared and paid\n$\n 807 \n \n \n$\n 801 \n \n \n$\n 789 \n \n \nThe total cost of shares repurchased increased in fiscal 2025 from increases in the volume of repurchases and the average price per share.\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n \nCash dividends declared and paid increased in fiscal 2025, primarily due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend per share, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. On March 4, 2025\n, we announced the Board’s approval of a 1% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.95 per share.\n \nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\n \nWe do not have outstanding off-balance-sheet arrangements.

Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they do not contain legally binding purchase commitments, we include open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.\n(2)\nOperating lease obligations exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $0.7 billion as of February 1, 2025. Operating \nlease obligations also exclude $19 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced\n.\n(3)\nLong-term debt obligations represent principal amounts only and exclude interest rate swap valuation adjustments.\n(4)\nInterest payments related to our 2028 Notes and 2030 Notes include the variable interest rate payments included in our interest rate swaps.\n \nAdditionally, we have $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our Five-Year Facility Agreement as of February 1, 2025, which, if drawn upon, would be included in either short-term or long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n \nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty.\n \nVendor Allowances\n \nDescription\nWe receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or sales-based volumes and for product advertising and placement\n. We recognize vendor allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. Vendor allowances for\n advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense within SG&A when incurred.\n \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nDue to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory. These estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including proper classification of the type of funding received and the methodology to estimate the portion of purchases-based funding that should be recognized in cost of sales in each period, which considers factors such as inventory-turn by product category and actual sell-through of inventory.\n \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in our vendor funding deferral as of February 1, 2025, would have affected net earnings by approximately $45 million in fiscal 2025. The level of vendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\n \n\n\n31\n\n\nGoodwill\n \nDescription\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value reflects our estimate of the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction. \n \nWe have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic (comprising our core U.S. Best Buy business) and Best Buy Health – with carrying values of $492 million and $416 million, respectively, as of February 1, 2025.\n \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit requires complex analysis and judgment. We use a combination of discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis and market data, such as revenue multiples and quoted market prices, for observable comparable companies. DCF analysis requires detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers, such as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments, and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. These estimates incorporate many uncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and macroeconomic trends.\n \nEffects if actual results differ from assumptions\nFor our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, fair value is primarily derived from market data and exceeded carrying value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. Barring a fundamental, material deterioration of macroeconomic factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit is remote. \n \nIn fiscal 2025, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $475 million for the Best Buy Health reporting unit. The impairment was identified during the fourth quarter as a result of our annual impairment review. This coincides with our annual review of performance against financial and strategic goals, and the annual update of our budget and long-range financial projections. Fair value for the Best Buy Health reporting unit is estimated primarily based on DCF analysis. The impairment primarily arose from downward revisions of our revenue growth rates and margin rates compared to projections used in prior years, as the market has not scaled as we originally forecasted. \n \nOur Best Buy Health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty compared to our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, since it operates in a more uncertain environment. Factors that drive this uncertainty include macro-economic conditions, the regulatory environment, government funding programs, competitor actions, technology changes and other trends in the health and care sectors. Changes in any of these factors could lead to further lowering our expectations, which could result in further goodwill impairment.\n \nInventory Markdown\n \nDescription\nWe value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we expect to return to our vendors for full credit.\n \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nMarkdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for selling current inventory. Such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, regulatory actions, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. We also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs.\n \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in our markdown adjustment as of February 1, 2025, would have affected net earnings by approximately $11 million in fiscal 2025. The level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\n \nTax Contingencies\n \nDescription\nOur income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.\n \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors, such as changes in tax law, interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending.\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nTo the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. \n \nService Revenue\n \nDescription\nWe sell membership plans that include access to benefits such as technical support, price discounts on certain products and services and product protection plans. We allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. For performance obligations provided over the term of the contract, we typically recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns, primarily derived from historical information.\n \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nEstimates involve complex calculations and judgment, for example, in estimating the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations; the appropriate recognition methodology for each performance obligation; and, for those based on usage, the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of customers. When insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated.\n \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of February 1, 2025, would have affected net earnings by approximately $43 million in fiscal 2025. The level of services membership deferred revenue has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\n \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \nFor a description of applicable new accounting pronouncements, including our assessment of the impact on our financial statements, see Note 1, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
