However, DTE Electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to DTE Energy or the subsidiaries of DTE Energy other than itself.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nDTE Energy is a diversified energy company and is the parent company of DTE Electric and DTE Gas, regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution, and storage services throughout Michigan.  DTE Energy also operates two energy-related non-utility segments with operations throughout the United States.\nThe following table summarizes DTE Energy's financial results:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company\n$\n419\n \n$\n477 \n$\n1,093\n \n$\n1,112 \nDiluted Earnings per Common Share\n$\n2.01\n \n$\n2.30 \n$\n5.26\n \n$\n5.36 \nThe decrease in Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to greater losses at Corporate and Other and lower earnings in the Gas segment, partially offset by higher earnings in the Electric segment.  The decrease for the nine-month period was primarily due to greater losses at Corporate and Other, partially offset by higher earnings in the Electric, DTE Vantage, and Gas segments.\nSTRATEGY\nDTE Energy's strategy is to achieve long-term earnings per share growth with a strong balance sheet and attractive dividend.\nDTE Energy's utilities are investing capital to support a modern, reliable grid and cleaner, affordable energy through investments in base infrastructure and new generation.  Increasing intensity of windstorms and other weather events, coupled with increasing electric vehicle adoption and potential for data centers, will drive a continued need for substantial grid investment over the long-term.\nDTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions of its electric utility operations by 65% in 2028, 85% in 2032, and 90% by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels.  DTE Energy plans to end its use of coal-fired power plants in 2032 and is committed to a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 for its electric and gas utility operations.\nAdditionally, as a result of legislation passed by the state of Michigan in 2023, DTE Energy will be required to meet a 100% clean energy portfolio standard by 2040.  Clean energy sources include renewables, nuclear, and natural gas-fired plants equipped with a carbon capture and storage system that is at least 90% effective in reducing carbon emissions to the atmosphere.  The legislation also requires 50% of an electric utility's energy to be generated from renewable sources by 2030 and 60% by 2035.  DTE Energy is currently assessing the impacts of this legislation and will include updates in its next Integrated Resource Plan, currently planned for 2026, to comply with the new requirements.\nTo achieve carbon reduction goals at the electric utility, DTE Energy will continue its transition away from coal-powered energy sources and is replacing or offsetting the generation from these facilities with renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage, and energy waste reduction initiatives.  Refer to the \"Capital Investments\" section below for further discussion regarding DTE Energy's retirement of its aging coal-fired plants and transition to renewable energy and other sources.  Over the long-term, DTE Energy is also monitoring and pursuing the advancement of emerging technologies such as long-duration storage, modular nuclear reactors, and carbon capture and sequestration, and how these technologies may support clean, reliable generation and customer affordability.\n55\nTable of Contents\nFor the gas utility, DTE Energy aims to cut carbon emissions across the entire value chain.  DTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions from its gas utility operations by 65% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, and is committed to a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 from internal gas operations and gas suppliers.  To achieve net zero, DTE Energy is working to source gas with lower methane intensity, reduce emissions through its gas main renewal and pipeline integrity programs, and if necessary, use carbon offsets to address any remaining emissions.  DTE Energy also aims to help DTE Gas customers reduce their emissions by approximately 35% by 2040 by increasing energy efficiency, pursuing advanced technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration, and through the CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program which provides customers the option to use carbon offsets and renewable natural gas.\nDTE Energy expects that these initiatives at the electric and gas utilities will continue to provide significant opportunities for capital investments and result in earnings growth.  DTE Energy is focused on executing its plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability.  To support its goals for customer affordability, DTE Energy is working to implement operational efficiencies and optimize opportunities from the Inflation Reduction Act to generate tax credits relating to renewable energy, nuclear generation, energy storage, and carbon capture and sequestration.  These tax credits may reduce the cost of owning related assets and reduce customer rate impacts from any future cost recoveries.  DTE Energy's utilities operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with their regulators.\nDTE Energy also has significant investments in non-utility businesses and expects growth opportunities in its DTE Vantage segment.  DTE Energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets, skills, and expertise, and provides attractive returns and diversity in earnings and geography.  Specifically, DTE Energy invests in targeted markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile.\nA key priority for DTE Energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced financing.  Growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity.  DTE Energy has an enterprise risk management program that, among other things, is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes, interest rates, and counterparty credit risk.\nCAPITAL INVESTMENTS\nDTE Energy's utility businesses will require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and achieve goals for carbon emission reductions.  Capital plans may be regularly updated as these requirements and goals evolve and may be subject to regulatory approval.\nDTE Electric's capital investments over the 2026-2030 period are estimated at $30 billion, comprised of $11 billion for distribution infrastructure, $4 billion for base infrastructure, and $15 billion for cleaner generation including renewables.\nDTE Electric has retired all eleven coal-fired generation units at the Trenton Channel, River Rouge, and St. Clair facilities, and plans to repurpose the Trenton Channel plant to a battery energy storage system in 2026.  DTE Electric has also announced plans to retire its remaining six coal-fired generating units, including converting the two units at the Belle River facility from a base load coal plant to a natural gas peaking resource in the second half of 2025 and 2026.  The four units at the Monroe facility are expected to be retired in two stages in 2028 and 2032.  Generation from the retired facilities will continue to be replaced or offset with a combination of renewables, energy waste reduction, demand response, battery storage, and natural gas fueled generation.\nDTE Gas' capital investments over the 2026-2030 period are estimated at $4.5 billion, comprised of $2.7 billion for base infrastructure and $1.8 billion for the gas renewal program, which includes main and service renewals, meter move-out, and pipeline integrity projects.\nDTE Electric and DTE Gas plan to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment.\nDTE Energy's non-utility businesses' capital investments are primarily for expansion, growth, and ongoing maintenance in the DTE Vantage segment, including approximately $2.0 billion from 2026-2030 for custom energy solutions and renewable energy, while expanding into carbon capture and sequestration.\n56\nTable of Contents\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulations, including those addressing climate change.  Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented.  Actual costs to comply could vary substantially.  The Registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers, as authorized by the MPSC.\nIncreased costs for energy produced from traditional coal-based sources due to recent, pending, and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable, natural gas fueled generation, and/or nuclear sources, energy waste reduction initiatives, and the potential development of market-based trading of carbon instruments.\nFor further discussion of environmental matters, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nOUTLOOK\nThe next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE Energy and for the energy industry.  DTE Energy's strong utility base, combined with its integrated non-utility operations, position it well for long-term growth.\nLooking forward, DTE Energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance:\n•\nelectric and gas customer satisfaction;\n•\nelectric distribution system reliability;\n•\nnew electric generation and storage;\n•\ngas distribution system renewal;\n•\nreducing carbon emissions at the electric and gas utilities;\n•\nrate competitiveness and affordability;\n•\nregulatory stability and investment recovery for the electric and gas utilities;\n•\nstrategic investments in growth projects at DTE Vantage;\n•\nemployee engagement and health, safety, and wellbeing;\n•\ncost structure optimization across all business segments; and\n•\ncash, capital, and liquidity to maintain or improve financial strength.\nDTE Energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic, financial, and risk criteria.\n57\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of DTE Energy's segments.

Differences between the Electric segment and DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Operations are primarily due to non-utility operations at DTE Sustainable Generation (some of which includes intra-segment activity that is eliminated in consolidation) and the classification of certain benefit costs.  Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets\" for additional information.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOperating Revenues\n increased $354 million and $413 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.  Revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges, including recovery of fuel and purchased power, are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The increase in both periods was due to the following:\nThree Months\nNine Months\n(In millions)\nInterconnection sales\n$\n55 \n$\n169 \nImplementation of new rates\n63 \n145 \nPower Supply Cost Recovery\n(a)\n98 \n71 \nWeather\n11 \n33 \nRate mix\n5 \n30 \nNon-utility revenues\n(b)\n12 \n12 \nRegulatory Mechanism — RPS\n(c)\n108 \n(14)\nBase sales\n3 \n(36)\nOther regulatory mechanisms and other\n(1)\n3 \n$\n354\n \n$\n413\n \n______________________________\n(a)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the variance includes an MPSC disallowance of $28 million resulting from an order in DTE Electric's 2022 PSCR reconciliation case.  The disallowance reduced the amount of power supply costs recoverable from customers, which had a flow-through impact of approximately $5 million higher interest expense recorded separately to Other (Income) and Deductions.\n(b)\nThe increase in both periods was primarily due to the acquisition of a non-utility business by DTE Sustainable Generation during the third quarter 2025.  Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Acquisition,\" for additional information.\n(c)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, the change is primarily driven by the impact of solar ITCs recognized for assets placed in service in the third quarter of 2024.  This impact is offset in Income Tax Expense (Benefit).\nRevenue results are impacted by changes in sales volumes, which are summarized in the table below:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In thousands of MWh)\nDTE Electric Sales\nResidential\n4,733\n \n4,623 \n11,970\n \n11,774 \nCommercial\n4,480\n \n4,527 \n12,278\n \n12,452 \nIndustrial\n2,228\n \n2,255 \n6,332\n \n6,569 \nOther\n43\n \n44 \n138\n \n141 \n11,484\n \n11,449 \n30,718\n \n30,936 \nInterconnection sales\n2,783\n \n2,734 \n8,366\n \n6,162 \nTotal DTE Electric Sales\n14,267\n \n14,183 \n39,084\n \n37,098 \nDTE Electric Deliveries\nRetail and wholesale\n11,484\n \n11,449 \n30,718\n \n30,936 \nElectric retail access\n1,233\n \n1,183 \n3,453\n \n3,353 \nTotal DTE Electric Sales and Deliveries\n12,717\n \n12,632 \n34,171\n \n34,289 \nFuel and purchased power — utility\n expense increased $85 million and $143 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.

The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to higher benefits and other compensation expense of $11 million, higher plant generation expense of $8 million, and higher EWR expense of $5 million, partially offset by lower distribution operations expense of $10 million.  The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher benefits and other compensation of $22 million, higher EWR expense of $13 million, higher corporate support costs of $10 million, higher plant generation expense of $9 million and higher legal expense of $5 million, partially offset by one-time costs in 2024 of $32 million resulting from the voluntary separation incentive program and lower distribution  operations expense of $20 million.\nDepreciation and amortization\n expense increased $25 million and $77 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.  The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher depreciable base.\nTaxes other than income\n increased $11 million and $21 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.  The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher property taxes.\nAsset (gains) losses and impairments, net\n increased $47 million in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.  The increase in both periods was primarily due to an accrual of $47 million resulting from management's revisions to the timing and estimate of cash flows related to the decommissioning of Fermi 1.  Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" for additional information.\nOther (Income) and Deductions \nincreased $13 million and $33 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.  The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to higher net interest expense.  The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher net interest expense of $42 million partially offset by higher AFUDC equity of $11 million.\nIncome Tax Benefit\n decreased $87 million and $18 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.  The decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to higher earnings, lower production tax credits, and lower investment tax credits.  The decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher earnings.\nOutlook\n \n—\n DTE Electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity.  DTE Electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth.  DTE Electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while working to keep customer rate increases affordable.  Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding environmental compliance, and effects of energy waste reduction programs.\nDTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on April 24, 2025 requesting an increase in base rates of $574 million based on a projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2026, and an increase in return on equity from 9.9% to 10.75%.  The requested increase in base rates was primarily due to capital investments required to support continued reliability improvements and the ongoing transition to cleaner energy.  A final MPSC order in this case is expected in February 2026.\nIn October 2025, DTE Electric entered into a 1.4 gigawatt data center agreement.  Capital investments required to support this agreement are included in DTE Electric's 5-year capital investment plan in the \"Capital Investments\" section above.  DTE Electric is targeting regulatory approvals to be complete by year-end 2025.\n60\nTable of Contents\nGAS SEGMENT\nThe Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas.

The increase in both periods was primarily due to storm related property loss in the Renewables business of $3 million.\nOther (Income) and Deductions \ndecreased $4 million and $10 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.  The decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to lower equity earnings in the Renewables business of $7 million, partially offset by lower net interest expense of $3 million.  The decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to a prior year gain in the Renewables business of $25 million attributed to the sale of a partnership interest and higher interest expense of $2 million, partially offset by higher interest income of $11 million primarily associated with a new project in the On-site business and higher equity earnings of $6 million.\nIncome Taxes — Tax credits\n increased $18 million and $47 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.  The increase in the both periods was primarily due to higher estimated production tax credits in the Renewables business.\nOutlook —\n DTE Vantage will continue to leverage its extensive energy-related operating experience and project management capability to develop additional renewable natural gas projects and other projects that will provide customer specific energy solutions.  DTE Vantage is also developing decarbonization opportunities relating to carbon capture and sequestration projects.\n63\nTable of Contents\nENERGY TRADING SEGMENT\nEnergy Trading focuses on physical and financial power, natural gas and environmental marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions.  Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, environmental, and related services, which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers' behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers.  Energy Trading results and outlook are discussed below:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nOperating Revenues — Non-utility operations\n$\n1,179\n \n$\n840 \n$\n4,529\n \n$\n2,610 \nOperating Expenses\nPurchased power, gas, and other — non-utility\n1,109\n \n757 \n4,335\n \n2,425 \nOperation and maintenance\n24\n \n22 \n74\n \n69 \nDepreciation and amortization\n—\n \n2 \n3\n \n4 \nTaxes other than income\n—\n \n1 \n4\n \n4 \n1,133\n \n782 \n4,416\n \n2,502 \nOperating Income\n46\n \n58 \n113\n \n108 \nOther (Income) and Deductions\n2\n \n2 \n1\n \n(1)\nIncome Tax Expense\n11\n \n14 \n28\n \n27 \nNet Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company\n$\n33\n \n$\n42 \n$\n84\n \n$\n82 \nOperating Revenues — Non-utility operations \nincreased $339 million and $1,919 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.

The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher compensations costs.\nNatural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future and/or natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related non-derivative pipeline transportation contract.  These gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are marked-to-market without revaluing the related non-derivative contracts.\nOperating Income\n decreased $12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, which includes a $15 million favorable change in timing related gains primarily related to gas strategies that will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle.  The decrease also includes a $23 million unfavorable change in timing related gains and losses primarily related to gas strategies that were recognized in previous periods and reversed in the current period as the underlying contracts settled.\nOperating Income\n increased $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which includes a $79 million unfavorable change in timing related gains and losses primarily related to gas strategies that will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle.  The increase also includes a $56 million favorable change in timing related gains and losses primarily related to gas strategies that were recognized in previous periods and reversed in the current period as the underlying contracts settled.\nOutlook —\n In the near-term, Energy Trading expects market conditions to remain challenging.  The profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes, and changes in operating rules of Regional Transmission Organizations.  Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged.  Most financial instruments, physical power and natural gas contracts, and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas and environmental inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, storage assets, and some environmental contracts are not derivatives.  As a result, Energy Trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets.  Energy Trading's strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options.  This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods.\nSee also the \"Fair Value\" section herein and Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value\" and \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments,\" respectively.\nCORPORATE AND OTHER\nCorporate and Other includes various holding company activities, holds certain non-utility debt, and holds certain investments, including investments supporting regional development and economic growth.  The net loss of $115 million and $215 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, represents an increase of $93 million and $132 million from the net loss of $22 million and $83 million in the comparable 2024 periods.  The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to effective tax rate adjustments, higher net interest expense, and higher federal income taxes, including the $16 million impact from the One Big Beautiful Bill impact to the charitable contribution valuation allowance.  The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to effective tax rate adjustments, higher net interest expense, and higher federal and state income taxes, including the charitable contribution valuation allowance noted above, as well as the $14 million impact from the Illinois state tax law change in the second quarter.\n65\nTable of Contents\nOutlook —\n Corporate and Other will continue to support DTE Energy's goals to achieve long-term earnings growth by managing corporate costs such as interest and tax expense.  Corporate and Other will also continue to support DTE Energy in achieving a strong balance sheet, access to capital markets, and implementation of a financing plan that includes interest rate management in order to manage interest costs.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nCash Requirements\nDTE Energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities, to grow the non-utility businesses, to retire and pay interest on long-term debt, and to pay dividends.  DTE Energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements.  DTE Energy expects that cash from operations in 2025 will be approximately $3.3 billion.  DTE Energy anticipates base level utility capital investments, including environmental, renewable, and energy waste reduction expenditures, and expenditures for non-utility businesses of approximately $4.9 billion in 2025.  DTE Energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment.  Capital spending for growth of existing or new non-utility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict risk-return and value creation criteria.\nRefer below for analysis of cash flows relating to operating, investing, and financing activities, which reflect DTE Energy's change in financial condition.  Any significant non-cash items are included in the Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as applicable.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash at Beginning of Period\n$\n88\n \n$\n51 \nNet cash from operating activities\n2,361\n \n2,559 \nNet cash used for investing activities\n(3,683)\n(4,713)\nNet cash from financing activities\n1,313\n \n3,126 \nNet Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n(9)\n972 \nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash at End of Period\n$\n79\n \n$\n1,023 \nCash from Operating Activities\nA majority of DTE Energy's operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric retail access, regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions, changes in working capital, and operating costs.\nNet cash from operations decreased by $198 million in 2025.  The decrease was primarily due to decreases in cash related to working capital items, partially offset by an increase in cash related to Deferred income taxes and increases in Depreciation and amortization and Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net.\nThe change in working capital items in 2025 was primarily due to decreases in cash related to Regulatory assets and liabilities and Other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, partially offset by increases in cash related to Accounts receivable, net and Accrued pension liability.\nCash used for Investing Activities\nCash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions.  In any given year, DTE Energy looks to realize cash from under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured, fully valued assets.\nCapital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy goals.\n66\nTable of Contents\nCapital spending within the non-utility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance, expansion, and growth.  DTE Energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks, and returns.  All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis.  DTE Energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria.  For new business lines, DTE Energy initially invests based on research and analysis.  DTE Energy starts with a limited investment, evaluates the results, and either expands or exits the business based on those results.  In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of DTE Energy, with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings.\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased by $1.0 billion in 2025 primarily due to decreases in utility plant and equipment expenditures, Notes receivable, and the Investment in time deposits in 2024, partially offset by the Acquisition related to business combination, net of cash acquired.\nCash from Financing Activities\nDTE Energy relies on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations.\nDTE Energy's strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity.  DTE Energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating.\nNet cash from financing activities decreased by $1.8 billion in 2025 primarily due to decreases in cash related to lower Issuance of long-term debt, net of discount and issuance costs, higher Redemption of long-term debt, and higher cash used for the repayment of Short-term borrowings, net.\nOutlook\nSources of Cash\nDTE Energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the long-term, primarily as a result of growth from the utility and non-utility businesses.  Growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending which will increase the base from which rates are determined.  Further, the Inflation Reduction Act allows for extended tax benefits for renewable technologies, increased rates for PTCs and an option to claim PTCs for solar projects, expanded qualified ITC facilities to include standalone energy storage, and allows for the transfer of tax credits generated from renewable projects.  DTE Electric expects to continue to monetize these tax credits to generate cash flows in the near-term.  DTE Energy expects long-term growth in sales related to vehicle electrification, but no significant impacts in the near-term.  Non-utility growth is expected from additional investments in the DTE Vantage segment, primarily related to renewable energy and custom energy solutions, while expanding into carbon capture and sequestration.  DTE Vantage also expects enhanced growth opportunities in decarbonization as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for renewable natural gas and carbon capture projects.\nDTE Energy's utilities may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms, as a result of timing of MPSC orders.  Energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.  DTE Energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of long-term capital projects.\nAt the discretion of management and depending upon economic and financial market conditions, DTE Energy expects to issue up to $100 million of equity in 2025.  DTE Energy anticipates these discretionary equity issuances to be made through contributions to the dividend reinvestment plan and/or employee benefit plans.\nOver the long-term, additional equity issuances of $500 million to $600 million will be needed beginning in 2026 through 2028 to support long-term growth.  DTE Energy will continue to evaluate equity needs on an annual basis.  DTE Energy currently expects its primary source of long-term financing to be the issuance of debt and is monitoring changes in interest rates and impacts on the cost of borrowing.\nUses of Cash\nDTE Energy has $326 million in long-term debt, including securitization bonds and finance leases, maturing within twelve months.  Repayment of the debt is expected to be made through internally generated funds, the issuance of short-term and/or long-term debt.\n67\nTable of Contents\nDTE Energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for more than 100 consecutive years and expects to continue paying regular cash dividends in the future, including approximately $0.9 billion in 2025.  Any payment of future dividends is subject to approval by the Board of Directors and may depend on DTE Energy's future earnings, capital requirements, and financial condition.  Over the long-term, DTE Energy expects continued dividend growth and is targeting a payout ratio consistent with pure-play utility companies.\nVarious subsidiaries and equity investees of DTE Energy have entered into derivative and non-derivative contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy.  These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy's credit rating is downgraded below investment grade.  Certain of these provisions (known as \"hard triggers\") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as \"soft triggers\") are not as specific.  For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post.  The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and environmental) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions.  As of September 30, 2025, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was $342 million.\nOther obligations are further described in the following Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\nNote\nTitle\n1\nOrganization and Basis of Presentation\n2\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n6\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n10\nFinancial and Other Derivative Instruments\n11\nLong-Term Debt\n12\nShort-Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings\n14\nCommitments and Contingencies\n15\nRetirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets\nAlso refer to the \"Capital Investments\" section above regarding DTE Energy's capital strategy and estimated spend over the next five years.  For additional information regarding DTE Energy's future cash obligations, including scheduled debt maturities and interest payments, minimum lease payments, and future purchase commitments, refer to DTE Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nLiquidity\nDTE Energy has approximately $2.6 billion of available liquidity at September 30, 2025, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements.\nDTE Energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs.  However, virtually all of DTE Energy's businesses are capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"New Accounting Pronouncements.\"\n68\nTable of Contents\nFAIR VALUE\nDerivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative assets or liabilities.  Contracts DTE Energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power, natural gas, some environmental contracts, and certain forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts.  Items DTE Energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas and environmental inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, storage assets, and some environmental contracts.  See Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value\" and \"Financial and Other Derivative Instruments,\" respectively.\nThe tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of non-derivative natural gas storage, transportation, certain power contracts, and some environmental contracts which are subject to accrual accounting.  Consequently, gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in volatility in the Registrants' reported period-by-period earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery and/or settlement.\nThe Registrants manage their MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract.  Accordingly, the Registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year).\nThe Registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  For further discussion of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Fair Value.\"\nThe following table provides details on changes in DTE Energy's MTM net asset (or liability) position:\nDTE Energy\n(In millions)\nMTM at December 31, 2024\n$\n72 \nReclassified to realized upon settlement\n(247)\nChanges in fair value recorded to income\n247 \nAmounts recorded to unrealized income\n— \nChanges in fair value recorded in Regulatory liabilities\n20 \nAmounts recorded in other comprehensive income, pre-tax\n(20)\nChange in collateral\n(18)\nPurchases\n15 \nMTM at September 30, 2025\n$\n69\n \nThe table below shows the maturity of DTE Energy's MTM positions.
