We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nReferences in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to “AMD,” “we,” “us,” “management,” “our” or the “Company” mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.\nAMD, the AMD Arrow logo, AMD Instinct, EPYC, Radeon, Ryzen, Xilinx and combinations thereof are trademarks of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Other names are for informational purposes only and are used to identify companies and products and may be trademarks of their respective owners. “Zen” is a codename for an AMD architecture and is not a product name.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and for each of the three years for the period ended December 28, 2024 as filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOverview and Recent Developments \nWe are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: \n•\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, microprocessors (CPUs) for servers, graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers;\n•\nCPUs, APUs, chipsets for desktops and notebooks, discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services; and\n•\nembedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products.\nFrom time to time, we may also sell or license portions of our intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “we”, “us,” “our”, “AMD” or the “Company”), including a discussion of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 compared to the prior year period and an analysis of changes in our financial condition\n.\nNet revenue for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was $9.2 billion, a 36% increase compared to the prior year period. The increase in net revenue was driven by an increase in Client and Gaming segment revenue, primarily driven by strong demand for our AMD Ryzen™ processors, semi-custom game console SoCs and Radeon™ gaming GPUs; and an increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily driven by strong demand for our 5th generation AMD EPYC™ processors and AMD Instinct™ MI350 Series GPUs. Embedded segment revenue decreased as certain end market demand remained mixed. \nGross margin for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was 52% compared to gross margin of 50% for the prior year period, a 2% increase primarily driven by product mix.\nOperating income for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $724 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating income was due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net income for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was $1.2 billion compared to net income of $771 million for the prior year period. The increase in net income was primarily driven by higher operating income. \nAs of September 27, 2025, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $7.2 billion compared to $5.1 billion as of December 28, 2024. During the nine months ended September 27, 2025\n, \nwe generated $5.1 billion of cash from operating activities and we returned $1.3 billion to stockholders through the repurchase of common stock under our Repurchase Program. \nOn March 31, 2025 (the Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of ZT Group Int’l, Inc. (ZT Systems), which is expected to enable AMD to deliver end-to-end AI solutions and accelerate the design and deployment of AMD-powered AI infrastructure at scale optimized for the cloud. On the Acquisition Date, we paid $3.2 billion in cash and issued 8,335,849 shares of our common stock. ZT Systems is comprised of the data center infrastructure manufacturing business (ZT Manufacturing Business), which was classified as held for sale, and the design operations (ZT Design Business). \nOn October 27, 2025, we completed the sale of the ZT Manufacturing Business to Sanmina Corporation (Sanmina) for 1,151,052 shares of Sanmina common stock and $2.4 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, as closing consideration. We are eligible to receive additional cash consideration of up to $450 million to the extent certain conditions are met following the close of the sale. \nOn October 30, 2025, we settled the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of ZT Systems of $300 million in cash and 740,961 shares of the Company’s common stock with the former ZT Systems stockholders and warrant holders. \n25\nTable of Contents\nOn October 5, 2025, the Company issued to OpenAI OpCo, LLC (the Warrantholder) a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 160 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The warrant shares will vest in tranches based on certain GPU purchase milestones by the Warrantholder, or its affiliates, or indirectly through third parties, and achievement of specified Company stock price targets and stock performance. Each vested tranche is further subject to the fulfillment of certain other technical and commercial conditions prior to exercise. Subject to certain conditions, the warrant is exercisable through October 5, 2030.\nIn April 2025, new U.S. export restrictions on certain semiconductors to China led to approximately $800 million in product inventory and related charges on AMD Instinct MI308 Data Center GPU products during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. We applied for and were granted some licenses by the U.S. government that allow us to ship MI308 products to certain China-based customers. We did not record MI308 China-based customer revenue during the three months ended September 27, 2025. Sales of our MI308 products into China depend on customer demand, China’s import control rules and our ability to obtain licenses. \nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, business combination accounting and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nOther than the estimates used in accounting for business combinations, management believes there have been no significant changes for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024.\nBusiness Combinations.\n We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to assets and liabilities held for sale, intangible assets and contingent consideration. Significant estimates and inputs used in valuing acquired assets and liabilities held for sale, developed technology, and other identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue, future changes in technology, useful lives, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. \nResults of Continuing Operations \nBeginning with the fiscal year ending December 27, 2025, we combined the Client and Gaming segments into one reportable segment to align with how we manage our business. Neither of the Client and Gaming businesses qualify as a separate reportable operating segment, however, we continue to separately disclose revenues for each business. All prior period segment data were retrospectively adjusted. \nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact this trend.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\n(In millions)\nNet revenue:\nData Center\n$\n4,341 \n$\n3,549 \n$\n11,255 \n$\n8,720 \nClient and Gaming\nClient\n$\n2,750 \n$\n1,881 \n$\n7,543 \n$\n4,741 \nGaming\n1,298 \n462 \n3,067 \n2,032 \nTotal Client and Gaming\n4,048 \n2,343 \n10,610 \n6,773 \nEmbedded\n857 \n927 \n2,504 \n2,634 \nTotal net revenue\n$\n9,246 \n$\n6,819 \n$\n24,369 \n$\n18,127 \nCost of sales and operating expenses:\nData Center\n$\n3,267 \n$\n2,508 \n$\n9,404 \n$\n6,395 \nClient and Gaming\n3,181 \n2,055 \n8,480 \n6,082 \nEmbedded\n574 \n555 \n1,618 \n1,575 \nAll other\n954 \n977 \n2,925 \n3,046 \nTotal cost of sales and operating expenses\n$\n7,976 \n$\n6,095 \n$\n22,427 \n$\n17,098 \nOperating income (loss):\nData Center\n$\n1,074 \n$\n1,041 \n$\n1,851 \n$\n2,325 \nClient and Gaming\n867 \n288 \n2,130 \n691 \nEmbedded\n283 \n372 \n886 \n1,059 \nAll other\n(954)\n(977)\n(2,925)\n(3,046)\nTotal operating income\n$\n1,270 \n$\n724 \n$\n1,942 \n$\n1,029 \nData Center\nData Center net revenue of $4.3 billion for the three months ended September 27, 2025 increased by 22%, compared to net revenue of $3.5 billion for the prior year period. Data Center net revenue of $11.3 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 increased by 29%, compared to net revenue of $8.7 billion for the prior year period. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by strong demand for our 5th generation AMD EPYC™ processors and AMD Instinct™ MI350 Series GPUs.\nData Center operating income was $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 27, 2025, compared to operating income of $1.0 billion for the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nData Center operating income was $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to operating income of $2.3 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to approximately $800 million of inventory and related charges associated with the U.S. government export control on AMD Instinct MI308 GPU product and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue.\nClient and Gaming\nClient and Gaming net revenue of $4.0 billion for the three months ended September 27, 2025 increased by 73%, compared to net revenue of $2.3 billion for the prior year period. Client and Gaming net revenue of $10.6 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 increased by 57%, compared to net revenue of $6.8 billion for the prior year period.  \n27\nTable of Contents\nClient revenue for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was $2.8 billion, up 46% from the prior year period, primarily driven by a 38% increase in average selling price, and a 4% increase in unit shipments of AMD Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. Client revenue for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 was $7.5 billion, up 59% from the prior year period, primarily driven by a 41% increase in average selling price and a 13% increase in unit shipments of AMD Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. \nGaming revenue for the three months ended September 27, 2025 was $1.3 billion, up 181% from the prior year period. Gaming revenue for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 was $3.1 billion, up 51% from the prior year period. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by higher semi-custom revenue and strong demand of our Radeon gaming GPUs. \nClient and Gaming operating income was $867 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025, compared to operating income of $288 million for the prior year period. Client and Gaming operating income was $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to operating income of $691 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. \nEmbedded\nEmbedded net revenue of $857 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025 decreased by 8%, compared to net revenue of $927 million for the prior year period. Embedded net revenue of $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 decreased by 5%, compared to net revenue of $2.6 billion for the prior year period. Net revenue decreased in both periods as certain end market demand remained mixed. \nEmbedded operating income was $283 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025, compared to operating income of $372 million for the prior year period. Embedded operating income was $886 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2025, compared to operating income of $1.1 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in operating income in both periods was primarily due to lower revenue.\nAll Other\nAll Other operating loss of $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 27, 2025 primarily consisted of $562 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $419 million of stock-based compensation expense. All Other operating loss of $977 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 primarily consisted of $585 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $351 million of stock-based compensation expense. \nAll Other operating loss of $2.9 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 primarily consisted of $1.7 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $1.2 billion of stock-based compensation expense. All Other operating loss of $3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 primarily consisted of $1.8 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $1.1 billion of stock-based compensation expense.\nInternational Sales\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 64% and 72% for the three months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 67% and 65% for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.\n28\nTable of Contents\nGross Margin and Expenses\nThe following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated:\n \n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\n \nIn millions, except percentages\nNet revenue\n$\n9,246 \n$\n6,819 \n$\n24,369 \n$\n18,127 \nCost of sales\n4,206 \n3,167 \n12,023 \n8,590 \nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n260 \n233 \n771 \n694 \nGross profit\n4,780 \n3,419 \n11,575 \n8,843 \nGross margin\n52\n%\n50\n%\n47\n%\n49\n%\nResearch and development\n2,139 \n1,636 \n5,761 \n4,744 \nMarketing, general and administrative\n1,069 \n707 \n2,946 \n1,954 \nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n302 \n352 \n926 \n1,116 \nInterest expense\n(37)\n(23)\n(95)\n(73)\nOther income (expense), net\n82 \n36 \n219 \n144 \nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n153 \n(27)\n(558)\n(38)\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\n71 \n— \n175 \n— \nGross Margin\nGross margin was 52% and 50% for the three months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively, an increase of 2% primarily driven by product mix.\nGross margin was 47% and 49% for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to approximately $800 million of inventory and related charges associated with the U.S. government export control on AMD Instinct MI308 Data Center GPU product, partially offset by a richer mix of Ryzen processor sales.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses of $2.1 billion for the three months ended September 27, 2025 increased by $503 million, or 31%, compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period. Research and development expenses of $5.8 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 increased by $1.0 billion, or 21%, compared to $4.7 billion for the prior year period. The increase in both periods was due to higher employee-related costs from an increase in headcount in support of our continued focus on our AI strategy. \nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 27, 2025 increased by $362 million, or 51%, compared to $707 million for the prior year period. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.9 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 increased by $1.0 billion, or 51%, compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period. The increase in both periods was primarily due to an increase in go‑to‑market activities to support our revenue growth.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $562 million for the three months ended September 27, 2025 decreased by $23 million, or 4%, compared to $585 million for the prior year period. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 decreased by $113 million, or 6%, compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles that were fully amortized in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets from current fiscal year acquisitions.\n29\nTable of Contents\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 was $37 million\n \nand\n \n$95 million, respectively. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was $23 million\n \nand\n \n$73 million, respectively. The increase in both periods was due to the issuance of $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.212% Notes and 4.319% Notes on March 24, 2025.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. \nOther income (expense), net for three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 was $82 million and $219 million, respectively. Other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was $36 million and $144 million, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to unrealized gains and dividends received from investments in nonmarketable securities of privately held companies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine income taxes for interim reporting periods by applying our estimated annual effective tax rate to the year-to-date results and adjusted for tax items discrete to each period. \nFor the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025, we recorded an income tax provision of $153 million and an income tax benefit of $558 million representing an effective tax rate from continuing operations of 11.5% and (26.7)%, respectively. The tax provision (benefit) for both periods reflected the income tax benefit from foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and research and development (R&D) tax credits, partially offset by the tax rate detriment from foreign earnings, as well as a discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. In addition, the tax benefit for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 also included a discrete tax benefit of $853 million related to the release of uncertain tax positions pertaining to the reasonable cause relief for dual consolidated losses approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in April 2025.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of $27 million and $38 million representing an effective tax rate of (3.6)% and (3.3)%, respectively. The tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 reflected discrete tax benefits primarily related to tax effects of stock-based compensation partially offset by the interest and penalties accrued for uncertain tax positions.\nIn July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was enacted into law. For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025, the primary impact of the OBBBA to our tax provision was the accelerated expensing of domestic R&D activities which decreased our estimated income eligible for FDII resulting in a higher estimated annual effective tax rate. The OBBBA is also expected to reduce our deferred tax assets and our current income tax liability for fiscal year 2025. Other OBBBA changes did not have a material impact on the financial statements.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nNet income from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 of $71 million and $175 million, respectively, include the results of operations of the ZT Manufacturing Business, partially offset by increases of $17 million and $52 million, respectively, in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of ZT Systems. \nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n    \nAs of September 27, 2025 and December 28, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $7.2 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. \n30\nTable of Contents\nOur operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2025 compared to the prior year period are as described below:\n \nNine Months Ended\n \nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\n \n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nNet cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations\n$\n4,189 \n$\n1,742 \nNet cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations\n920 \n— \nOperating activities\n5,109 \n1,742 \nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities of continuing operations\n(3,962)\n113 \nNet cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations\n(30)\n— \nInvesting activities\n(3,992)\n113 \nFinancing activities of continuing operations\n(103)\n(1,891)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n1,014 \n$\n(36)\nOn March 31, 2025, we paid $3.2 billion in cash and issued 8,335,849 shares of our common stock to close the acquisition of ZT Systems. \nAs of September 27, 2025, our principal short-term and long-term debt obligations were $873 million and $2.3 billion, respectively. \nWe may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum principal amount outstanding, at any time, of $3.0 billion, with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. During the three months ended March 29, 2025, we issued $950 million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper which was subsequently repaid before June 28, 2025. As of September 27, 2025, we had no commercial paper outstanding. \nWe have $3.0 billion available under an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on April 29, 2027. No funds were drawn from this credit facility during the three months ended September 27, 2025. \nAs of September 27, 2025, we had commitments of approximately $12.1 billion, of which $3.8 billion are for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. We work continually with our suppliers and partners on the timing of payments and deliveries of commitments, taking into account business conditions.\nWe believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, commitments and strategic activities over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nOperating Activities\nOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations are primarily cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures. \nNet cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $4.2 billion in the nine months ended September 27, 2025, primarily due to our net income of $2.8 billion, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $2.5 billion and net cash outflows of $992 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
