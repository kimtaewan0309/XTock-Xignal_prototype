BUSINESS\nGeneral\nAs a global airline based in the United States, we connect customers across our expansive global network with a commitment to ensuring that the future of travel is connected, personalized and enjoyable. In 2024, we served over 200 million customers safely, reliably and with industry-leading customer service innovation. \nCompetitive Advantages and Brand Strength\nIn 2024, we continued to differentiate Delta from the industry and to invest in the durability of our competitive advantages. These enduring competitive advantages that support our trusted consumer brand include our people and culture, operational reliability, global network, customer loyalty and financial foundation.\nPeople and Culture\nThe Delta people and culture are our strongest competitive advantage. Our more than 100,000 employees provide world-class travel experiences for our customers and best-in-class service. We believe that Delta's brand transcends the industry, powered by our people's outstanding work and passion for serving our customers. In 2024, Delta was recognized as the world's No. 11 Most Admired Company as ranked by \nFORTUNE\n, and was ranked No. 13 in the U.S. on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work list.\nOur industry-leading profit sharing program directly aligns our employees' interests with the company's long-term success and for 2024, we are rewarding them with $1.4 billion in profit sharing payments. The company also maintains a Shared Rewards program to incentivize operational performance, and our employees earned $86 million under this program in 2024.\nOperational Reliability\nWe remain committed to industry-leading reliability as the foundation for our brand promise and efficiency. We are consistently among the industry's best performers, delivering the best on-time arrival and completion factor among our network carrier peers in 2024. In recognition of our unwavering commitment to operational performance, we were honored for the fourth consecutive year with the Cirium Platinum Award for global operational excellence in January 2025 and named the most on-time airline in North America. The \nWall Street Journal\n named us the top airline of 2024 among the nine major U.S. airlines in its annual airline scorecard for the fourth consecutive year, leading the industry in on-time arrivals and fewest involuntary denied boardings.\nGlobal Network\nWe and our alliance partners collectively serve over 120 countries and territories and over 800 destinations around the world. At the end of 2024, we offered up to 5,000 peak-day flights to more than 290 destinations on six continents.\nOur domestic network is centered around core hubs in Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Salt Lake City. Core hubs have strong local passenger share, a high penetration of customers loyal to Delta, a competitive cost position and strong margins. Core hub positions complement coastal hub positions in Boston, Los Angeles, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK and Seattle. Coastal hubs provide a strong presence in large revenue markets and enable growth in premium products and international service.\nIn 2024, we focused on increasing flights at our core hubs while improving the efficiency of our operations in our coastal hubs. We continue to leverage our coastal gateways and strategic relationships with international airline partners to further expand our international service.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n2\nItem 1. Business\nInternationally, we seek to bring more choice to customers through innovative alliances with Aeroméxico, Air France-KLM, China Eastern, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (\"LATAM\"), Korean Air and Virgin Atlantic. We operate significant hubs in, or have market presence in the key cities of, Amsterdam, Bogota, Lima, London-Heathrow, Mexico City, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Santiago (Chile), Sao Paulo, Seoul-Incheon and Tokyo. Our strategic relationships with international airlines are an important part of our business as they improve our access to markets around the world and enable us to provide customers a more seamless global travel experience across our alliance network. The most significant of these arrangements are commercial joint ventures or cooperation agreements that include joint sales and marketing coordination, co-location of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements. In some cases, we have reinforced strategic alliances through equity investments where we have the opportunity to create deep relationships and maximize commercial cooperation.\nOur global network is supported by a fleet of 1,292 aircraft as of December 31, 2024 that are varied in size and capabilities, giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network. We are continuing to refresh our fleet by acquiring new and more fuel-efficient aircraft with increased premium seating and cargo capacity to replace retiring aircraft, while modifying our existing aircraft cabins to increase premium offerings and harmonize interiors. Simultaneously, we continue on our multi-year journey of fleet simplification by replacing retiring aircraft with deliveries of next-generation aircraft. In 2024, we took delivery of 38 aircraft, including A321neos, A220-300s, A330-900s and A350-900 aircraft. \nCustomer Loyalty\nWith operational excellence, best-in-class service and commitment to our customers, we have continued to earn our customers' trust and preference by delivering the \"Delta Difference.\" We continue to invest in elevated customer experiences through generational airport investments, including new Delta One Lounges and Delta Sky Clubs in key markets, and innovative technology initiatives such as Delta Sync to deliver seamless, personalized experiences at scale. We believe our continued investment in customer service and experience, operations, product, airports and technology has shaped customer perception of our brand leading to improvements in our domestic net promoter scores and increased customer loyalty. In 2024, various outlets recognized Delta as a trusted consumer brand, including:\n•\nRecognized as the 2024 Airline of the Year by aviation publication \nAir Transport World\n.\n•\nNamed Best U.S. Airline and topped five categories in the \nForbes Travel Guide’s\n Luxury Air Travel Awards.\n•\nNamed the number one airline by corporate travel customers in the annual Business Travel News Airline Survey for the 14\nth\n year in a row and the number one U.S. airline by \nCondé Nast Traveler\n readers.\n•\nEarned the number one spot on The Points Guy's list of best U.S. Airlines for the sixth year in a row.\nOur award-winning SkyMiles program, discussed in further detail below, is designed to attract lifetime members and to grow customer loyalty by offering our customers a wide variety of benefits when traveling with us and our partners, and personalizing our engagement with them. We aim to increase the value of our program and to deepen customer engagement with Delta through a growing ecosystem of partnerships with premier brands and travel-adjacent experiences, extending the value of our SkyMiles currency beyond flight. We expect the increased value we provide customers to deliver high-margin revenue and resilient cash flows.\nFinancial Foundation\nOver the past 15 years of consistent strategy, investment and execution, we have fundamentally transformed our business by investing in our people, our product and our reliability to alter the commodity-like nature of air travel and improve our financial foundation. We strive to continue achieving differentiated performance by delivering sustained value creation through margin expansion, durable earnings and free cash flow, and balance sheet strength.\nRestoring the strength of our balance sheet and reducing debt remains a key financial priority. During 2024, we made approximately $4.0 billion in payments on debt and finance lease obligations. Recognizing our continued progression on debt reduction and improving financial results, we regained our investment grade rating from all three major rating agencies, marking a key financial milestone for Delta.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n3\nItem 1. Business\nWe have diversified our business by growing high-margin revenue streams that leverage our competitive advantages, including:\n•\nOur continued focus on our premium products (including Delta One\n®\n, First Class, Delta Premium Select and Delta Comfort+\n®\n) and customer segmentation, which has reduced our reliance on the most price sensitive customer segment.\n•\nOur partnership with American Express, which provides us a co-brand revenue stream tied to broader consumer spending.\n•\nOur Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (\"MRO\") operation, where we are well-positioned for growth through contractual agreements with jet engine manufacturers, including three next-generation engine platforms.\n•\nOur other complementary portfolio businesses, such as our cargo operations and Delta Vacations.\nOur premium yield growth has significantly outpaced main cabin, with record paid load factors in premium cabin in 2024, as demand for premium products continues to grow. In 2024, we introduced aircraft with more premium seating and completed cabin modification programs to increase premium offerings. \nSkyMiles Program\nOur SkyMiles program provides members with the ability to earn mileage credits (\"miles\") when traveling on Delta, Delta Connection and our partner airlines. Miles may also be earned by using certain services offered by program partners, such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies. To facilitate transactions with participating companies, we sell miles to non-airline businesses and other airlines.\nMiles may be used toward award redemptions such as flights and upgrades on Delta, our regional carriers and other participating airlines as well as donations to specific charities and more. In 2024, 10% of revenue miles flown on Delta were from award travel, as program members redeemed miles in the loyalty program for approximately 30 million award tickets. Our most significant and valuable contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. In 2024, remuneration from American Express totaled $7.4 billion, which we expect to grow to $10 billion over the long-term.\nInnovative Investments in Technology\nOur objective is to make technology a strategic differentiator. We continue to invest in technological improvements that enhance the customer experience, support our operations and empower our people. These investments include innovations to customer facing applications and improvements to infrastructure and technology architecture to unify and improve access to data sources. We believe this digital transformation enhances interactions with our customers and allows our people to deliver more personalized service, further enhancing the customer experience, strengthening our brand and driving revenue and efficiency.\nThrough the development of innovative new technologies, we provide our employees with greater tools to allow them to have more meaningful interactions with our customers and to serve them better. For our customers, we are making investments in the digital platforms on the ground and in the air. We continue to evolve the Fly Delta app into a digital travel concierge for our customers to offer convenient services on the day of travel and deliver thoughtful notifications to make their travel journeys more seamless. On the ground, we are investing to create a smoother and less stressful travel experience. Onboard the aircraft, we continue to invest in our in-flight entertainment and are expanding fast and free Wi-Fi for all customers through a free SkyMiles account, which is now on most domestic mainline flights with plans for full availability on international and regional aircraft. We also continue to innovate and enhance Delta Sync, which will enable the creation of more personalized experiences over the next several years. We continue to elevate the consumer experience across the travel journey and beyond, including through partnerships with leading brands, to broaden the Delta SkyMiles ecosystem and the range of benefits we provide to our members.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n4\nItem 1. Business\nCommercial Arrangements with Other Airlines\nJoint Venture/Cooperation Agreements. \nWe have implemented four separate joint venture or joint cooperation agreements with foreign carriers as described below. We have sought to reinforce these agreements through equity investments in those carriers. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our equity investments. \nEach of our joint venture or cooperation arrangements provides for joint commercial cooperation with the relevant partner within the geographic scope of the arrangement, including the sharing of revenues and/or profits and losses generated by the parties on the joint venture routes, as well as joint marketing and sales, coordinated pricing and revenue management, network and schedule planning and other coordinated activities with respect to the parties' operations on joint venture routes. Our implemented commercial joint ventures/cooperation agreements consist of the following:\n•\nA combined joint venture with Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic with respect to transatlantic traffic flows. In addition to the joint venture, we own a non-controlling 49% equity stake in Virgin Atlantic Limited, the parent company of Virgin Atlantic Airways, and a 3% ownership stake in the parent company of Air France and KLM.\n•\nA joint cooperation agreement with Aeroméxico with respect to trans-border traffic flows between the U.S. and Mexico. In addition to the joint cooperation agreement, we currently own an approximately 20% equity stake in Grupo Aeroméxico, S.A.B. de C.V., the parent company of Aeroméxico.\n•\nA joint venture agreement with LATAM with respect to traffic flows between North and South America, allowing our passengers to access more than 300 destinations between the United States/Canada and Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. We currently own an approximately 10% equity stake in LATAM.\n•\nA joint venture with Korean Air with respect to traffic flows between the United States and certain countries in Asia. In addition to the joint venture, we own just under 15% of the outstanding common stock of Hanjin-KAL, the largest shareholder of Korean Air.\nEach of our joint venture or joint cooperation agreements described above has been approved and granted antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"). The grant of antitrust immunity for our joint cooperation agreement with Aeroméxico is subject to a pending renewal application with the DOT, which was tentatively dismissed pursuant to an Order to Show Cause issued by the DOT on January 26, 2024. The existing immunity remains in effect pending final adjudication of the renewal application, the timing and outcome of which cannot be predicted at this time.\nEnhanced Commercial Agreements with China Eastern. \nWe own a 2% equity interest in China Eastern, with whom we have a strategic joint marketing and commercial cooperation arrangement covering traffic flows between China and the U.S., which includes reciprocal codesharing, loyalty program participation, airport lounge access and joint sales cooperation. \nSkyTeam\n. We are a member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. The other members of SkyTeam are Aerolíneas Argentinas, Aeroméxico, Air Europa (Spain), Air France, China Airlines, China Eastern, Garuda Indonesia, ITA Airways (formerly Alitalia), Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Middle East Airlines, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Saudia, TAROM (Romania), Vietnam Airlines, Virgin Atlantic and Xiamen Airlines (China). Through alliance arrangements with other SkyTeam carriers, we are able to link our route network with those of the other member airlines, providing opportunities to increase connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through reciprocal codesharing and loyalty program participation, airport lounge access and cargo operations.\nOther International Carriers\n. We also have marketing arrangements with other airlines to enhance our global network. These arrangements may include codesharing, reciprocal loyalty program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges, joint promotions, common use of airport gates and ticket counters, office co-location and other activities.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n5\nItem 1. Business\nRegional Carriers\nWe have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our network by serving passengers primarily in small and medium-sized cities in the domestic market. These arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets. \nThrough our regional carrier program, Delta Connection\n®\n, we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate aircraft using our \"DL\" designator code. We currently have contractual arrangements with:\n•\nEndeavor Air, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours (\"Endeavor\").\n•\nRepublic Airways, Inc.\n•\nSkyWest Airlines, Inc. (\"SkyWest Airlines\").\nOur contractual agreements with regional carriers are primarily capacity purchase arrangements, under which we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers' flights operating under our \"DL\" designator code. We are entitled to all ticket, cargo, mail, in-flight and ancillary revenues associated with the flights under these capacity purchase arrangements. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. These capacity purchase agreements are long-term agreements, usually with initial terms of at least ten years, which grant us the option to extend the initial term. Certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement, or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement, for convenience at certain future dates.\nSkyWest Airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement. This proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries.\nCargo\nThrough our global network, our cargo operations are able to connect the world’s major freight gateways. We generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft. We are a member of SkyTeam Cargo, an international airline cargo alliance with eight other airlines that offer a network spanning six continents, through which we provide global solutions to our customers by connecting our network with those partners. In 2024, cargo revenues were approximately $822 million.\nOther Complementary Businesses\nWe have various other businesses arising from our airline operations, including the following:\n•\nIn addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of 1,292 mainline and regional aircraft, our MRO operation, known as Delta TechOps, serves aviation and airline customers from around the world. With agreements to service multiple next-generation aircraft engines, Delta TechOps is positioned as a leading global service provider for state-of-the-art, more sustainable engines.\n•\nOur vacation package subsidiary, Delta Vacations, provides elevated, all-in-one, customized and flexible vacation experiences designed for members of our SkyMiles program. Revenue allocated to Delta Vacations excludes flight revenue associated with vacation packages.\nIn 2024, the aggregate revenue from our MRO operation and Delta Vacations was approximately $770 million.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n6\nItem 1. Business\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nWe are pursuing a long-term strategy to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from our airline operations by 2050, with initiatives focused around three key themes: What We Fly, How We Fly, and the Fuel We Use. Throughout 2024, we continued to prioritize innovative measures to reduce emissions and other environmental impacts across our business.\nWhat We Fly\n•\nFleet renewal and optimization\n: We continue to make our existing fleet more efficient as older aircraft are retired. Additions to our fleet since 2019, including 38 aircraft delivered in 2024, are on average 28% more fuel efficient per seat mile than aircraft retired since 2019. In addition to accepting deliveries of next-generation fleet types, we have also invested in retrofitting our existing fleet with updated technologies that optimize and reduce fuel consumption. Following the installation of split-scimitar winglets on our Boeing 737-900ER fleet in 2021, we expect to complete similar modifications on the Boeing 737-800 fleet by the end of 2025, an enhancement expected to drive over three million gallons of fuel savings annually. Cumulatively, fleet renewal and optimization efforts have led to a 6.6% improvement in fleet-wide fuel efficiency since 2019.\n•\nPursuing future aviation technologies\n: Our sustainability strategy aims to introduce revolutionary aircraft into our fleet. In 2024, we joined a collaborative project between Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Airbus and Plug Power to assess the feasibility of hydrogen fueling at the world's busiest airport. This innovative project supplements previously announced partnerships with Boeing and NASA on their Sustainable Flight Demonstrator program, also known as the X-66, as well as our investment in Joby Aviation, which aims to pioneer home-to-airport transportation through electric, vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology.\nHow We Fly\n•\nAircraft operations:\n We achieved fuel savings through initiatives like enhanced routing and landing procedures, reductions to catering service weight and use of new engine cleaning technologies. In 2024, these fuel efficiency efforts allowed us to save approximately 44 million gallons of jet fuel in comparison to fuel consumption in 2019, based on our projected fuel usage had we not undertaken these initiatives.\n•\nPlastic waste reduction\n: In late 2024, we began using a new paper cup on board international flights with plans to expand use across all domestic flights in the first half of 2025. Once fully implemented, the new paper cup will help eliminate nearly seven million pounds of single-use plastic on board annually.\n•\nGround operations\n: We continue to work with airport partners to drive fuel savings by limiting the use of aircraft Auxiliary Power Units (“APUs”) during ground operations. In 2024, we installed 30 new preconditioned air units at our Detroit and Minneapolis hubs, which serve as electric alternatives to APUs and do not require jet fuel. \nThe Fuel We Use\n•\nContinued investment in sustainable aviation fuel (\"SAF\")\n: With approximately 90% of our carbon emissions coming from jet fuel, finding lower emissions fuel alternatives is critical to making progress toward net zero. SAF, which can be channeled to airports through existing fuel infrastructure, is central to reducing the lifecycle emissions from aviation fuel and is safe to use in current aircraft engines. However, SAF is currently produced in small quantities that do not meet the industry's growing demand and remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Because SAF is not being produced at the scale needed, we continue to catalyze investment and stimulate SAF production by signing offtake agreements with various SAF producers. Under these agreements, we have contracted to purchase SAF when it is available, subject to certain conditions. In 2024, we used over 14 million gallons of SAF onboard our aircraft, a small fraction of our overall fuel consumption but more than four times our 2023 SAF utilization.\n•\nBuilding coalitions for the future\n: We are a founding member of the Minnesota SAF Hub, a first-of-its-kind partnership among corporations seeking to collaborate on scaling SAF production. Our work with the Minnesota SAF Hub reached a key milestone in 2024, announcing the development of the first SAF blending facility in Minnesota, a collaboration between Delta and Flint Hills Resources, which is expected to blend up to 30 million gallons of SAF annually once fully operational. We continue to advocate for policy incentives to scale the SAF market, including as a founding member of Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels, a diverse coalition of the largest industrial sectors in America from farmers to fuel producers and aviation to agribusiness.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n7\nItem 1. Business\nThe global aviation industry is viewed as a \"hard-to-abate\" sector, meaning it is innately difficult to decarbonize. Achieving our long-term goals will require substantial expansion of the SAF market, the adoption of new technologies, engagement from both internal and external stakeholders, as well as partnerships across industries to increase production of alternative fuels and help drive down costs. \nFuel\nOur results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price. We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, including fuel produced by Monroe or procured through the exchange of gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products (\"non-jet fuel products\") the refinery produces, and crude oil for Monroe's operations.\nThe following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs:\nFuel consumption and expense by year\nYear\nGallons Consumed\n(1) \n(in millions)\nCost\n(1)(2)\n(in millions)\nAverage Price Per Gallon\n(1)(2)\nPercentage of Total Operating Expense\n(1)(2)\n2024\n4,114 \n$\n10,566 \n$\n2.57 \n19 \n%\n2023\n3,926 \n$\n11,069 \n$\n2.82 \n21 \n%\n2022\n3,412 \n$\n11,482 \n$\n3.36 \n24 \n%\n(1)\nIncludes the operations of our regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements.\n(2)\nIncludes the impact of fuel hedge activity and refinery segment results.\nMonroe Energy\nOur Monroe subsidiaries operate the Trainer refinery and related logistics assets located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK. These companies are distinct from us, operating under their own management teams and with their own boards. We own Monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel, as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our New York operations.\nRefinery Operations\n. The facility is capable of refining approximately 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day and sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers. \nStrategic Agreements.\n Monroe has agreements in place to exchange the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. \nEnvironmental Sustainability\n. We are evaluating operational pathways for integrating Monroe into Delta's net zero future. Monroe’s sustainability ambitions include being one of the most energy efficient refineries in the country with the lowest energy intensity and greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions on an absolute and per barrel basis. For example, Monroe continues the execution of its plan to replace steam-driven turbines that currently power pumps at the facility with more efficient and reliable electric motors, which will reduce the amount of steam required from the facility’s natural gas-fired boilers. The Monroe team also provides their expertise on refining, biofuels, and the challenges of scaling SAF regularly to the Delta team. \nFuel Hedging Program\nOur derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are related to Monroe’s inventory. We may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. We closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n8\nItem 1. Business\nEmployee Matters\nHuman Capital and Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe believe that the Delta people and culture are our strongest competitive advantage, and the high-quality service that our employees provide sets us apart from other airlines. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 103,000 full-time employee equivalents, of which approximately 100,000 were based in the U.S.\nOur principal human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop people who understand and are committed to delivering the \"Delta Difference\" that is core to our brand. To support these objectives, we have put in place programs that seek to:\n•\nReward our people through highly competitive total compensation designed to share Delta’s success with our employees who make it possible and promote teamwork and collaboration across the business.\n•\nAchieve high performance by fostering our people’s holistic wellbeing including physical, emotional, social and financial wellbeing.\n•\nInvest in employees’ professional development and support their community engagement efforts. \n•\nPrepare our employees for key roles and future leadership positions through a variety of training and development programs.\n•\nEnhance our culture through efforts aimed at making our workplace more engaging, equitable and inclusive for all employees.\nThe health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving these objectives. Delta's Safety Management System is central to promoting a positive safety culture, proactively managing safety risk, and making investments to ensure a safe experience for our employees and customers.\nOur commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is critical to effective human capital management at Delta. Embedded in our business as a global airline is the belief that hiring the most qualified talent with diverse backgrounds and perspectives enables us to best serve our global customers, communities and each other. Our commitment to delivering experiences where all people feel seen, heard and valued continues – taking care of people in this way fosters innovation, talent retention, customer engagement and business growth. In our merit-based hiring and promotions, we seek highly qualified diverse talent internally and externally in an effort to achieve broader representation throughout our organization. \nIn addition, we are reviewing and revising systems, practices and policies in support of our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, with a focus on achieving equitable outcomes for all employees in our merit-based human capital management. Three key areas on which we are focused are (1) reinforcing our diverse talent pipeline by, among other things, seeking expanded hiring candidate slates and interview panels to reflect diverse backgrounds and experiences, (2) expanding our internal and external career pathways and leadership development opportunities, in part, by introducing a skills-first talent approach, which creates merit-based access to career opportunities by considering skills as equivalencies to education, and (3) working to ensure our senior leadership team reflects the diversity of backgrounds and experiences of our 100,000 employees by adopting recruitment strategies that seek qualified leadership candidates with diverse experiences, skills and perspectives and expanding leadership development programs to continue promoting from within.\nWe also believe that listening, engaging and connecting with employees furthers our human capital management objectives. We have historically done so primarily through our open-door policy, employee engagement groups and business resource groups, digital communication across all levels of the company, in-person events with senior management and company-wide and division-specific surveys to evaluate employee satisfaction. \nWe leverage business insights, strengthen employee satisfaction and offer educational and development opportunities to employees through our four employee engagement groups and our twelve employee resource groups, which we refer to as business resource groups, totaling membership of more than 40,000 as of December 31, 2024.\nMembers of senior management participate in regular company-wide town hall discussions with our employees and our senior executive leadership team regularly shares memos with all employees regarding our ongoing commitment to our people and our culture. \nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n9\nItem 1. Business\nWe have also continued to conduct annual employee surveys to seek feedback on employee satisfaction, leadership effectiveness, our culture of safety, our wellbeing programs and our efforts to promote a diverse and inclusive workplace for all employees.\nCollective Bargaining\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 20% of our full-time equivalent employees were represented by unions.\nDomestic airline employees represented by collective bargaining agreements by group\nEmployee Group\nApproximate Number of Employees Represented\nUnion\nDate on which Collective Bargaining Agreement Becomes Amendable\nDelta Pilots\n17,380 \nALPA\nDecember 31, 2026\nDelta Flight Superintendents (Dispatchers)\n(1)\n500 \nPAFCA\nNovember 1, 2024\nEndeavor Pilots\n1,540 \nALPA\nJanuary 1, 2029\nEndeavor Flight Attendants\n1,700 \nAFA\nMarch 31, 2027\n(1)\nWe are in discussions with representatives of PAFCA regarding terms of the collective bargaining agreement that became amendable on November 1, 2024.\nIn addition to the domestic airline employee groups discussed above, approximately 200 refinery employees of our wholly owned subsidiary, Monroe Energy, LLC (\"Monroe\") are represented by the United Steel Workers under an agreement that expires on February 28, 2026. This agreement is governed by the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\"), which generally allows either party to engage in self-help upon the expiration of the agreement. Certain of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by unions, work councils or other local representative groups.\nLabor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees, including at our operating subsidiaries, that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes.\nCompetition\nThe airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), operational reliability, services, products, customer service and loyalty programs. The industry has evolved through mergers, new entries, both domestically and internationally, and changes in international alliances. Consolidation in the airline industry, the presence of subsidized government-sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered, and will continue to alter, the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with significant financial resources, extensive global networks and competitive cost structures.\nDomestic\nOur domestic operations are subject to significant competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and other discount or ultra-low-cost carriers, including Allegiant Air, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. Some of these carriers have business models primarily focused on maintaining low costs, with the intention of providing service at lower fares to destinations served by Delta. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity. We also face competition in small- to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. \nInternational\nOur international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers, including from point-to-point carriers on certain international routes. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European, Asian and Latin American gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. \nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n10\nItem 1. Business\nIn particular, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including several of our joint ventures as well as those of our competitors, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate networks, schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. In addition, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including SkyTeam, the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have enhanced competition in international markets.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (the \"FAA\") exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the U.S. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide air transportation. An air carrier that the DOT finds fit, willing and able to perform the proposed service is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation (including the carriage of passengers and cargo), as applicable. Since the passage of the Airline Industry Deregulation Act in 1978, airlines have generally been free to launch or terminate service to U.S airports without restriction, except with respect to certain slot-controlled and schedule-facilitated airports, as well as certain constraints related to service to small communities governed by the \"Essential Air Services\" program.\nThe DOT has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters, such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition, advertising, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between domestic and international carriers. The DOT engages in regulation of economic matters such as transactions involving allocation of \"slots\" or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at airports where such mechanisms are in place. The FAA has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including airline operating certificates, control of navigable air space, flight personnel, aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety.\nAuthority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. International certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the U.S. President for conformity with national defense and foreign policy objectives.\nThe Transportation Security Administration (\"TSA\") and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a division of the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the U.S.\nAirlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over some airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail. Labor relations in the airline industry, as discussed below, are generally governed by the Railway Labor Act with oversight by the National Mediation Board (\"NMB\"). Environmental matters are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. Privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations.\nFares and Rates\nAirlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city-pairs with minimal governmental regulation, and the industry is characterized by significant price competition. Certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the DOT and the governments of the foreign countries involved. Many of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and fares are subject to commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers.\nRoute Authority\nOur flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limited-entry frequency awards issued by the DOT. The requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements (and a multilateral agreement in the case of the U.S. and the European Union (\"EU\")) with, or permits or approvals issued by, foreign countries. Because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the U.S. and the foreign country or countries involved, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various foreign countries that we serve are subject to renegotiation from time to time. The U.S. government has negotiated \"Open Skies\" agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted access between the U.S. and these foreign markets. \nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n11\nItem 1. Business\nCertain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements. We request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate. While the DOT usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service, there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal. Dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases, especially where another U.S. carrier indicates a willingness to provide service.\nAirport Access\nOperations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports that we serve are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of \"slots\" or similar regulatory mechanisms. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period.\nIn the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan National in Washington, D.C. and LaGuardia and JFK in the New York City area. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations. Similarly, our operations at London's Heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport Association's Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies.\nAirline Labor Regulation\nIn the U.S., airlines and labor unions are governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under the Railway Labor Act, a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the NMB an application alleging a representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by at least 50% of the employees in that craft or class. The NMB then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards, conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class. A labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50% of votes cast are for representation. A certified labor union would then commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer.\nUnder the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. Either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day \"cooling off\" period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may engage in \"self-help,\" unless the U.S. President appoints a Presidential Emergency Board (\"PEB\") to investigate and report on the dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the \"status quo\" for an additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage in self-help. Self-help includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. The U.S. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent self-help by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nEnvironmental Compliance Obligations\n. Our operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment, including regulation of greenhouse gases and other air emissions, noise reduction, water discharges, aircraft drinking water, storage and use of petroleum products and other regulated substances, and the management and disposal of hazardous waste, substances and materials.\nWe are also subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances, which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites. Soil and/or ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports. To address these impacts, we have a program in place to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate these sites. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n12\nItem 1. Business\nIn 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") finalized regulations defining certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\") as \"hazardous substances\" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), and the EPA also finalized standards regulating PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. PFAS are man-made chemicals that have been used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting foams used to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. Numerous states have adopted regulations governing PFAS as well. The EPA’s final rule under CERCLA, and analogous state laws could subject airports, airlines, and refineries, among others, to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination associated with use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam. In addition, some states have adopted legislation prohibiting the manufacture, sale, distribution and/or use of firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS, which may require transition to alternative fire suppression systems. Delta has been developing plans to transition its aircraft maintenance hangars to systems that do not contain intentionally added PFAS. The ultimate impact and associated cost to Delta of these legislative and regulatory developments cannot be predicted at this time.\nGHG Emissions\n. Aviation industry GHG emissions, particularly carbon emissions, and their impact on climate change have become a focus in the international community and within the U.S. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (\"ICAO\") formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"). This program establishes a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon-neutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021. Any growth above the baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offsets or a lower carbon fuel. ICAO set the baseline for establishing airlines’ obligations under CORSIA for 2021 to 2023 based on 2019 travel, and in 2022 set a new, more stringent CORSIA baseline of 85% of 2019, which will apply from 2024 through 2035. \nThe pilot phase of the CORSIA program ran from 2021 through 2023, and is being followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 and a second phase beginning in 2027. Countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase, and the United States agreed to participate in these voluntary phases. Participation in the second phase is mandatory for certain countries, including the United States. The U.S. government has not yet enacted legislation to mandate that U.S. operators participate in CORSIA. Nonetheless, we have voluntarily submitted verified emissions reports on our annual international emissions. While airlines had no offsetting obligations during the pilot phase of CORSIA as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international travel, we expect that international airline emissions will likely exceed the new baseline during the next phase (2024 – 2026). Because certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the initial phases of the program, the impact of CORSIA cannot be predicted at this time. However, CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally.\nAdditionally, the EU requires its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its Emissions Trading Scheme (\"ETS\"). Under these regulations, any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") is subject to the ETS and, beginning in 2012, was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ETS. The initial scope of the ETS, however, was narrowed so that it would apply only to flights within the EEA through 2023 to align with the pilot phase of CORSIA. In 2023, the EU adopted new legislation extending this narrow scope of the EU ETS until 2027. It also requires a review of CORSIA’s effectiveness in 2026, which could potentially lead to expansion of the EU ETS to include all flights departing the EU and EEA. As a result of the United Kingdom’s (\"UK\") withdrawal from the EU, UK flights are no longer part of the EU ETS and are instead regulated under a separate UK ETS scheme. UK ETS is applicable to UK domestic flights and flights from the UK to EEA countries.\nIn 2017, ICAO also adopted aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide (\"CO\n2\n\") emissions from new aircraft. The new aircraft certification standards applied to new fleet types in 2020 and will apply to in-production aircraft no later than 2028. These standards will not apply to existing in-service aircraft. In 2021, the EPA finalized GHG emission standards for new aircraft engines designed to implement the ICAO standards on the same timeframe contemplated by ICAO, and these standards have been upheld in response to legal challenges. Like the ICAO standards, the final EPA standards do not apply to engines on in-service aircraft.\nThe airline industry may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad and become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for GHG emissions in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2023, the EU adopted legislation that imposes a SAF mandate on fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandate requires that, of the jet fuel supplied in the EU, 2% must be SAF beginning in 2025, and the percentage increases incrementally over time to 70% in 2050. This mandate is expected to increase the cost of SAF in the EU. In 2024, the UK also adopted legislation that imposes a SAF mandate on producers that supply fuel to UK airports, and other countries are also considering similar mandates. \nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n13\nItem 1. Business\nAdditional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry. In addition to direct costs, such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations. Certain airports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, GHG emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure. We are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such developments.\nNoise\n. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of U.S. airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. This statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft first effective after October 1, 1990 require FAA approval. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread. In addition, foreign governments may enact or allow airports to enact similar restrictions, which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditures in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions. For example, in 2022, to reduce noise, the Netherlands announced a multi-phase plan to reduce the maximum number of flights authorized annually at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. In 2023, airlines and airline associations, including Delta and KLM, challenged the initial phase of the plan. The U.S., the European Commission and other governments also raised legal concerns about the plan with the Dutch government. In November 2023, the Netherlands suspended the initial phase of the plan, and in 2024, the Netherlands Supreme Court found that the Dutch government’s flight reduction plan was unlawful. The Dutch government has issued a revised plan, which is under review with the European Commission. Neither the outcome of the review of the plan, nor the impact of its implementation, can be determined at this time.\nRefinery Matters\n. Monroe's operation of the Trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas and other air emissions.\nUnder the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") was created, setting up specific targets of renewable fuel to be used in the U.S. economy by mandating the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and on-road diesel (\"Transportation Fuels\"). Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\") are assigned to renewable fuels produced by or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels, by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs. Because Monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market. Market prices for RINs have been volatile and marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases. However, in June 2023, the EPA finalized RFS volume requirements for 2023, 2024 and 2025, which has ameliorated the historical volatility in market prices for RINs.\nCivil Reserve Air Fleet Program\nWe participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program (the \"CRAF Program\"), which permits the U.S. military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating U.S. airlines during airlift emergencies, national emergencies or times of war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF Program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period that ends on October 31, 2030, with the opportunity to opt in or out of the program every two years. The CRAF Program has only been activated three times since it was created in 1951, most recently in 2021 to support the military’s effort to evacuate people from Afghanistan following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n14\nItem 1.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n \nOF OPERATIONS\nThis section of Form 10-K does not address certain items regarding the year ended December 31, 2022. Discussion and analysis of 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information as well as the material risk factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2024 Financial Overview\nOur 2024 operating income was $6.0 billion, an improvement of $474 million\n \ncompared to 2023, and operating income, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $6.0 billion, a decrease of $318 million compared to 2023.\n \nOperating income, adjusted in 2023 excluded one-time pilot agreement expenses and other items. The changes in operating income and operating income, adjusted are primarily resulting from increases in both revenue and operating expenses as described below. As a result of our strong performance in 2023 and 2024, we paid profit sharing of $1.4 billion in February 2024 to our employees and will pay another $1.4 billion in February 2025 in recognition of these achievements.\nRevenue.\n Compared to 2023, our 2024 operating revenue increased $3.6 billion, or 6%, primarily due to a 6% increase in capacity driven by continued strength in demand for domestic and international travel and premium products, as well as an increase in revenue related to refinery sales to third parties. Total revenue, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased in 2024 by $2.3 billion, or 4.3%, compared to 2023. Adjustments were to exclude revenue related to refinery sales to third parties. In July 2024, our operations were significantly disrupted by the CrowdStrike-caused outage. We estimate that this disruption led to a direct revenue impact of approximately $380 million related to approximately 7,000 flight cancellations over five days, which reduced our expected year-over-year capacity growth by approximately 0.4 percentage points during 2024.\nOperating Expense.\n Total operating expense increased $3.1 billion, or 6%, compared to 2023, primarily resulting from higher employee-related costs from increased wages and related expenses, higher volume-related expenses associated with the 6% increase in capacity and an increase in expenses related to refinery sales to third parties. The CrowdStrike-caused outage and operational recovery resulted in approximately $170 million of additional operating expenses primarily due to customer expense reimbursements and crew-related costs. Fuel expense was approximately $50 million lower than it would have been as a result of the flight cancellations. Total operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased $2.7 billion, or 5%, compared to 2023. Current year adjustments were primarily to exclude expenses related to refinery sales to third parties, while prior year adjustments also excluded the pilot agreement and related expenses.\nOur total operating cost per available seat mile (\"CASM\") of 19.30 cents was comparable to 2023, primarily due to lower fuel expense and a 6% increase in capacity offset by higher expenses associated with the increase in capacity and related to refinery sales to third parties. Non-fuel unit costs (\"CASM-Ex\", a non-GAAP financial measure), which excludes fuel, expenses related to refinery sales to third parties and other items, increased 2.8% to 13.54 cents compared to 2023.\nNon-Operating Results.\n Total non-operating expense was $1.3 billion in 2024, compared to total non-operating income of $87 million in 2023, primarily due to mark-to-market gains on certain of our equity investments in 2023 partially offset by lower expenses in 2024 associated with our debt reduction initiatives.\nCash Flow.\n During 2024, operating activities generated $8.0 billion, primarily from ticket sales and the sale of SkyMiles to our partners. Total cash sales of SkyMiles to American Express were $7.4 billion during 2024, an increase of approximately 8% compared to 2023. Investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of approximately $3.7 billion, primarily for $5.1 billion of capital expenditures, partially offset by $1.1 billion of net redemptions of short-term investments. After adjusting for certain activities, these results generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) in 2024.\nAlso, during 2024 we had cash outflows of approximately $4.0 billion primarily related to repayment of our debt and finance leases, including approximately $1.1 billion for early repayments and the remainder from scheduled maturities.

We generated higher growth in premium products revenue compared to main cabin with the delivery of new aircraft that include more premium seat capacity and an increase in yield in premium products compared to main cabin, as we see more consumers choosing these premium offerings.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n35\nItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations\nInternational\nInternational passenger revenue for 2024 increased 5% with capacity up 8% compared to 2023. Revenue in each international region increased in 2024, with the Pacific growing at the greatest rate as we continue to restore capacity in the region.\nDemand for transatlantic travel remained at high levels throughout 2024 with revenue increasing slightly on flat capacity compared to 2023. Revenue growth in the Atlantic was led by demand for travel to European leisure destinations and our premium product offerings.\nLatin America region revenue increased during 2024 compared to 2023, due to strong demand for leisure destinations in South America and the Caribbean on a 15% increase in capacity. We continued to build on the strength of our joint venture with LATAM in South America through additional routes, greater network connectivity, and a more streamlined airport experience.\nThe Pacific region benefited from improved demand for travel to the region, particularly to South Korea and Japan, on 32% increased capacity. Our performance in South Korea benefited from the strength of our joint venture partnership with Korean Air, which enables passengers to more seamlessly connect to over 80 destinations in Asia. Revenue from flights to Japan increased due to higher demand for travel from the United States due in part to weakness in the Japanese Yen compared to the U.S. dollar.\nOther Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\nIncrease (Decrease)\n% Increase (Decrease)\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nRefinery\n$\n4,642 \n$\n3,379 \n$\n1,263 \n37 \n%\nLoyalty program\n3,297 \n3,093 \n204\n7 \n%\nAncillary businesses\n772 \n840 \n(68)\n(8)\n%\nMiscellaneous\n1,216 \n1,104 \n112\n10 \n%\nTotal other revenue\n$\n9,927 \n$\n8,416 \n$\n1,511 \n18 \n%\nRefinery. \nThis represents refinery sales of non-jet fuel products to third parties.

These revenues are mainly driven by customer spend on American Express cards and new cardholder acquisitions. Revenues from our relationship with American Express increased compared to 2023 driven by co-brand card spend growth and card account acquisitions.\nAncillary Businesses.\n This includes revenues from aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation package operations.\nMiscellaneous.\n This is primarily composed of revenues related to lounge access, including access provided to certain American Express cardholders, codeshare agreements and certain other commercial relationships.

In June 2024 we also increased our minimum starting wage for domestic mainline employees to $19 per hour. Salaries and related costs also increased due to additional crew-related costs resulting from the CrowdStrike-caused outage and costs to support increased traffic. Employee benefits increased on higher healthcare expenses and from travel passes awarded to employees in recognition of their hard work through the summer. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our employee benefit plans.\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes. \nFuel expense decreased $503 million compared to 2023 primarily due to a 12% decrease in the market price of jet fuel partially offset by a 5% increase in consumption on a 6% increase in capacity, resulting in a 1% improvement in fuel efficiency. Fuel expense was also approximately $50 million lower than it would have been as a result of the 7,000 flight cancellations over the five-day period following the CrowdStrike-caused outage.\nFuel expense and average price per gallon\nAverage Price Per Gallon\nYear Ended December 31,\nIncrease (Decrease)\nYear Ended December 31,\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(in millions, except per gallon data)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nFuel purchase cost\n(1)\n$\n10,583 \n$\n11,506 \n$\n(923)\n$\n2.57 \n$\n2.93 \n$\n(0.36)\nFuel hedge impact\n21 \n(52)\n73 \n0.01 \n(0.01)\n0.02 \nRefinery segment impact\n(38)\n(385)\n347 \n(0.01)\n(0.10)\n0.09 \nTotal fuel expense\n$\n10,566 \n$\n11,069 \n$\n(503)\n$\n2.57 \n$\n2.82 \n$\n(0.25)\n(1)\nMarket price for jet fuel at airport locations, including related taxes and transportation costs.\nAncillary Businesses and Refinery. \nAncillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with refinery sales to third parties, aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation package operations. The increase in these expenses was primarily related to higher refinery sales to third parties, which increased $1.3 billion compared to 2023. See \"Refinery Segment\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents. \nThe increase in landing fees and other rents resulted from higher rates charged by airports following extensive redevelopment projects at numerous facilities and more flights compared to 2023.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n37\nItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations\nPilot agreement and related expenses.\n In the March 2023 quarter, Delta pilots ratified a new four-year Pilot Working Agreement effective January 1, 2023. The agreement includes numerous work rule changes and pay rate increases during the four-year term, including an initial pay rate increase of 18%. The agreement also includes a provision for a one-time payment made upon ratification in the March 2023 quarter of $735 million. Additionally, we recorded adjustments to other benefit-related items of approximately $130 million.\nOther. \nThe increase in other is primarily due to higher volume-related expenses associated with increased capacity, such as flight crew and other employee travel and incidental costs and the impact of service recovery costs including customer expense reimbursements from the CrowdStrike-caused outage.\nNon-Operating Results\nYear Ended December 31,\nFavorable (Unfavorable)\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nInterest expense, net\n$\n(747)\n$\n(834)\n$\n87 \nGain/(loss) on investments, net\n(319)\n1,263 \n(1,582)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt \n(39)\n(63)\n24 \nMiscellaneous, net\n(232)\n(279)\n47 \nTotal non-operating (expense)/income, net\n$\n(1,337)\n$\n87 \n$\n(1,424)\nInterest expense, net. \nInterest expense, net includes interest expense and interest income. This decreased compared to 2023 primarily on reduced interest expense resulting from our debt reduction initiatives, which was partially offset by lower interest income. We are reducing the total amount of interest expense by pre-paying our debt in addition to periodic amortization payments and scheduled maturities. During 2024, we made\n \n$4.0 billion of payments on debt and finance lease obligations, including approximately $1.1 billion of early repayments. This included early extinguishment of $844 million in principal related to a portion of the SkyMiles Term Loan and various secured and unsecured notes, and approximately $280 million for finance leased aircraft that were purchased. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization payments and scheduled maturities, during 2025 and beyond. Interest rates on the Payroll Support Program loans are 1.00% for the first five years and the applicable SOFR plus 2.00% in the final five years. The applicable interest rates will begin to adjust for each loan in April 2025, January 2026 and April 2026.\nInterest income decreased due to lower cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances throughout most of 2024.\nGain/(loss) on investments, net.\n See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our equity investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Net unrealized gains on our equity method investments during 2023 were primarily related to Wheels Up, Hanjin-KAL and LATAM.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt.\n This reflects the losses incurred in the early repayment of debt referenced above.\nMiscellaneous, net.\n Miscellaneous, net primarily includes employee benefit plans net periodic cost, charitable contributions, our share of our equity method investments' results and foreign exchange gains/(losses). See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our equity investments.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 26% and 18% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate is impacted by net pre-tax income or loss recognized on our equity investments, which are considered capital assets for tax purposes, because realized capital losses can only be deducted against realized capital gains. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $2.7 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards which we are expecting to utilize during 2025. These net operating loss carryforwards were primarily generated in 2020 and do not expire.\nWe expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for 2025. In certain periods, we may have adjustments to our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of changes in prior year estimates, mark-to-market adjustments on our equity investments and tax laws enacted during the period, which will impact the effective tax rate for that period.\nFor more information about our income taxes, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n38\nItem 7. MD&A - Refinery Segment\nRefinery Segment\nThe refinery operated by our wholly owned subsidiary Monroe primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Monroe has agreements in place to exchange the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. The jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery typically provides approximately 200,000 barrels per day, or approximately 75% of our consumption, for use in our airline operations. The refinery regularly optimizes its sales and exchange activities of non-jet fuel products based on market conditions and the availability of counterparties for exchanges. Refinery revenues increased in 2024, primarily driven by the increase in third party refinery sales on reduced exchanges of non-jet fuel products due to the availability of exchange counterparties, and reduced production in 2023 related to the planned maintenance turnaround. The refinery operating income decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 mainly due to lower industry refining margins.\nRefinery segment financial information\nYear Ended December 31,\n% Increase (Decrease)\n(in millions, except per gallon data)\n2024\n2023\nExchanged products \n$\n1,473 \n$\n2,354 \n(37)\n%\nSales of refined products \n231 \n304 \n(24)\n%\nSales to airline segment\n1,421 \n1,535 \n(7)\n%\nThird-party refinery sales\n4,642 \n3,379 \n37 \n%\nOperating revenue \n$\n7,767 \n$\n7,572 \n3 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n38 \n$\n385 \n(90)\n%\nRefinery segment impact on average price per fuel gallon \n$\n(0.01)\n$\n(0.10)\n(90)\n%\nA refinery is subject to annual EPA requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and on-road diesel fuel it produces. A refinery may meet its obligation by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels, by purchasing Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\") in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs. Because Monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market. Monroe incurred $203 million\n \nin RINs compliance costs during 2024, compared to $323 million incurred in 2023.\nFor more information regarding the refinery's results, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Statistics\nYear Ended December 31,\nConsolidated \n(1)\n2024\n2023\nRevenue passenger miles (in millions)\n246,145 \n232,241 \nAvailable seat miles (in millions)\n288,394 \n272,033 \nPassenger mile yield\n20.68 \n¢\n21.06 \n¢\nPassenger revenue per available seat mile (\"PRASM\")\n17.65 \n¢\n17.98 \n¢\nTotal revenue per available seat mile (\"TRASM\")\n21.37 \n¢\n21.34 \n¢\nTRASM, adjusted\n(2)\n19.76 \n¢\n20.10 \n¢\nCost per available seat mile (\"CASM\")\n19.30 \n¢\n19.31 \n¢\nCASM-Ex\n(2)\n13.54 \n¢\n13.17 \n¢\nPassenger load factor\n85 \n%\n85 \n%\nFuel gallons consumed (in millions)\n4,114 \n3,926 \nAverage price per fuel gallon\n(3)\n$\n2.57 \n$\n2.82 \nAverage price per fuel gallon, adjusted\n(2)(3)\n$\n2.56 \n$\n2.83 \nApproximate full-time equivalent employees, end of period\n103,000 \n103,000 \n(1)\nIncludes the operations of our regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements.

MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $6.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities (\"liquidity\"). We expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities in 2024 provided $8.0 billion of cash flow compared to $6.5 billion in 2023. We expect to continue generating cash flows from operations during 2025.\nOur operating cash flow is impacted by the following factors:\nSeasonality of Advance Ticket Sales\n. We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months.\nSale of Miles to Participating Companies.\n Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Total cash sales to American Express were $7.4 billion during 2024, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the cash sales from marketing agreements.\nFuel\n. Fuel expense represented approximately 19% of our total operating expense during 2024. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. The average fuel price per gallon decreased in 2024. We expect continued higher market price volatility compared to historical levels due to geopolitical events. As capacity increased throughout the year, fuel consumption was higher in 2024 than 2023. We expect fuel consumption to increase in 2025 aligned with capacity, partially offset by improvements in the fuel efficiency of our fleet.\nWe expect our commitment to environmental sustainability to depend on increased use of SAF, which is not presently available at scale or at prices competitive to jet fuel. While we do not expect a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements in the near-term from the use of SAF, we are unable to predict the financial impact of increased use of SAF on our Consolidated Financial Statements over the longer term as government policies and incentives for, and sufficient third-party investment in, SAF are necessary to make its use in larger quantities commercially and economically feasible.\nEmployee Benefit Obligations. \nWe sponsor defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. Our funding obligations for defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") and any additional applicable legislation. We had no minimum funding requirements in 2024, and estimate that there will be approximately $80 million of minimum funding requirements under these plans in 2025. Payments to defined contribution plans were approximately $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn addition, we have employee benefit obligations relating primarily to projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans. Benefit payments for these obligations are expected to be approximately $500 million on an annual basis over the next five years. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our employee benefit obligations.\nProfit Sharing. \nOur broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items.\nWe pay profit sharing annually in February. We paid $1.4 billion in 2024 to our employees in recognition of their contributions toward meeting our financial goals. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $1.4 billion in profit sharing expense based on 2024 pre-tax profit, which we will pay to employees in February 2025.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n40\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nContract Carrier Obligations. \nWe have certain estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These minimum amounts are based on the required minimum levels of flying by the regional carriers under the respective agreements and assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying. As of December 31, 2024 the total of these minimum amounts was $7.7 billion and range from approximately $700 million to $1.8 billion on an annual basis over the next five years. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our contract carrier obligations.\nOperating Lease Obligations. \nAs described further in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2024 we had a total of $8.4 billion of minimum operating lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $600 million to $1.0 billion on an annual basis over the next five years.\nOther Obligations. \nWe have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to, aviation-related, maintenance, technology, sponsorships, marketing, insurance and other third-party services and products. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $9.3 billion of such obligations, which range from approximately $400 million to $1.3 billion on an annual basis over the next five years.\nIncome Taxes. \nWe expect to utilize our remaining net operating loss carryforwards during 2025. Once these are exhausted, under current tax laws, we expect to be a partial cash taxpayer during 2025.\nInvesting Activities\nShort-Term Investments.\n In 2024, we redeemed a net of\n \n$1.1 billion in short-term investments. During 2024 our investment strategy shifted to no longer include short-term investments and accordingly as of December 31, 2024 we have no short-term investments and do not expect any further activity in the foreseeable future. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments.\nCapital Expenditures. \nOur capital expenditures (i.e., property and equipment additions in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (\"cash flows statement\")) were $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion\n \nin 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchases of aircraft, airport construction projects (discussed below), fleet modifications and technology enhancements.\nWe have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained, but are under no obligation to use, long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft. Our expected 2025 capital spend of approximately $5.0 billion, which may vary depending on financing decisions, will be primarily for aircraft, including deliveries and advance deposit payments, as well as fleet modifications and technology enhancements. As described in Part I, Item 1. \"Business - Environmental Sustainability,\" aircraft fleet renewal is an important component of our environmental sustainability strategy and the path to achievement of our ambitious climate goals, which will continue to require extensive capital investment in future periods. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our aircraft purchase commitments, which totaled approximately $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nNew York-LaGuardia Redevelopment. \nIn 2024, we substantially completed all construction for the replacement of Terminals C and D of the New York-LaGuardia Airport with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility. \nThe project cost approximately $4.2 billion and was funded through debt issuance, existing cash and a Port Authority contribution of approximately $500 million. We entered into loan agreements to fund a portion of the construction, which are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (\"balance sheets\") as debt with the proceeds reflected as restricted cash. Using funding primarily provided by these arrangements, we spent approximately\n \n$300 million, $500 million and $650 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect only a small amount of spend in 2025 as the project is finalized. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the debt related to the redevelopment project.\nLos Angeles International Airport (\"LAX\") Construction. \nIn 2023, we substantially completed all construction for the LAX upgrade and modernization project that consolidates Terminals 2 and 3, as well as connects these terminals to the Tom Bradley International Terminal. The project cost approximately $2.5 billion.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n41\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nA substantial majority of the project costs were funded through the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (\"RAIC\"), a California public benefit corporation, using a revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders. The credit facility was executed in 2017 and we have guaranteed the obligations of the RAIC under the credit facility. Loans made under the credit facility are being repaid with the proceeds from the City of Los Angeles' (the \"City\") purchase of completed project assets. Under the lease agreement and subsequent project component approvals by the City's Board of Airport Commissioners, the City appropriated approximately $1.8 billion to purchase completed project assets, representing the maximum allowable reimbursement by the City. Costs incurred in excess of the $1.8 billion maximum were not reimbursed by the City.\nOur net project costs were approximately $700 million, of which approximately $350 million has been reflected as investing activities and approximately $350 million as operating activities in our cash flows statement since the project started in 2017. We expect only a small amount of spend in 2025 as the project is finalized.\nFinancing Activities\nDebt and Finance Leases.\n In 2024, we had cash outflows of approximately $4.0 billion related to repayments of our debt and finance leases, including approximately $1.1 billion of early repayments. This included early extinguishment of $844 million in principal related to a portion of the SkyMiles Term Loan and various secured and unsecured notes, and approximately $280 million for finance leased aircraft that were purchased. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization payments and scheduled maturities, during 2025 and beyond.\nDuring 2024, Fitch and S&P Global upgraded their credit ratings of Delta to BBB-, an investment grade rating. When combined with Moody's, which affirmed our credit rating (Baa3) and upgraded its outlook for Delta to positive in 2024, we have now achieved investment-grade ratings across the major credit rating agencies. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the effect of these ratings changes on our debt agreements.\nThe principal amount of our debt and finance leases was $16.2 billion at December 31, 2024.\nFuture Debt Obligations.\n As described further in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2024, scheduled maturities of our debt in 2025 are $1.8 billion, with maturities from 2026 through 2029 ranging between $600 million and $2.3 billion annually. As of December 31, 2024, scheduled maturities after 2029 aggregate to $6.6 billion. In addition, we are obligated to make periodic interest payments at fixed and variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of December 31, 2024, these interest obligations total approximately $3.0 billion and range from approximately $200 million to $600 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nFinance Lease Obligations. \nAs described further in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2024 we had a total of $897 million of minimum finance lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $30 million to $400 million\n \non an annual basis over the next five years.\nCapital Returns to Shareholders. \nDuring 2024, we continued our quarterly dividend program with $0.10 per share payments in the March 2024 and June 2024 quarters and $0.15 per share payments in the September 2024 and December 2024 quarters. Total dividend payments during the year ended December 31, 2024 were $321 million.\nOn February 6, 2025, the Board of Directors approved and we will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on March 20, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 27, 2025.\nUndrawn Lines of Credit. \nAs of December 31, 2024 we had approximately $3.1 billion undrawn and available under our revolving credit facilities.\nCovenants. \nWe were in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements at December 31, 2024. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the covenants in our debt agreements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n42\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise noted below.\nLoyalty Program\nOur SkyMiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn miles by flying on Delta, Delta Connection carriers and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program. When traveling, customers earn miles primarily based on the passenger's loyalty program status, fare class and ticket price. Customers can also earn miles through participating companies. Miles are redeemable by customers for air travel on Delta and other participating airlines, access to Delta Sky Club and other program awards. To facilitate transactions with participating companies, we sell miles to non-airline businesses and other airlines.\nThe loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations (1) passenger ticket sales earning miles and (2) sale of miles to participating companies. \nPassenger Ticket Sales Earning Miles.\n Passenger ticket sales earning miles provide customers with (1) miles earned and (2) air transportation, which are each considered performance obligations. We value each performance obligation on a standalone basis. To value the miles earned, we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash, which is referred to as equivalent ticket value (\"ETV\"). Our estimate of ETV is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed (\"mileage breakage\"). We use statistical models to estimate mileage breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions regarding the redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. We recognize mileage breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed.\nAt December 31, 2024, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles program was $8.8 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an impact of less than 1% of total operating revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nWe defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused. A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the ETV of a mile would have decreased total operating revenue by less than 1% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred associated with the miles earned.\nSale of Miles to Participating Companies.\n Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies, such as credit card, ridesharing, retail, car rental and hotel companies, with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the initial terms of our marketing contracts are from one to thirteen years. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total cash sales from marketing agreements related to our loyalty program were $7.4 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations, as discussed below.\nOur most significant arrangement to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Our agreements with American Express provide for joint marketing, grant certain benefits to Delta-American Express co-branded credit card holders (\"cardholders\") and American Express Membership Rewards program participants, and allow American Express to market its services or products using our customer database. Cardholders earn miles for making purchases using co-branded cards, and certain cardholders may also receive baggage fee waivers, lounge access, priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on Delta. Additionally, participants in the American Express Membership Rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program. We sell miles to American Express which are then provided to their customers under the co-brand credit card program and the Membership Rewards program.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n43\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe account for marketing agreements, including those with American Express, by allocating the consideration to the individual products and services delivered. We allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consist of award travel, baggage fee waivers, lounge access, priority boarding and the use of our brand. We determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation adjusted for mileage breakage, (3) published rates on our website for baggage fees, Delta Sky Club lounge access and other benefits while traveling on Delta, (4) brand value (using estimated royalties generated from the use of our brand) and (5) volume discounts provided to certain partners.\nWe defer the amount allocated to award travel as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. Revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight, such as baggage fee waivers, is recognized as travel-related services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed. Revenue allocated to Delta Sky Club lounge access is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided. Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily brand value, is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered.\nThe timing of mile redemptions can vary widely; however, the majority of new miles have historically been redeemed within two years of being earned. The loyalty program deferred revenue classified as a current liability represents our estimate of revenue expected to be recognized in the next twelve months based on projected redemptions, while the balance classified as a noncurrent liability represents our estimate of revenue expected to be recognized beyond twelve months.\nFor additional information on our significant accounting policies related to the loyalty program, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPassenger Ticket Sales\nWe defer sales of passenger tickets to be flown by us or that we sell on behalf of other airlines in our air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation. For tickets that we sell on behalf of other airlines, we reduce the air traffic liability when consideration is remitted to those airlines. The air traffic liability primarily includes sales of passenger tickets with scheduled departure dates in the future and travel credits, which can be applied as payment toward the cost of a ticket. We periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and may record adjustments in our Consolidated Statement of Operations (\"income statement\"). These adjustments relate primarily to tickets that expire unused (\"ticket breakage\") and items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets such as refunds, exchanges and transactions with other airlines.\nWe estimate the value of ticket breakage and recognize revenue at the scheduled flight date. Our ticket breakage estimates are primarily based on historical experience, ticket contract terms and customers’ travel behavior. At December 31, 2024, the aggregate air traffic liability balance was $7.1 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in the amount of tickets estimated to expire unused would result in an impact of less than 1% of total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nFor additional information on our significant accounting policies related to passenger ticket sales, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. We assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, we consider various market factors, including certain of the key assumptions listed below. We analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n44\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nWhen we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both comparable public company multiples (a market approach) and projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach). When we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (3) projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach).\nKey Assumptions.\n The key assumptions in our impairment tests include (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) current discount rates, (3) observable market transactions and (4) anticipated changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., changes in slot access and/or availability, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals). These assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use. Because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates. In addition, when performing a qualitative valuation, we consider the amount by which the intangible assets' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach.\nChanges in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs, (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened U.S. and global economies or other factors, (4) prolonged interruption to our operations, (5) changes to the regulatory environment, (6) operational or performance changes by other airlines and (7) strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets.\n \nGoodwill\n. Our goodwill balance, which is related to the airline segment, was $9.8 billion at December 31, 2024.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets. \nOur identifiable intangible assets, which are related to the airline segment, had a net carrying amount of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024, of which $5.9 billion related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements. Definite-lived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements. \nDuring the December 2024 quarter, we performed qualitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including applicable factors noted above, and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired. Our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors that impact the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We previously performed quantitative assessments in the December 2023 quarter, noting no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n \nFor additional information on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets' significant accounting policies and the related fair values and book values, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are generally closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. As of December 31, 2024, the funded status for these plans recorded on our balance sheets was $938 million, which is the net of our benefit obligation of $15.0 billion and plan assets of $15.9 billion. We had no minimum funding requirements in 2024, and estimate that there will be approximately $80 million of minimum funding requirements under these plans in 2025. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations, plan assets and net periodic cost/(benefit) are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy of plan participants.\nDiscount Rate. \nWe determine our discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high-quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analyses specific to our estimated future benefit payments for each plan. We used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 5.71% and 5.31% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return. \nOur expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n45\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan. This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments. The expected long-term rate of return on our defined benefit pension plan assets is 6.97%.\nThe impact of a 0.50% change in weighted average discount rate and 1.00% change in expected long-term rate of return on assets are shown in the table below:\nBenefit plan effects of change in assumptions used\nChange in Assumption\nEffect on 2025\nPension Cost/(Benefit)\nEffect on Accrued Pension Liability at December 31, 2024\n0.50% decrease in weighted average discount rate\n$\n12 \n million\n$\n674 \n million\n0.50% increase in weighted average discount rate\n$\n(12)\n million\n$\n(624)\n million\n1.00% decrease in expected long-term rate of return on assets\n$\n154 \n million\n$\n— \n1.00% increase in expected long-term rate of return on assets\n$\n(154)\n million\n$\n— \nLife Expectancy\n. Changes in life expectancy may significantly impact our benefit obligations and future net periodic cost/(benefit). Each year we review information published by the Society of Actuaries and other publicly available information to develop our best estimate of life expectancy for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations.\nFunding. \nOur funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by ERISA and any additional applicable legislation. Under current legislation, any required funding would be amortized over a rolling 15-year period and calculated using a discount rate of no less than 4.75% through 2030.\nWhile recent legislation makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets, statutory requirements and demographic data for participants. \nInvestments Valued at Net Asset Value (\"NAV\") Per Share.\n On an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments. These investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are typically valued on a monthly or quarterly basis by third-party administrators, valuation agents or fund managers with an annual audit performed by an independent third-party, but certain of these investments have a lag in the availability of data. We solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments.\nFor additional information on our significant accounting policies related to defined benefit pension plans, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Standards\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" This standard requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items by reportable segment. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2024. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our segment reporting.\nStandards Effective in Future Years\nIncome Taxes.\n In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\" This standard enhances disclosures related to income taxes, including the rate reconciliation and information on income taxes paid. This ASU is effective beginning January 1, 2025. Upon adoption of this ASU we expect to include certain additional disclosures in the effective income tax rate reconciliation in the footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n46\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.\n In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40).\" This standard requires disclosure of specific information about costs and expenses and becomes effective January 1, 2027. We are assessing the impact of this ASU and, upon adoption, may be required to include certain additional disclosures in the footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSupplemental Information\nWe sometimes use information (\"non-GAAP financial measures\") that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.\nIncluded below are reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used within this Form 10-K to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding. These reconciliations include certain adjustments to GAAP measures to provide comparability between the reported periods, if applicable, as indicated below:\n•\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges. \nMark-to-market (\"MTM\") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period, and therefore we remove this impact to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core performance. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period.\n•\nOne-time pilot agreement expenses. \nDuring 2023, Delta pilots ratified a new four-year Pilot Working Agreement effective January 1, 2023. The agreement includes a provision for a one-time payment made upon ratification in the March 2023 quarter of $735 million. Additionally, we recorded adjustments to other benefit-related items of approximately $130 million. Adjusting for these expenses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core cost performance.\n•\nThird-party refinery sales. \nRefinery sales to third parties, and related expenses, are not related to our airline segment. Excluding these sales therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.\n•\nAircraft fuel and related taxes. \nThe volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.\n•\nProfit sharing.\n We adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.\nOperating income, adjusted reconciliation\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nOperating income\n$\n5,995 \n$\n5,521 \nAdjusted for:\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges\n21 \n(52)\nOne-time pilot agreement expenses\n— \n864 \nOperating income, adjusted\n$\n6,016 \n$\n6,334 \nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K\n47\nItem 7.

We present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Adjustments include:\n•\nNet redemptions of short-term investments.\n Net redemptions of short-term investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period, including gains and losses. We adjust for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow generated by our operations.\n•\nNet cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other.\n Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities and capital expenditures.
