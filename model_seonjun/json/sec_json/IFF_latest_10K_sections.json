  "item1": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.\nWe are a leading creator and manufacturer of food, beverage, health & biosciences, scent and pharma solutions and complementary adjacent products, including natural health ingredients, which are used in a wide variety of consumer products. Our products are sold principally to manufacturers of dairy, meat, beverages, snacks, savory, sweet, baked goods, grain processors and other foods, personal care products, soaps and detergents, cleaning products, perfumes, dietary supplements, food protection, infant, elderly and animal nutrition, functional food, pharmaceutical and oral care products. As a result, we hold global leadership positions in the Food & Beverage, Home & Personal Care and Health & Wellness markets, and across key Tastes, Textures, Scents, Nutrition, Enzymes, Cultures, Soy Proteins, Pharmaceutical Excipients and Probiotics categories.\nSales in 2024 were $11.484 billion. Our business is geographically diverse, with sales in the U.S. representing approximately \n28%\n of sales in 2024. No other country represented more than 10% of sales. In 2024, no customer accounted for 10% or more of sales.\nOur Product Offerings\nAs of December 31, 2024, our business consisted of four segments: Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions.\nNourish\nAs a leading creator of ingredients and solutions, we help our customers deliver on the promise of healthy and delicious foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. We create products in our regional creative centers which allows us to satisfy local customer preferences, while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards. We develop thousands of different Nourish offerings, most of which are tailor-made, and we continually develop new ingredients and solutions to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs.\nOur Nourish segment consists of an innovative and broad portfolio of natural-based ingredients to enhance nutritional value, texture and functionality in a wide range of beverage, dairy, bakery, confectionery and culinary applications and consists of Ingredients and Flavors.\nIngredients\n include a diversified portfolio across natural and plant-based specialty food ingredients derived from herbs and plants that provide texturizing solutions used in the food industry, food protection solutions used in food and beverage products, as well as specialty soy and pea protein with value-added formulations, emulsifiers and sweeteners. Natural food protection ingredients consist of natural antioxidants and anti-microbials used for natural food preservation and shelf-life extension for beverages, cosmetic and healthcare products, pet food and feed additives. Ingredients also includes savory solutions (such as spices, marinades, mixtures) and inclusion products (such as products combining flavorings with fruit, vegetables and other natural ingredients), formerly part of \nFood Designs.\n During the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced our entry into an agreement to sell a portion of the Savory Solutions business and completed the divestiture on May 31, 2023.\nFlavors\n include a range of flavor compounds and natural taste solutions that are ultimately used by our customers in savory products (soups, sauces, meat, fish, poultry, snacks, etc.), beverages (juice drinks, carbonated or flavored beverages, spirits, etc.), sweets (bakery products, candy, cereal, chewing gum, etc.), and dairy products (yogurt, ice cream, cheese, etc.). Flavors also include value-added spices and seasoning ingredients for meat, food service, convenience, alternative protein and culinary products.\nHealth & Biosciences\nOur Health & Biosciences segment consists of the development and production of an advanced biotechnology-derived portfolio of enzymes, food cultures, probiotics and specialty ingredients for food and non-food applications. Among many other applications, this biotechnology-driven portfolio includes cultures for use in fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese and fermented beverages, probiotic strains, many with documented clinical health claims for use as dietary supplements and through industrial fermentation the production of enzymes and microorganisms that provide product and process performance benefits to household detergents, animal feed, ethanol production and brewing. Health & Biosciences is comprised of Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes, Home & Personal Care, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing.\nHealth\n provides ingredients for dietary supplements, functional food and beverage, specialized nutrition and pharma.\nCultures & Food Enzymes\n provides products that aim to serve the global demand for healthy, natural, clean label and fermented food for fresh dairy, cheese, bakery and brewing products. Such products contribute to extended shelf life, stability, taste and texture, helping our customers to improve their product offerings. The business’s enzyme solutions also allow our customers to provide low sugar, high fiber and lactose-free dairy products.\n 3\nTable of\n Contents\n \nHome & Personal Care\n produces enzymes for laundry and dishwashing detergents, cleaning and textiles to help enhance the product and process performance of products in the fabric and home care, textiles and industrials and personal care markets. The business also produces patented enzymatic polymers that are renewable, biodegradable alternatives to functional ingredients used in home cleaning and beauty care products.\nAnimal Nutrition\n produces feed enzymes and animal health solutions that help to improve nutrition, welfare, performance and sustainability of livestock animal farming.\nGrain Processing\n produces yeasts and enzymes for biofuel production and carbohydrate processing.\nScent\nOur Scent segment creates fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and best-known household and personal care products. Consumer insights, science and creativity are at the heart of our Scent business, and, along with our unique portfolio of natural and synthetic ingredients, global footprint, innovative technologies and know-how, and customer intimacy, we believe make us a market leader in scent products. The Scent segment is comprised of Fragrance Compounds and Fragrance Ingredients. We completed the divestiture of our Cosmetic Ingredients business, previously within the Scent segment, on April 2, 2024.\nFragrance Compounds\n are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple fragrance ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods. Our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories: fine fragrances and consumer fragrances.\nOur perfumers harness creativity and leverage our innovative captive molecules, sustainable natural ingredients obtained with innovative processes, biotech ingredients, data science, and consumer insights to create unique and inspiring fragrances driving consumer preferences.\nOur fine fragrances focus on perfumes and colognes, creating global and local namesake brands, from high luxury to mass market, from market leading to ultra-niche products.\nOur consumer fragrances include three end-use categories of products:\n•\nFabric Care, including laundry detergents, fabric softeners and specialty laundry products;\n•\nHome Care, including household cleaners, dishwashing detergents and air fresheners; and\n•\nBody Care, including personal wash, hair care and toiletries products.\nFragrance Ingredients\n are natural and synthetic, and active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties, including competitors, for use in the preparation of compounds. While the principal role of our fragrance ingredients facilities is to support our fragrance compounds business, we utilize excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain fragrance ingredients to third parties, enabling us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of our supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers. We completed the divestiture of our Flavor Specialty Ingredients business on August 1, 2023. The Flavor Specialty Ingredients business previously comprised of natural flavor extracts, specialty botanical extracts, distillates, essential oils, citrus products, aroma chemicals and natural gums and resins, which are used for food, beverage and flavors, and are often sold directly to food and beverage manufacturers who use them in producing consumer products.\nPharma Solutions\nOur Pharma Solutions segment produces, among other things, a vast portfolio of cellulosics and seaweed-based pharmaceutical excipients, used to improve the functionality and delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including controlled or modified drug release formulations, and enabling the development of more effective pharmaceutical finished dosage formulations. Our excipients are used in prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. Our Pharma Solutions products also serve a variety of other specialty and industrial end-uses including coatings, inks, electronics, agriculture and consumer products. During March 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the Pharma Solutions business disposal group, that is primarily made up of most businesses within the Company’s existing Pharma Solutions reportable segment as well as certain adjacent businesses. During October 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its nitrocellulose business, which is within the Company’s existing Pharma Solutions reportable operating segment. Both transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.\nOrganization in 2025\nAs previously announced in 2024, starting January 1, 2025, our Nourish segment has been separated into two newly named business units, Taste and Food Ingredients. With small additional adjustments, our Flavors business, formerly part of Nourish, has been renamed Taste, and our Ingredients business, formerly part of Nourish, has been renamed Food Ingredients. Thus, \n 4\nTable of\n Contents\n \nstarting in the first quarter of 2025, our business segments will consist of Taste, Food Ingredients, Health & Biosciences, Scent, and, until the completion of the sale of the Pharma Solutions business disposal group, Pharma Solutions.\nConsumer Insights, Research and Product Development Process\nThe markets in which we compete require constant innovation to remain competitive. Consumer preferences tend to drive change in our markets, and as science evolves and sustainability continues to be a key factor to customers and consumers, we must continue to strengthen our research and development platforms and adapt our capabilities to provide differentiated products.\nConsumer Insights\nWe believe that the first step to creating an innovative and unique product experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer and emerging industry trends. By developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer through our consumer insight programs, we are better able to focus our research and development and creative efforts.\nOur consumer science, insight and marketing teams interpret trends, monitor product launches, analyze quantitative market data and conduct numerous consumer interviews annually.\nBased on this information, we develop innovative and proprietary programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer. We believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity, resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as for IFF.\nResearch and Development\nWe consider our research and development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and critical to our ability to provide differentiated products to our customers. We have strong product and application development pipelines built upon a global network that includes research and development, as well as regulatory and product stewardship capabilities.\nWe focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules, compounds, formulations and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products. Using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights programs and business unit needs, we strategically focus our resources around key research and development platforms that address or anticipate consumer needs or preferences. Our innovation-based platforms are aligned with key consumer insight-led growth themes: improving home and personal care, empowering wellbeing and healthy lives, transforming food systems and accelerating climate solutions. By aligning our capabilities and resources to these platforms, we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that our products can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have 894 granted U.S. patents, and 458 pending U.S. patent applications, as well as thousands of other granted patents and pending patent applications around the world. We have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful products around the world.\nOur principal basic research and development activities are located in Union Beach, New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware; Palo Alto, California; Brabrand, Denmark; and Leiden, The Netherlands. At those locations, our scientists and application engineers, while collaborating with our other research and development centers around the world, support the:\n•\ndiscovery of new materials;\n•\ndevelopment of new technologies, such as delivery systems;\n•\ncreation of new compounds; and\n•\nenhancement of existing ingredients and compounds.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 3,400 people globally in research and development activities (including innovation, creation and design activities).\nCreative Application\nThrough our global network of creative centers and application laboratories, we create or adapt the basic Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions products that we have developed in the research and development process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products. Our global creative teams consist of marketing, consumer science, consumer insights and technical application experts, from a wide range of cultures and nationalities. In close partnership with our customers’ product development groups, our creative teams create the experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their respective markets.\nNew product development is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers, who are in need of specific products for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our \n 5\nTable of\n Contents\n \nconsumer insights program. Our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal and relevance of our offerings. We use a collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers to perfect our offerings so they are ready to be included in the final consumer product.\nIn addition to creating new products, our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by moderating or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials enhancing their yield, or helping to increase or improve functionality of their formulations. This often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers.\nMost of our formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary assets. Our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent, trademark or license.\nSupply Chain\nWe strive to provide our customers with consistent and quality products on a timely and cost-effective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain, from raw material sourcing through manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory compliance and distribution.\nProcurement\nIn connection with the manufacture of our products, we use natural and synthetic ingredients. As of December 31, 2024, we purchased approximately 20,000 different raw materials sourced from an extensive network of domestic and international suppliers and distributors.\nNatural ingredients are derived from flowers, fruits and other botanical products, as well as from plant, animal and marine products, and commodity crops like wheat, corn and soy. They contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance, flavor, antioxidant properties and nutrition of the natural products. Natural products are purchased directly from farms or in processed and semi-processed forms. Some natural products are used in compounds in the state in which they are obtained and others are used after further processing. Natural products, together with various chemicals, are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes.\nIn order to ensure our supply of raw materials, achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers, we continue to focus on:\n•\npurchasing under contract with fixed or formula-based pricing for set time periods;\n•\nentering into hedging for raw materials we purchase that can be hedged against liquid commodity assets;\n•\nentering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies we would not otherwise have;\n•\nimplementing indexed pricing;\n•\nreducing the complexity of our formulations;\n•\nevaluating the profitability of whether to buy or make an ingredient;\n•\nsourcing from local countries with our own procurement professionals; and\n•\nperiodically assessing our supply base with a view towards greater cost efficiencies and improvements.\nManufacturing and Distribution\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 150 manufacturing facilities, creative centers and application laboratories located in approximately 40 different countries. Our major manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, The Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Slovenia, China, India, Ireland, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium and Singapore.\nOur supply chain initiatives are focused on increasing capacity and investing in key technologies. Within our more mature markets, we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as the implementation of new technologies. In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we develop relationships with third parties, including contract manufacturing organizations, that expand our access to the technologies, capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers.\nFor more detailed information about risks related to our supply chain, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” – \n“Supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, climate-change events, natural disasters, public health crises, tariffs and trade wars, and other events may adversely affect our business, our procurement of raw materials, and our development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products, and thus may impact our productivity, business and financial results.”\nSustainability \nIn 2021\n, we launched a refreshed and comprehensive sustainability roadmap, the ‘Do More Good Plan’ (\n“\nthe Plan\n”\n), which aligns with IFF’s strategy for long-term growth and value creation. Supported by a set of ambitious 2030 goals, the Plan \n 6\nTable of\n Contents\n \ncomprises four interconnected pillars that capture the areas where we believe we can have the greatest positive impact: Sustainable Solutions, Climate & Planetary Health, Equity & Wellbeing, Transparency & Accountability.\nSustainable Solutions\nWe deliver solutions that seek to transform industries and empower our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives, beginning with our commitment to responsible sourcing and then leveraging our research and development program to drive environmentally and socially-conscious innovation. \nClimate & Planetary Health\nOur science-based approach to environmental sustainability across our own operations includes investing in energy-efficient systems and expanding our use of renewable energy as we work to achieve our ambition for net zero greenhouse gas emissions. We partner across our value chain to reduce our footprint by advancing our climate action strategies, reducing our water use and striving for zero waste to landfill. \nEquity & Wellbeing\nWe are advancing our commitment to people and communities by ensuring an equitable and inclusive environment for all employees, while continuously improving our safety program by striving for an injury-free workplace and achieving world-class safety performance.\nTransparency & Accountability\nConducting our business with the highest integrity is essential to fulfilling our Do More Good vision. Our robust and transparent corporate governance framework is designed to ensure compliance with our policies, as well as with laws and regulations. Our employees are expected to act ethically, speak up and seek advice when in doubt, and our leaders are accountable for upholding our values and advancing toward our goals.\nAcross these four pillars, the Company continued to achieve notable recognitions in 2024. For example, we qualified as a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, North America, for the fifth consecutive year, a best-in-class benchmark for investors who recognize that sustainable business practices are critical to generating long-term shareholder value. This distinction validates IFF’s leadership position in sustainability performance and underscores our commitment to executing on key sustainability priorities. We were also awarded the 2024 EcoVadis Platinum sustainability rating for the fourth consecutive time, placing IFF among the top 1% of companies assessed. In addition, we continue to support transparency and accountability through our submission to CDP Climate Change, Water Security and Forests. IFF continues to be listed in the FTSE4Good Index series as well as being named as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek.\nGovernmental Regulation \nWe develop, produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions around the world and are subject to federal, regional and local legislation and regulations in various countries. Our products, which among other industries, are intended for use in food, beverage, pharmaceutical and dietary supplements, home and personal care, and feed, are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards and environmental laws and regulations. We in turn are required to meet strict standards which, in recent years, have become increasingly stringent and affect both existing as well as new products. While the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations leads to higher overall capital expenditure, which can be significant in certain periods, we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures necessary to comply with such laws and regulations. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, compliance has not had, and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on capital expenditure, earnings or competitive position.\nOur products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate. These agencies include (1) the Food and Drug Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors, pharmaceutical excipients and other ingredients in consumer products, (2) the Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities, as well as fragrance products (including encapsulation systems), (3) the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing, research laboratories and creative centers, (4) local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs, (5) the Drug Enforcement Administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations, (6) the Chemical Registration/Notification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in, or transport to, the various countries in which we manufacture and/or market our products, and (7) the U.S. Department of Agriculture and equivalent international authorities with respect to, among other things, labeling of consumer products. We have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries, such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations in the European Union, as well as similar regulations in other countries.\n 7\nTable of\n Contents\n \nIn addition, we are subject to various rules relating to health, work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate. Our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination. In recent years, there has been an increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards, and the costs of compliance have risen significantly, a trend we expect will continue in the future.\nFor more detailed information about risks related to governmental regulation applicable to the Company, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” – \n“If we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.”\nCompetition\nThe markets for our products are part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products. Our products are sold principally to manufacturers of dairy, meat, beverages, snacks, savory, sweet, baked goods, grain processors and other foods, personal care products, soaps and detergents, cleaning products, perfumes, dietary supplements, food protection, infant, elderly and animal nutrition, functional food, pharmaceutical and oral care products.\nThe global market for our products has expanded, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, and an increase in the variety of, consumer products.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive. Our main competitors consist of (1) other large global companies, such as Givaudan, DSM-Firmenich, Symrise, Kerry, ADM, and Novonesis, (2) mid-sized companies, (3) numerous regional and local manufacturers and (4) consumer product companies who may develop their own competing products.\nWe believe that our ability to create products with the sustainability related attributes customers expect and compete successfully in the various sub-market is based on:\n•\nour in-depth understanding of consumers,\n•\nvertical integration,\n•\ninnovation and technological advances from our research and development activities and, as applicable, our scientists,\n•\nour ability to tailor products to customers’ needs,\n•\nour ability to manufacture products on a global scale, and\n•\nbroad-based regulatory capabilities.\nIn certain industries, large multi-national customers and, increasingly, mid-sized customers, may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists,” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products. To compete more successfully, we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs, provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists.”\nPrivate label manufacturers, mostly medium-sized, local or small food manufacturers, constitute a growing segment in certain markets where we are active. Over the last decade, with the strengthening of supermarket chains, online platforms and growing consumer price consciousness, consumption of private label products has grown at a faster rate than the brand food industry rate. We believe that new business opportunities will continue to arise from these clients as they are increasing their demand for products that are similar to existing products in the market, distinctive premium products, as well as more innovative products.\nOur People\nThe success of our business is built on our talented employees. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 22,400 employees worldwide, of whom approximately 24% are employed in the United States. Our workforce plans and talent management programs support our employees to best deliver the business strategy and ensure their development and engagement.\nCulture and Values\nOur culture is based on our four corporate values of passion, partnership, persistence and principled, and the expression of these values can be seen and felt throughout our history. Our employees appreciate that they contribute to products that touch and enhance the lives of millions of people around the world. Our robust culture ambassador and colleague community program continues to engage a broad portion of the IFF community in building common identity and shared purpose and strengthen engagement and motivation by providing programming on IFF values and providing recognition of individuals who exemplify them.\n 8\nTable of\n Contents\n \nIFF strives to have a culture on inclusion and belonging where all employees can thrive. Our programs focus on inclusive talent processes, employee experiences, and external engagement. In 2024 we continued to be recognized by external parties such as EDGE, DisabilityIN and Workplace Pride, and employee sentiment on inclusion increased to 82% (compared with 80% in 2023).\nLeadership and Development\nOur leadership development efforts empower employees to become forward-looking, inspiring and capable decision-makers, agents of change and great leaders. A full portfolio of proprietary leadership development programs and an overarching talent management system is in place to support growth of leaders and at all levels. To cultivate our employees’ talent and build sustainable long-lasting careers at IFF, we provide tools that enable our employees to envision their career journeys in the form of articulated career “ladders” and “frameworks”. We offer corresponding development opportunities to include specialized courses for employees globally by partnering with leading institutions and universities to help provide the latest training and development offerings at all levels. We also offer to our employees an extensive library of on-demand courses and materials on leadership, management and professional skills development. Those learning resources are integrated into our human capital platform, allowing managers and employees to establish digitalized learning plans that are ultimately captured as a part of their employee profile. Further, those offerings complement our talent acquisition strategy and organized and personalized feedback process, supported by industry-leading assessment tools.\nOccupational Health & Safety\nEmployee safety is one of the cornerstones of our business. Our occupational health and safety management system requires and encourages employees and supervised contractors at sites globally to uphold IFF’s protocols, report any incidents and suggest improvements that improve the safety of work sites. Our safety management system is based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards which apply to all of our sites in conjunction with any local regulations. To work toward a safer workplace, we have put in place a set of protocols and programs related to three areas of focus: (a) safety governance (setting and updating comprehensive safety policies and procedures), (b) safety training of employees based on IFF policies and local requirements, and (c) safety culture characterized by awareness and communication.\nAvailability of Reports\nWe make available free of charge on or through the “Investors” link on our website, www.iff.com, all materials that we file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such materials with, or furnishing them to, the SEC.\nThe SEC maintains an Internet website, www.sec.gov, that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\nA copy of our By-Laws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Codes of Conduct, and the charters of the Audit Committee, Human Capital & Compensation Committee, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee and Innovation Committee of the Board of Directors are posted on the “Investors” section of our website, www.iff.com.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 521 West 57th Street, New York, New York 10019 and 200 Powder Mill Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19803.\nExecutive Officers of Registrant\nBelow is a list of the executive officers of the Company and other significant employees who are members of our Executive Leadership Team as of February 28, 2025.\n 9\nTable of\n Contents\n \nName\nAge\nPosition\nJ.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n(UNLESS INDICATED OTHERWISE, DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\nOVERVIEW\nCompany Background\nWe are organized into four reportable operating segments: Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions.\nOur Nourish segment consists of an innovative and broad portfolio of natural-based ingredients to enhance nutritional value, texture and functionality in a wide range of beverage, dairy, bakery, confectionery and culinary applications and consists of Ingredients and Flavors.\nOur Health & Biosciences segment consists of the development and production of an advanced biotechnology-derived portfolio of enzymes, food cultures, probiotics and specialty ingredients for food and non-food applications. Among many other applications, this biotechnology-driven portfolio includes cultures for use in fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese and fermented beverages, probiotic strains, many with documented clinical health claims for use as dietary supplements and through industrial fermentation the production of enzymes and microorganisms that provide product and process performance benefits to household detergents, animal feed, ethanol production and brewing. Health & Biosciences is comprised of Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes, Home & Personal Care, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing.\n 32\nTable of\n Contents\n \nOur Scent segment creates fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and best-known household and personal care products. Consumer insights, science and creativity are at the heart of our Scent business, and, along with our unique portfolio of natural and synthetic ingredients, global footprint, innovative technologies and know-how, and customer intimacy, we believe make us a market leader in scent products. The Scent segment is comprised of Fragrance Compounds and Fragrance Ingredients. We completed the divestiture of our Cosmetic Ingredients business, previously within the Scent segment, on April 2, 2024.\nOur Pharma Solutions segment produces, among other things, a vast portfolio of cellulosics and seaweed-based pharmaceutical excipients, used to improve the functionality and delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including controlled or modified drug release formulations, and enabling the development of more effective pharmaceutical finished dosage formulations. Our excipients are used in prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. Our Pharma Solutions products also serve a variety of other specialty and industrial end-uses including coatings, inks, electronics, agriculture and consumer products. During March 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the Pharma Solutions business disposal group, that is primarily made up of most businesses within the Company’s existing Pharma Solutions reportable segment as well as certain adjacent businesses. During October 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its nitrocellulose business, which is within the Company’s existing Pharma Solutions reportable operating segment. Both transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.\n2025 Segment Reorganization \nAs previously announced in 2024, effective January 1, 2025, our Nourish segment has been restructured into two newly designated operating segments: Taste and Food Ingredients. With additional minor adjustments, our Flavors business, previously part of Nourish, has been renamed Taste, and our Ingredients business, previously part of Nourish, has been renamed Food Ingredients. Consequently, starting in the first quarter of 2025, our business segments will be as follows: Taste, Food Ingredients, Health & Biosciences, Scent, and Pharma Solutions, until the completion of the sale of the Pharma Solutions business disposal group. \nFinancial Measures — Currency Neutral\nOur financial results include the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We provide currency neutral calculations in this report to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations. We calculate currency neutral numbers by translating current year invoiced sale amounts at the exchange rates used for the corresponding prior year period. We use currency neutral results in our analysis of subsidiary and/or segment performance. We also use currency neutral numbers when analyzing our performance against our competitors.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nDuring 2024, we determined that the carrying value of the Pharma Solutions disposal group exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $64 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDuring 2023, we determined that the carrying value of the Nourish reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $2.623 billion in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring 2022, we determined that the carrying value of the Health & Biosciences reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.250 billion in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSee \n“Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” and \nNote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For more detailed information about risks related to impairment of goodwill, refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” – \n“Any impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our profitability.”\nImpact related to the Israel-Hamas War\nWe maintain operations in Israel and, additionally, export products to customers in Israel from operations outside the region. We will continue to evaluate the current events and any potential impacts related to this matter, but we do not expect there to be a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn 2024 and 2023, total sales to Israeli customers were approximately 1% of total sales.\nImpact related to the Russia-Ukraine War\n 33\nTable of\n Contents\n \nWe maintain operations in both Russia and Ukraine and, additionally, export products to customers in Russia and Ukraine from operations outside the region. In response to the events in Ukraine, we have limited the production and supply of ingredients in and to Russia to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine.\nIn 2024 and 2023, total sales to Russian customers were approximately 1% of total sales.\nIn 2024 and 2023, total sales to Ukrainian customers were both less than 1% of total sales.\nWe have a reserve of approximately $2 million related to expected credit losses on receivables from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. During 2022, we also recorded a charge of $120 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets in Russia. See Note 1, Note 11 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFor more detailed information about risks related to the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war, refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” – \n“Supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, climate-change events, natural disasters, public health crises, tariffs and trade wars, and other events may adversely affect our business, our procurement of raw materials, and our development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products, and thus may impact our productivity, business and financial results.”\n2024 Financial Performance Overview\nFor a reconciliation between reported and adjusted figures, please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.\nSales\nSales in 2024 of $11.484 billion remained flat compared to sales of $11.479 billion in 2023. On a currency neutral basis, sales in 2024 increased 3% compared to 2023. Exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact on net sales in 2024 of 3%. The effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region, depending upon the mix of sales priced in U.S. dollars as compared to other currencies. On a comparable basis, currency neutral sales increased 6% driven by volume increases across various business lines. Comparable portfolio results exclude the impact of divestitures of the portion of the Savory Solutions business, Sonarome business, Flavors & Essences UK business (“F&E UK”), Flavors Specialty Ingredients (“FSI”) business, and Cosmetic Ingredients business (“change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures”), which was approximately $360 million.\nA key factor for commercial success is our inclusion on strategic customers’ core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to expand and win new business. We are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers. In 2024, no customer accounted for 10% or more of sales.\nGross Profit\nGross profit in 2024 increased $443 million, or 12% on a reported basis, to $4.124 billion (35.9% of sales) compared to $3.681 billion (32.1% of sales) in the 2023 period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by volume increases and productivity gains, offset in part by the effect of exchange rate variations and the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures of $133 million.\n 34\nTable of\n Contents\n \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nNet sales\n$\n11,484 \n$\n11,479 \n$\n12,440 \n— \n%\n(8)\n%\nCost of sales\n7,360 \n7,798 \n8,289 \n(6)\n%\n(6)\n%\nGross profit\n4,124 \n3,681 \n4,151 \n12 \n%\n(11)\n%\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses\n671 \n636 \n603 \n6 \n%\n5 \n%\nSelling and administrative (S&A) expenses\n1,995 \n1,787 \n1,768 \n12 \n%\n1 \n%\nRestructuring and other charges\n29 \n68 \n12 \n(57)\n%\nNMF\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles\n610 \n680 \n727 \n(10)\n%\n(6)\n%\nImpairment of goodwill\n64 \n2,623 \n2,250 \n(98)\n%\n17 \n%\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n— \n— \n120 \nNMF\n(100)\n%\nGains on sale of assets\n(11)\n(3)\n(3)\n267 \n%\n— \n%\nOperating profit (loss)\n766 \n(2,110)\n(1,326)\n(136)\n%\n59 \n%\nInterest expense\n305 \n380 \n336 \n(20)\n%\n13 \n%\n(Gains) losses on business disposals\n(346)\n23 \n(11)\nNMF\n— \n%\nLoss on assets classified as held for sale\n347 \n— \n— \nNMF\n— \n%\nOther expense (income), net\n182 \n5 \n(26)\nNMF\n(119)\n%\nIncome (loss) before taxes\n278 \n(2,518)\n(1,625)\n(111)\n%\n55 \n%\nProvision for income taxes\n31 \n45 \n239 \n(31)\n%\n(81)\n%\nNet income (loss)\n247 \n(2,563)\n(1,864)\n(110)\n%\n38 \n%\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\n4 \n4 \n7 \n— \n%\n(43)\n%\nNet income (loss) attributable to IFF shareholders\n$\n243 \n$\n(2,567)\n$\n(1,871)\n(109)\n%\n37 \n%\nNet income (loss) per share — basic and diluted\n$\n0.95 \n$\n(10.05)\n$\n(7.32)\n(109)\n%\n37 \n%\nGross margin\n35.9 \n%\n32.1 \n%\n33.4 \n%\nNMF\n(130)\nbps\nR&D as a percentage of sales\n5.8 \n%\n5.5 \n%\n4.8 \n%\n30 \nbps\n70 \nbps\nS&A as a percentage of sales\n17.4 \n%\n15.6 \n%\n14.2 \n%\n180 \nbps\n140 \nbps\nOperating margin\n6.7 \n%\n(18.4)\n%\n(10.7)\n%\nNMF\nNMF\nEffective tax rate\n11.2 \n%\n(1.8)\n%\n(14.7)\n%\nNMF\nNMF\nSegment net sales\nNourish\n$\n5,871 \n$\n6,060 \n$\n6,829 \n(3)\n%\n(11)\n%\nHealth & Biosciences\n2,212 \n2,081 \n2,339 \n6 \n%\n(11)\n%\nScent\n2,440 \n2,393 \n2,301 \n2 \n%\n4 \n%\nPharma Solutions\n961 \n945 \n971 \n2 \n%\n(3)\n%\nConsolidated\n$\n11,484 \n$\n11,479 \n$\n12,440 \n— \n%\n(8)\n%\n_______________________\nNMF: Not meaningful\nCost of sales includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses.

On a currency neutral basis, Nourish sales remained flat in 2024 compared to the 2023 period as exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact. On a comparable basis, currency neutral sales increased 4% driven by volume increases across all business units. Comparable portfolio results exclude the impact of the divestitures of the portion of the Savory Solutions business, Sonarome business and F&E UK business with an impact of approximately $244 million.\nHealth & Biosciences\nHealth & Biosciences sales in 2024 increased $131 million, or 6% on a reported basis, to $2.212 billion compared to $2.081 billion in 2023. On a currency neutral basis, Health & Biosciences sales increased 8% in 2024 compared to the 2023 period as exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact. Performance in the Health & Biosciences operating segment was driven by volume increases across various business units and price increases across Cultures & Food Enzymes and Grain Processing business units.\nScent\nScent sales in 2024 increased $47 million, or 2% on a reported basis, to $2.440 billion compared to $2.393 billion in 2023. On a currency neutral basis, Scent sales increased 7% in 2024 compared to the 2023 period as exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact. On a comparable basis, currency neutral sales increased 12% driven by price increases in the Fragrance Compounds business unit and volume increases across all business units. Comparable portfolio results exclude the impact of the divestitures of the FSI business and Cosmetic Ingredients business, with an impact of approximately $116 million.\nPharma Solutions\n 36\nTable of\n Contents\n \nPharma Solutions sales in 2024 increased $16 million, or 2% on a reported basis, to $961 million compared to $945 million in 2023. On a currency neutral basis, Pharma Solutions sales also increased 2% in 2024 compared to the 2023 period as the impact of exchange rate variations was flat. Performance in the Pharma Solutions operating segment was driven by volume growth in industrial markets.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales decreased $438 million to $7.360 billion (64.1% of sales) in 2024 compared to $7.798 billion (67.9% of sales) in 2023. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures which was approximately $227 million, lower raw material costs and manufacturing expenses, lower unfavorable manufacturing absorption compared to the prior year period, increased productivity compared to the prior year period, offset in part by volume increases.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nR&D expenses increased $35 million to $671 million (5.8% of sales) in 2024 compared to $636 million (5.5% of sales) in 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily driven by an increase in incentive compensation expense, offset in part by the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures and the effect of exchange rate variations.\nSelling and Administrative (S&A) Expenses\nS&A expenses increased $208 million to $1.995 billion (17.4% of sales) in 2024 compared to $1.787 billion (15.6% of sales) in 2023. The increase in S&A expenses was primarily driven by an increase in incentive compensation expense, professional fees, legal fees and provisions incurred for the ongoing investigations of the fragrance businesses, and divestiture related costs incurred in preparation for the sale of the Pharma Solutions disposal group, offset in part by the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring and other charges decreased to $29 million in 2024 compared to $68 million in 2023. The 2024 amounts represent costs primarily related to the IFF Productivity Program and the 2023 amounts represent severance costs primarily incurred as part of the 2023 Restructuring Program. See Note 5 for additional information.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\nAmortization expenses decreased to $610 million in 2024 compared to $680 million in 2023. The decrease in amortization expense was primarily driven by the reduction in intangible assets as a result of the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures and intangible assets of the Pharma Solutions disposal group being classified as “held for sale,” and therefore no longer recognizing amortization expense on those intangible assets. See Note 4 for additional information.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nThe impairment of goodwill was $64 million in 2024 compared to $2.623 billion in 2023, which was related to the Pharma Solutions disposal group and Nourish reporting units, respectively. See Note 1, Note 4, and Note 12 for additional information.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $75 million to $305 million in 2024 compared to $380 million in 2023. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower debt outstanding. See Note 14 for additional information.\n(Gains) Losses on Business Disposals\n(Gains) losses on business disposals increased to $(346) million in 2024 compared to $23 million in 2023. The net gain on business disposals in 2024 primarily relates to the gain recognized on the sale of the Cosmetic Ingredients business, offset in part by the loss recognized on the sale of the F&E UK business. The loss in 2023 primarily relates to the sale of the FSI business, the sale of a portion of the Savory Solutions business, and liquidation of a business in Russia for the sale of the portion of the Savory Solutions business. See Note 4 for additional information.\nLoss on Assets Classified as Held for Sale\nLoss on assets classified as held for sale was $347 million in 2024. This related to assets classified as held for sale for the Pharma Solutions disposal group and the portion of the Savory Solutions business in Turkey. See Note 4 for additional information.\n 37\nTable of\n Contents\n \nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net, increased $177 million to $182 million in 2024 compared to $5 million in 2023. $153 million of increased expense was driven by increased pension-related expense, $130 million of which was due to a settlement loss that was recognized upon termination of the International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. Pension Plan in 2024. See Note 8 and Note 9 for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate in 2024 was 11.2% compared to (1.8)% in 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income, changes in the mix of earnings, the tax impact of business divestitures and certain non-recurring tax benefits. See Note 10 for additional information.\nSegment Adjusted Operating EBITDA Results\nThe Company uses Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for internal reporting and performance measurement purposes. Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA is defined as Income (Loss) Before Taxes before depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, restructuring and other charges and certain items that are not related to recurring operations. Our determination of reportable segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities within each segment and corresponds to the manner in which our Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment.

Comparable portfolio results exclude the impact of the divestitures of the FSI business and Cosmetic Ingredients business, with an impact of approximately $45 million.\nPharma Solutions Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA\nPharma Solutions Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA increased $10 million, or 5% on a reported basis, to $209 million (21.7% of segment sales) in 2024 from $199 million (21.1% of segment sales) in 2023. On a comparable basis, Pharma Solutions Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA increased 5% in 2024 compared to 2023 led by primarily volume increases and productivity gains.\n2023 IN COMPARISON TO 2022\nFor a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $471 million, inclusive of $2 million currently in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, at December 31, 2024 compared to $735 million, inclusive of $26 million in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, at December 31, 2023 and of this balance, the majority was held outside the United States. Cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the United States.\nEffective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy. We regularly repatriate cash from our non-U.S. subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the U.S. As we repatriate these funds to the U.S., we will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes during the period when such repatriation occurs. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, we had a deferred tax liability of approximately $154 million for the effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S., attributable to various non-U.S. subsidiaries. There is no deferred tax liability associated with non-U.S. subsidiaries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings to fund local operations and/or capital projects.\nCash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities in 2024 were $1.070 billion, or 9.3% of sales, compared to $1.439 billion, or 12.5% of sales, in 2023. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in working capital, largely related to trade receivables and inventories including amounts held for sale, offset in part by accounts payable and higher cash earnings, excluding the impact of non-cash adjustments.\nCash Flows Provided By Investing Activities\nCash flows provided by investing activities in 2024 were $326 million compared to $574 million in 2023. The decrease in cash flows from investing activities from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by lower net proceeds received from business divestitures compared to the prior year period, offset in part by decreased additions to property, plant and equipment.\n 40\nTable of\n Contents\n \nWe have evaluated and re-prioritized our capital projects and expect that capital spending in 2025 will be approximately 6% of sales.\nCash Flows Used In Financing Activities\nCash flows used in financing activities in 2024 were $1.606 billion compared to $1.851 billion in 2023. The decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by lower dividends and higher repayments in the prior year period of commercial paper and amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, offset in part by increased repayments of long-term debt.\nWe paid dividends totaling $514 million and $826 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash dividend declared per share in 2024 and 2023 was $1.60 and $3.24, respectively.\nOur capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating. We will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long-term plans. We are also committed to maintaining our history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our Board of Directors at its discretion based on various factors.\nCapital Resources \nOperating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, cash proceeds generated from planned business divestitures and availability under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs, including our debt service requirements, for the foreseeable future. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. See Note 14 for additional information.\nTerm Loan and Revolving Credit Facility\nOur credit agreements contain various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to credit adjusted EBITDA in respect of the previous 12-month period.\nOur Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to Term SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10% per annum or, in the case of euro-denominated loans, the Euro interbank offered rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our public debt rating. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.\nBased on the amendments entered into on September 19, 2023 for our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, we were provided with a financial covenant relief period through December 31, 2025, or such earlier date on which the Company elects to terminate such period, by providing that during the Term Loan Covenant Relief Period and Revolver Covenant Relief Period, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio shall not exceed as of the end of the fiscal quarter for the period of the four fiscal quarters then ended: (i) 5.25x for any fiscal quarter ending on or before March 31, 2024, (ii) 4.75x for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, (iii) 4.50x for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, (iv) 4.25x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before March 31, 2025, (v) 4.00x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before September 30, 2025 and (vi) 3.75x for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025. During the Term Loan Covenant Relief Period and the Revolver Covenant Relief Period, the amendments prohibit us from (i) effecting share repurchases, (ii) declaring and paying dividends in cash on common stock in excess of $0.81 per share per fiscal quarter (for an aggregate amount of $3.24 per fiscal year) and (iii) creating liens to secure debt in excess of the greater of $300 million and 3.65% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement), in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth therein.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $2 billion Revolving Credit Facility. The amount that we are able to draw down under the Revolving Credit Facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. As of December 31, 2024, our available capacity was $922 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit agreements.\nDebt Covenants\nAt December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit agreements, including the net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA\n(1)\n ratio. At December 31, 2024, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA\n(1)\n ratio was 3.84 to 1.0 as defined by the credit facility agreements, which is below the relevant level provided by our financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. The most comparable GAAP measure is the total debt to net income ratio, which was 37.06 to 1.0 at December 31, 2024.\n_______________________ \n 41\nTable of\n Contents\n \n(1)\nCredit adjusted EBITDA and net debt, which are non-GAAP measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. In this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to credit adjusted EBITDA and net debt used by other companies. Reconciliations of credit adjusted EBITDA to net income and net debt to total debt are as follows:\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nNet income\n$\n243 \nInterest expense\n305 \nIncome taxes\n31 \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,015 \nSpecified items\n(1)\n434 \nNon-cash items\n(2)\n197 \nCredit Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,225 \n_______________________ \n(1)\nSpecified items consisted of restructuring and other charges, impairment of goodwill, acquisition, divestiture and integration costs, strategic initiatives costs, regulatory costs and other costs that are not related to recurring operations.\n(2)\nNon-cash items consisted of losses (gains) on sale of assets, losses (gains) on business disposals, losses on assets classified as held for sale, pension settlement losses, and stock-based compensation.\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal debt\n(1)\n$\n9,005 \nAdjustments:\nCash and cash equivalents\n(2)\n471 \nNet debt\n$\n8,534 \n_______________________\n(1)\nTotal debt used for the calculation of net debt consisted of short-term debt, long-term debt, short-term finance lease obligations and long-term finance lease obligations.\n(2)\nCash and cash equivalents included approximately $2 million currently in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $8.478 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding in senior unsecured notes, with $828 million principal amount denominated in EUR and $7.650 billion principal amount denominated in USD. The notes bear effective interest rates ranging from 1.22% per year to 5.12% per year, with maturities from October 1, 2025 to December 1, 2050. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Contingencies\nSee Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to Other Contingencies\n.\nOther Commitments\nCompliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2024 and 2023, we spent approximately $32 million and $23 million on capital projects and $136 million and $139 million in operating expenses and governmental charges, respectively, for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company believes its balances of cash and cash equivalents, which totaled approximately $471 million as of December 31, 2024, inclusive of approximately $2 million currently in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and access to the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital \n 42\nTable of\n Contents\n \nreturn program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nBorrowings and Interest on Borrowings\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $8.891 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with approximately $1.413 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total approximately $2.777 billion, with approximately $256 million payable within 12 months.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no Commercial Paper outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our various borrowing facilities.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain corporate offices, manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, and certain transportation and office equipment. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of approximately $782 million, with approximately $117 million payable within 12 months. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our various lease arrangements.\nPension and Other Postretirement Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had pension funding obligations of approximately $445 million, with approximately $40 million payable within 12 months. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our retirement plans.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had postretirement obligations of approximately $40 million, with approximately $4 million payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company has various purchase commitments that include agreements for raw material procurement and contractual capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had purchase commitment obligations of approximately $367 million, with approximately $206 million payable within 12 months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.\nThose areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:\nBusiness Combinations\nFrom time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attract new customers. When we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business, we apply the acquisition method described in ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. In accordance with GAAP, the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition forward.\nWe allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. If during the measurement period (a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date) we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period in which the amounts are determined.\nSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangibles and fixed assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically engage third-party valuation specialists, who work under the direction of management, to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired.\n 43\nTable of\n Contents\n \nThe fair value estimates are based on available historical information, future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.\nWe typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates, discount rates and profitability), royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method, customer attrition rates, product obsolescence factors, a brand’s relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment. All of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., trademarks, product formulas, non-compete agreements and customer relationships) are expected to have finite useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold.\nThe costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives. The value of residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note. For acquired intangible assets, the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks, product formulas, and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned.\nThe Periodic Assessment of Potential Impairment of Goodwill and Held for Sale Balances\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have goodwill of approximately $9.080 billion. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of November 30 every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded.\nWe identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components. Components within a segment that have similar economic characteristics have been aggregated as a single reporting unit. We determined that we have five reporting units under the Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions segments: (1) Nourish, (2) Fragrance Compounds, (3) Fragrance Ingredients, (4) Health & Biosciences and (5) Pharma Solutions. Note that the entire goodwill balance related to Pharma Solutions has been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024.\nFor the annual impairment test as of November 30, 2024, the Company performed quantitative impairment tests by comparing the fair value of the reporting units with their carrying amounts.\nWe assessed the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determined the fair value by using a discounted cash flow method at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the projected future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value. We used the most current actual and forecasted operating data available. Key estimates and assumptions used in these valuations include revenue growth rates, gross margins, adjusted operating EBITDA margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates.\nIn performing the quantitative impairment test, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values and determined that there was no further impairment of goodwill in these reporting units as of November 30, 2024. Based on the quantitative impairment test performed, we determined that the Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Fragrance Compounds and Fragrance Ingredients reporting units had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 22%, 18%, 169% and 37%, respectively. While we believe that the assumptions used in the impairment test were reasonable, changes in key assumptions, including lower revenue growth, adjusted operating EBITDA margin, terminal growth rates or increase in discount rates could result in a future impairment. Such impairment could have a material effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets.\nAs discussed in Note 4, the classification of the Pharma Solutions disposal group as held for sale was considered an event or change in circumstance which required an assessment of the existing Pharma Solutions reporting unit. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company performed a pre-classification goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of the Pharma Solutions reporting unit exceeded the carrying value. Goodwill allocated to the Pharma Solutions reporting unit was $1.2 billion before classification of the disposal group as held for sale. For the pre-classification impairment assessment, we estimated the fair value of the Pharma Solutions reporting unit based upon the fair value of the held for sale disposal group as described below and the estimated fair value of the portion of the Pharma Solutions reporting unit that was not classified as held for sale (“remaining Pharma Solutions reporting unit”). \n 44\nTable of\n Contents\n \nThe Company then performed a post-classification goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value was less than the carrying value of the Pharma Solutions disposal group. As such, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $64 million which is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. \nThe Company also performed a goodwill impairment test of the remaining Pharma Solutions reporting unit and determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying value. For the impairment assessments, we estimated the fair value of the remaining Pharma Solutions reporting unit based upon the estimated sale proceeds we would expect to receive in a transaction between willing market participants.\nThe Company engaged an independent third party to determine the fair value of the assets held for sale as of the initial held for sale classification date on May 1, 2024 and each subsequent balance sheet date, based upon the sale price including earnouts expected to be received from the buyer. The fair value of the earnouts were based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value estimation uses Level 3 unobservable inputs as categorized within the ASC Topic 820 fair value hierarchy. This method considers the terms and conditions of the earnouts as described in the relevant transaction agreements, our best estimates of forecasted EBITDA for the earnout periods as applicable, and assumptions such as risk-adjusted discount rate, EBITDA volatility, counterparty discount rate and risk-free rate. The simulation consists first in risk-adjusting the EBITDA projections using a risk-adjusted discount rate and then simulating a range of EBITDAs over the applicable period using the estimate of EBITDA volatility. The fair value of the earnouts are estimated as the present value of the potential range of payouts averaged across the range of simulated EBITDAs using the counterparty discount rate. A 10% increase or decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration would not have a material impact to the impairment charge. \nDuring 2023, based on the quantitative impairment test using the income approach, we determined that the carrying value of the Nourish reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.623 billion in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring 2022, based on the quantitative impairment test using the income approach, we determined that the carrying value of the Health & Biosciences reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.250 billion in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSee Note 12 \nto the Consolidated Financial Statements \nfor additional information.\nEffective January 1, 2025, our Nourish segment has been restructured into two newly designated operating segments: Taste and Food Ingredients. This change in management reporting necessitates the reallocation of goodwill between the two reporting units and the performance of a goodwill impairment test both prior to and subsequent to the change. While we have not yet completed our goodwill and long-lived assets impairment assessments required by this internal reporting structure, we anticipate incurring a material impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, estimated to be in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion.\nThe Periodic Assessment of Potential Impairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. An estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques, including a discounted estimate of future cash flows.\nThere was no impairment recorded of long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Due to the uncertainties related to our operations in Russia and Ukraine, we recorded a charge of approximately $120 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets in Russia \nin the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information\n.\nNew Accounting Standards\n See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K, including: (i) currency neutral metrics, (ii) comparable portfolio metrics and (iii) adjusted operating EBITDA and adjusted operating EBITDA margin. We also provide the non-GAAP measure net debt solely for the purpose of providing information on the Company’s compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements. Our non-GAAP financial measures are defined below.\n 45\nTable of\n Contents\n \nThese non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ calculation of such metrics.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA and adjusted operating EBITDA margin exclude depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other (expense) income, net, restructuring and other charges and certain items unrelated to recurring operations such as impairment of goodwill, gains (losses) on business disposals, loss on assets classified as held for sale, acquisition, divestiture and integration costs, strategic initiatives costs, regulatory costs and other costs that are not related to recurring operations.\nNet debt to credit adjusted EBITDA is the leverage ratio used in our credit agreement and defined as net debt divided by credit adjusted EBITDA. However, as credit adjusted EBITDA for these purposes was calculated in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement, it may differ from the calculation used for adjusted operating EBITDA.\nCautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nStatements in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts or information, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
