BUSINESS\nOverview\nInvitation Homes is a leading owner and operator of single-family homes for lease, offering residents high-quality homes in sought-after neighborhoods across the United States. As of December 31, 2024, we wholly own 85,138 homes for lease, jointly own 7,622 homes for lease, and provide professional third-party property and asset management services for an additional 17,678 homes, all of which are primarily located in 16 core markets across the country. These homes help meet the needs of a growing share of Americans who prefer the ease of a leasing lifestyle over the burden of owning a home. We provide our residents access to updated homes with features they value, as well as close proximity to jobs and access to good schools. The continued demand for our product proves that the choice and flexibility we offer are attractive to many people.\nWe operate in markets with strong demand drivers, high barriers to entry, and high rent growth potential, primarily in the Western United States, Florida, and the Southeast United States. Through disciplined market and asset selection, as well as through strategic mergers and acquisitions, we designed our wholly and jointly owned portfolios to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated. Since our founding in 2012, we have built a proven, vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire, renovate, lease, maintain, and manage both the homes we own and those we manage on behalf of others. \nThe portfolio of homes we own average approximately 1,880 square feet with three to four bedrooms and two bathrooms, appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than a typical multifamily resident. We invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs, reduce ongoing maintenance costs, and drive resident demand. \nAt Invitation Homes, we are committed to creating a better way to live and to being a force for positive change, while at the same time advancing efforts that make our company more innovative and our processes more sustainable. Sustainability is an important part of our strategic business objectives and is critical to our long-term success. \nOur commitment to high-touch customer service continuously enhances residents’ living experiences and provides homes where individuals and families can thrive. Each aspect of our operations — whether in our corporate headquarters or field offices located in our 16 core markets — is driven by a resident-centric model. Our associates take our values seriously and work hard every day to honor the trust our residents have placed in us to provide clean, safe, and functional homes for them and their loved ones. In turn, we focus on ensuring that our associates are fairly compensated and that we provide a culture that values respect, opportunity, and belonging. We also place a strong emphasis on the impact we have in our communities and to the environment in general, and we continue to develop programs that demonstrate those commitments. In addition, we ensure that we operate under strong, well-defined governance practices and adhere to the highest ethical standards at all times. \nHistory\nThrough certain of the six holding entities that owned our business prior to our initial public offering (the “IH Holding Entities”), we commenced operations in 2012. On January 31, 2017, we effected certain reorganization transactions that resulted in INVH LP holding, directly or indirectly, all of the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Manager and the full portfolio of homes owned by the IH Holding Entities. As a result of the reorganization transactions, INVH LP became a consolidated subsidiary of INVH. A wholly owned subsidiary of INVH, Invitation Homes OP GP LLC (the “General Partner”), serves as INVH LP’s sole general partner. \nInvitation Homes Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated in Delaware on October 4, 2016. On February 6, 2017, Invitation Homes Inc. changed its jurisdiction of incorporation to Maryland and completed an initial public offering of its shares of common stock (the “IPO”).\nAs of December 31, 2024, INVH owns a 99.7% partnership interest in INVH LP and has the full, exclusive, and complete responsibility for and discretion over the day-to-day management and control of INVH LP.\n8\nOur principal executive offices are located at 5420 LBJ Freeway, Suite 600, Dallas, Texas 75240, and our telephone number is (972) 421-3600.\nOur Platform\nOur vertically integrated, scalable platform allows greater influence over the experience of our residents while enabling us to better control operating costs and continuously share best practices across functional areas of the business. Our differentiated platform is built upon: \n•\nResident-centric focus\n. Our high-touch business model enables us to continuously solicit and integrate resident feedback into our operations and tailor our approach to address their preferences, providing a superior living experience and fostering customer loyalty. We believe this, in turn, drives rent growth, occupancy, and low turnover rates and will enable us to develop significant brand equity in the longer term.\n•\nLocal presence and expertise\n. In-market managers oversee the operations of local leasing, property management, and maintenance teams, enabling us to provide outstanding resident service, leverage local expertise in managing rental, occupancy, and turnover rates, and improve cost and oversight of renovations and ongoing maintenance of our homes. As a result of our concentrated footprint within our core markets, our regional managers and in-market teams are able to realize local-operator advantages, while still benefiting from significant economies of scale.\n•\nScalable, centralized infrastructure\n. We support local market operations with national strategy, infrastructure, workflows enabled by technology, and standards to drive efficiency, consistency, and cost savings. We utilize our extensive scale and investments in technology to ensure the consistent quality of our resident experience and maximize cost efficiencies and purchasing power. On a national level we are also able to standardize resident leases, employ a consistent approach to resident screening and leasing operations, and utilize a tailored pricing tool that analyzes publicly available data to reflect local market conditions.\nOur approach to investment and asset management similarly combines local presence and expertise with national oversight. Our investment and asset management teams are primarily located in-market and apply their local market knowledge within the framework of a proprietary and consistent underwriting methodology, with support from national leadership focused on investment and asset management strategy based in our corporate headquarters. Through the integration of investment, property management, and asset management functions, our platform enables our teams to incorporate real-time information regarding leasing activity, property operations, maintenance, and capital spending into asset selection and asset management. We believe the advantages of our integrated acquisition platform and local market expertise drive the performance of our existing total portfolio of 85,138 owned homes as of December 31, 2024, as well as the portfolio of homes we jointly own with or manage on behalf of others. We similarly believe that employing experienced, in-house acquisitions teams at the local level gives us a competitive advantage in selectively acquiring homes that will maximize risk-adjusted total return.\nOur Business Activities\nSince our founding in 2012, we have built a proven, vertically integrated operating platform that allows us to effectively and efficiently acquire, renovate, lease, maintain, and manage both the homes we own as well as those we manage on behalf of others, including our joint venture partners and third parties. Our differentiated approach, which combines a resident-centric focus, local market presence and expertise, and national strategy, infrastructure, technology-enabled workflows, and standards, informs all areas of our operations. \nProperty Operations\nProperty operations encompasses the in-house local market management and execution of marketing, leasing, resident relations, and maintenance functions. We have developed and employ a highly scalable, vertically integrated, and resident-centric property management service platform, referred to as “ProCare.” All of our property management functions have been internally managed since our founding in 2012, and we have implemented an extensive property management infrastructure, including an online resident portal, smart home technology, a mobile app for residents to schedule and track maintenance requests, a technology suite to manage work orders and associate schedules, dedicated in-market associates, and local offices in each of our core markets. \n9\nWe have organized our property management associates and operating structure such that Vice Presidents of Operations in each of our core markets are responsible for the operations of local leasing, property management, and maintenance teams. We believe our operating model differentiates our approach to local market operations and enables us to provide superior, high-touch resident service, maximize the effectiveness of our in-market associates in managing rental, occupancy, and turnover rates and improve our cost management and oversight over both upfront renovations and ongoing maintenance.\nAll of our local market associates are supported by our centralized national infrastructure, which allows us to deploy best practices and standardized processes where appropriate. The combination of our local market presence and national infrastructure enables us to exercise greater control over our property management service platform, allowing us to enhance the experience of our residents, better manage operating costs, and share best practices across various functional areas of our business.\nMarketing and Leasing\nOur associates are responsible for establishing rental rates, marketing and leasing properties, and collecting and processing rent. We establish and manage rental rates based on a tailored pricing tool that analyzes publicly available data to reflect local market conditions, including a competitive analysis of market rents for institutional single-family rental properties, as well as the size, fit and finish, and location of the home, the number of applications received, and the number of days a home has been available on the market. We also consider a number of qualitative factors, such as neighborhood characteristics, community amenities, and proximity to employment centers, desirable schools, transportation corridors, and local services.\nWe typically begin pre-marketing properties 30 to 45 days in advance of their becoming vacant to maintain high occupancy rates and reduce vacancy losses. We advertise available properties through multiple channels, including our proprietary website, internet listing services (such as Zillow, Trulia, HotPads, and Realtor.com), Multiple Listing Service (“MLS”), yard signs, search engine marketing, digital media, and local brokers. We offer flexible showing options for convenience, including virtual tours and floor plans, self-showings that leverage smart home technology, and in-person showings. We own internal brokerages to serve the states in which we operate and utilize in-market leasing experience specialists to drive an end-to-end resident experience that achieves our occupancy, revenue, and retention goals while facilitating enjoyment of a worry-free leasing lifestyle.\nProspective residents may submit an application through our proprietary mobile app or on our website. To maintain brand consistency and better track compliance with leasing requirements, we utilize standardized online applications, national lease agreements, move-in and move-out documents, resident communications, and other ancillary documents. Multiple channels are utilized to communicate with prospective residents, including automated email and texts, associate correspondence, and the new addition of an AI leasing assistant. We evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of third-party resident screening providers that obtain appropriate identification, evaluate credit history and household income, review the applicant’s rental history, and complete a background check for criminal activity, each in accordance with applicable law. Although we require a minimum income to rent ratio, many additional factors are also considered during the resident evaluation process, including eviction history, criminal history, and rental and other payment history. \nOur disciplined investment strategy and local, in-market approach have given us scale and density of homes in desirable neighborhoods, enabling us to execute cost-effective advertising strategies targeting potential residents whose online behaviors indicate interest in these neighborhoods. We believe this approach increases our likelihood of capturing and retaining residents and enhances our opportunity to develop and market other programs and services.\nDigital Marketing Initiatives and Branding\nOur brand is differentiated through our commitment to providing high-quality living solutions and a professional property management team to support our residents, reflective of the needs of the rising generation of millennial renters. The ease of leasing through our technology, the Genuine Care from our teams, and our exceptional value-add services help our residents live the worry-free leasing lifestyle. We encourage meaningful community interaction across our digital platforms by continuously refreshing the content of our website, blog, and social media accounts with articles, home maintenance advice, giveaways, and incentives designed to enrich the lives of our residents and protect our homes. For example, we alert our residents to prepare for storms, encourage them to pay their rent online, offer “Lease Friendly” and “Make It Home” design tips and giveaways, and hold an annual Resident Appreciation Month. Our resident engagement and social following \n10\ncontinue to grow, owing partially to positive feedback from residents, who specifically mention our lifestyle and home maintenance content.\nResident Relations and Property Maintenance\nThe associates in each of our markets are responsible for property repairs and maintenance, as well as resident relations. In coordination with a third-party vendor, we offer a 24/7 emergency telephone line to handle after-hours maintenance issues on an expedited basis as needed, and our residents can also contact us through our mobile app, our online resident portal, our call centers, or our local property management offices. As part of our property management best practices, we seek to conduct routine repairs and maintenance in a timely manner, as appropriate, by appointment at the resident’s convenience. We seek to utilize quality materials to minimize the recurrence of maintenance requests and maximize long-term rental income and cash flows from our portfolio. \nWe typically utilize our in-house maintenance associates in each of our markets to provide ordinary course, “handyman” services, and outsource more complex or extensive repairs, such as roofing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) systems, plumbing, and electrical work to vetted, pre-approved third-party vendor partners. We strive to maximize the number of maintenance calls that are addressed by our in-house maintenance technicians. In cases where we outsource more complex or extensive repairs, our in-house maintenance associates provide oversight to ensure quality control and cost effectiveness. In addition, our in-house market-based associates conduct ProCare visits with residents at move-in, 45 days after move-in, and prior to move-out to help foster positive, long-term relationships with our residents, track and report maintenance needs effectively, and support compliance with lease terms, local laws, and HOA rules and regulations. \nProCare service, our proactive property management service platform, includes several touchpoints over the term of a resident’s lease designed to enhance their satisfaction with our service model, improve the efficiency of our service and our homes’ systems, and ensure that each resident is properly educated regarding the home and their responsibilities. When a new resident moves into one of our homes, our associates conduct a resident orientation during which we revisit the terms of the lease, outline what aspects of the home’s upkeep are the resident’s responsibility, walk through all of the home’s major systems in order to familiarize the resident with their safe and proper operation, and inform the resident that we will be conducting a post move-in maintenance visit. Following the move-in orientation, each resident is encouraged to keep a record of any non-emergency service items. We conduct a post move-in maintenance visit approximately 45 days after move-in, during which our in-house property maintenance associates will address any non-emergency service needs the resident has noted. We believe this process has a number of benefits. First, by conducting an in-person move-in orientation, we are able to ensure that residents understand their obligations under the terms of their lease, as well as how to safely and properly operate the home’s systems, reducing both the likelihood of misaligned expectations and unnecessary wear and tear on the property. Second, by scheduling a post move-in maintenance visit, we are able to address multiple service requests in a single visit, improving the resident experience by avoiding the inconvenience of multiple service appointments and improving the efficiency and productivity of our in-house property maintenance associates. Finally, the post move-in maintenance visit allows us to more quickly identify residents who may not be adhering to the terms of their lease or may be subjecting the home to undue wear and tear and/or damages as a result of their treatment of the property.\nWe also conduct pre-move-out consultations 15 to 30 days prior to scheduled resident move-outs and any additional pre-move-out consultations required by applicable law. These consultations allow us to notify residents of any repairs they may need to undertake prior to moving out of the property, such as removing scuff marks or landscaping maintenance. In addition, these visits allow our in-house property maintenance associates to begin preparing a scope of work and budget for the turnover work we undertake between residents to prepare our homes to be re-leased to a new resident. These visits also improve our ability to pre-market our homes.\nRegardless of the purpose or timing of the visit, our in-house property maintenance associates are required to conduct a general property condition assessment (“GPCA”) every time they visit one of our homes. The GPCA requires our in-house property maintenance associates to assess and document interior and exterior conditions and whether the resident is adhering to the terms of their lease, as well as any potential safety hazards or potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed. If a deficiency is identified by our in-house property maintenance associates we endeavor to take prompt action to correct it. \n11\nInvestment and Asset Management\nAcquisition Strategy\nWe have a disciplined acquisition platform that is capable of deploying capital from multiple capital sources, including our own balance sheet and joint ventures that we manage, across multiple acquisition channels and markets simultaneously. Our strategy targets both existing homes through portfolio acquisitions or via MLS and newly constructed homes via strategic relationships with homebuilders. Our markets were generally selected through a robust process utilizing an analysis of housing and rental market supply and demand fundamentals, macroeconomic and demographic trends, and risk-adjusted total return potential. Specifically, the process we use to select and, on an ongoing basis, evaluate our markets ranks these markets based on relative weightings of factors that include, but are not limited to, forecast population and employment growth, household formation, historical and forecast deliveries of new residential housing supply, size of the addressable market, volume of new and existing home sales, potential yields implied by the relationship between market rental rates and the price of single-family residential housing, forecast home price appreciation, and forecast rental rate growth. \nWe have amassed significant scale within our 16 core markets. In these markets, our acquisition strategy has been, and will continue to be, focused on buying, renovating, and operating high quality single-family homes for lease that we believe will appeal to and attract a high quality resident base, that will experience robust long-term demand, and that will benefit from capital appreciation. In evaluating acquisitions, we analyze numerous factors, including neighborhood desirability, proximity to employment centers, schools, and transportation corridors, community amenities, construction type, and required ongoing capital needs, among others.\nWe target submarkets and neighborhoods in undersupplied high-growth markets and leverage our in-house acquisition and operations teams’ local market expertise to acquire homes in desirable locations that we believe will experience above average rental rate growth and home price appreciation. Our in-house acquisition teams are comprised of dedicated professionals located in our markets and at our corporate headquarters who provide strategic direction and broad oversight. Our acquisition teams have significant local market experience and expertise in single-family investments and sales, which enables us to target specific submarkets, neighborhoods, individual streets, and homes that meet our selection and underwriting criteria. As part of our selective and disciplined investment approach, we have analyzed and considered a far greater number of potential acquisitions than the number of homes we have actually acquired or have agreed to purchase in the future from a homebuilder with whom we have a strategic relationship. We thus have a substantial proprietary database from which we can draw as we evaluate future acquisition opportunities in our markets. As a result of our large existing portfolio and volume of acquisitions to date, we believe we have a high degree of visibility into publicly available market data on rental rates and fixed and controllable operating expenses, which allows us to more accurately underwrite expected net yields of homes prior to acquisition. \nTo identify investment and acquisition opportunities, we engage with local market real estate brokers, homebuilders, and strategic third-party technology platforms. Within our markets, our approach allows us to screen broadly and rapidly to identify potential acquisitions in highly targeted submarkets at the neighborhood and street levels. Our in-house team of acquisition professionals coordinates with our in-house renovation, maintenance, and property management teams to ensure that feedback from historical acquisitions is shared across functions so that our ongoing investment activities are informed by, and benefit from, insight from prior experience.\nPartnerships with Homebuilders\nWe have increasingly leveraged strategic relationships with homebuilders to identify opportunities to purchase newly constructed homes. These partnerships allow us to meaningfully scale and expand our portfolio with single-family homes that are specifically designed to be leased by our target customer. We commission the construction of homes in high-demand areas that cater to the needs and preferences of our residents, contributing to the overall number of homes available in a supply-constrained environment. These contractual arrangements generally provide for periodic deposits from us to the homebuilders and scheduled delivery of homes over a specified period of time.\n12\nProperty Renovations\nWe have an in-house team of dedicated associates located in our markets who oversee the upfront property renovation process and the ongoing maintenance of our homes, with support from centralized construction experts and infrastructure, including technology-enabled workflows. This team works in collaboration with our in-house investment and property management teams to maximize the total return of our upfront investment and minimize ongoing maintenance costs. To this end, our professionals ensure the following are evaluated: the structural needs and major systems of a property (e.g., examining roofs, HVAC systems, and siding); other maintenance-reducing improvements and repairs (e.g., installing durable hard-surface flooring, removing carpet from high-traffic areas, and testing plumbing and pipes both in the home and out to the street); and the level of fit and finish required to maintain consistency with our brand standards and maximize rental demand (e.g., selecting cabinet and countertop finishes and appliances designed to improve resident demand). \nIn general, before a previously owned home is acquired or first becomes vacant after acquisition, our in-house teams begin the renovation process by preparing a detailed renovation budget and scope of work based on an assessment of each property’s major systems and structural features. These include HVAC, roofs, pools, and plumbing and electrical systems. In addition, we also evaluate other features of the home’s fit and finish, including appliances, landscaping, decks and/or patios, and fixtures. During our initial assessment, we also determine the potential for, and potential return on, any value-additive upgrades that may reduce future operating costs or enhance rental demand and, by extension, our ability to realize more attractive rental, occupancy, or turnover rates. \nWe are able to drive cost efficiencies through oversight by our local associates of the entire process of renovating our homes. Each property’s detailed budget and scope of work prepared by our in-house team of renovation professionals is reviewed and vetted by our operations teams, both locally and nationally, and in certain cases of work we contract directly, presented for bid to one or more of our pre-approved vendor partners in each of our markets. In the case of work for which we rely upon general contractors, we set prices based on the scope of work involved. By establishing and enforcing best practices and quality consistency, and through a constant process of evaluating and grading our vendor partners, we believe that we are able to reduce the costs of both materials and labor. For example, we have negotiated discounts and extended warranties for products that we regularly use during the renovation process, including appliances, HVAC systems and components, carpet and flooring, and paint, among others. We are also able to reduce general contractor fees by working directly with vendors. We believe this approach results in both a larger proportion of our upfront renovation expenditures going toward actual investment in our homes as well as lower overall expenditures than if we were to outsource all elements of vendor selection and oversight to third-party general contractors. \nPortfolio Optimization\nWe maintain a sophisticated process to identify and efficiently dispose of homes that no longer fit our investment objectives and recycle capital into homes that better fit our long-term investment objectives. We believe our approach helps streamline the disposition process and minimize costs. By leveraging multiple distribution channels — including bulk portfolio sales, our “Resident First Look” program (which facilitates home sales to our current residents), direct-to-market sales, and MLS — we can facilitate efficient and well-targeted transactions. We believe the significant local density of our portfolio, which averages approximately 5,000 homes in each of our core markets as of December 31, 2024, allows us to selectively sell properties without sacrificing the operating efficiency of our concentrated scale. \nSustainability and Corporate Responsibility\nAs one of the nation’s premier home leasing companies, we have an opportunity to make a profound impact through sustainability and corporate responsibility initiatives. We are committed to engaging with our communities to make meaningful and long-lasting impacts on those around us. We are dedicated to fostering a better way of living for our residents and empowering our associates to advance efforts that make our company more innovative and our processes more sustainable. We are committed to implementing programs that align with our values and reflect our dedication to providing a high-quality resident experience. We are equally dedicated to upholding the ethical standards and responsible business practices that are integral to our culture.\n13\nWe focus on ensuring that our residents live in high-quality homes and enjoy a worry-free leasing lifestyle, with access to professional services and Genuine Care. Our scale enables us to offer enhanced services and exclusive offers that further improve the leasing experience. We are equally committed to remaining true to the values, ethics, and responsible business practices that we embed in our culture.\nWe value being part of the communities where we do business, and we recognize that the vitality of our business is directly linked to the vitality of the communities in which we operate. We also believe our business has a positive economic impact on the communities in which we operate, through improved neighborhoods that benefit from our home renovations, the value of our local teams living in and contributing to the local economy, the payment of real estate taxes, and the purchase of local goods and services. \nWe are committed to incorporating sustainability and corporate responsibility considerations into our strategy, processes, and operations. Our board of directors maintains ultimate oversight of our sustainability strategy. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board monitors and oversees our sustainability efforts, initiatives, and policies. Our executive leadership takes a hands-on role in furthering strategy and in ensuring that we are accurately following and reporting on corporate responsibility activities and outcomes.\nFor information about our perspective on climate change see Part II. Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Climate Change.”\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 1,750 dedicated full-time associates, which we supplement with temporary and contract resources as needed. None of our associates are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Associates are the backbone of our company, and we understand that nothing is accomplished without the day-to-day dedication of our invaluable teams. Whether they are front-line market associates who represent us each and every day with our residents or centralized team members who support the front line and strive to ensure the quality and consistency of our work, our associates are our greatest asset. From our focus on associates’ well-being, health, and safety to our support of a supportive and collaborative culture, we act with honesty, integrity, and respect. \nOur efforts aim to foster a workplace culture that values respect, opportunity, and belonging. We support fair access to opportunities through our hiring practices and are committed to fair practices that ensure a level playing field for all associates. The investment in our people is directly linked to our strategic business initiatives and measured by those outcomes.\nWe value feedback from our associates, and we maintain a continuous listening associate survey tool, \nOur Family. Your Voice. \nWe continue to achieve high participation by our associates, with 82% of our associates sharing feedback at least once in 2024. \nThis tool pro\nvides managers with actionable feedback on several key engagement dimensions. We believe meaningful actions based on associate feedback provided by the surveys have resulted, and will continue to result, in ongoing high engagement with our associates as evidenced by our strong associate \nNet Promoter Score of 60 at the end of 2024, \ncompared to a benchmark of 33. In \n2024\n, we were recognized for our company culture through several external awards, including U.S. News Best Companies to Work for in Real Estate, and Best Companies to Work for in the South. \nWe recognize the value of providing regular development opportunities for our associates that improve their capability to succeed in their current roles and achieve career growth to meet their aspirations. \nGrowing People for Success \nis our fully integrated talent cycle that incorporates our performance and feedback process, career growth and development, and leadership behaviors model. We also conduct an annual mandatory compliance training campaign and offer a robust catalog of online learning and development videos designed to help associates build their skills. We were recognized by Comparably in 2024 for Best Company for Career Growth.\nWe are committed to accelerating the development of our leaders through various programs such as “Leadership Foundations,” “Leading through Change,” and our operations management training. These programs are designed to build capable and confident leaders that can lead and inspire in an ever-changing environment. In \n2024\n, we facilitated the third cohort of “Peak,” an immersive six-month leadership development program for 25 high potential leaders. We also launched “Spark,” the next level leadership program focused on emerging leaders. In addition, we offered customized talent management solutions, including Stand Out assessments, leadership assimilations, team building activities, and more. This commitment to leadership development resulted in Invitation Homes being recognized by Comparably in \n2024\n as having the Best Company for Leadership.\n14\nWe believe that competitive compensation and benefits are key drivers of associate attraction, retention, motivation, and engagement. Compensation is one component of our \nTotal Value\n offering for Invitation Homes associates, and we strive to compensate associates fairly and consistently based on market rates for their roles, experience, and how they perform. We monitor our pay equity practices on an ongoing basis and consider pay equity dynamics when promoting internally and hiring externally. Sustaining pay equity is a key focus for us now and in the future.\nAnother component of our \nTotal Value\n offering for associates is our holistic wellness program, which is designed to enhance mental, physical, and financial well-being. Health and safety programs and processes are also vitally important to the wellbeing of our associates, and we conduct monthly safety training for our maintenance associates and a regular driving safety training for our fleet drivers. We strive to drive continuous improvement in our health and safety performance by maintaining high standards for our health and safety compliance programs and reinforcing expectations with respect to safe behaviors and safety rules. We endeavor to ensure that our associates are well-informed about health and safety measures and are provided with the appropriate equipment and tools to protect themselves and those around them. We continually monitor the number of work-related injuries per 100 associates in a one-year period. New incidents are reported and evaluated for corrective action, and through continuous investment in health and safety, we strive to mitigate the risk of on-the-job injuries. Our \n2024\n incident rate was 3.39, compared to 3.39 in 2023 and 3.49 in 2022.\nGovernance and Ethical Business Practices\nWe strive every day to ensure that our actions result in value for the individuals and organizations that have chosen to invest in our company, and we take that responsibility very seriously. We believe that ethical business practices and good governance promote the long-term interests of our stockholders, strengthen the board of directors and management accountability, and improve our standing as a trusted member of the communities we serve. \nWe believe it is critically important to maintain a corporate culture that demands integrity and reflects our ethical values. We are committed to operating at the highest ethical level and serving as a responsible fiduciary for our stockholders. We are committed to exercising and maintaining strong corporate governance practices, while integrating corporate responsibility and sustainability considerations into our decision-making processes. We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”) that is applicable to all of our directors, officers, and associates. Our Code of Conduct drives our daily decisions, demonstrating our commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen and a good business partner, and our actions are guided by our company’s core values. The Code of Conduct articulates these tenets and sets forth our principles, expectations, and guidelines for appropriate business behavior.\nCode of Conduct \nOur Code of Conduct is supported by company wide policies and programs and reinforced through regular associate training. Honesty and integrity are essential in our daily interactions with residents, fellow associates, vendors, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Our Code of Conduct outlines these key principles, including policies on conflicts of interest, gifts and entertainment, fraud, sanctions, outside activities, political contributions, and bribery and corruption. Any associate who violates the requirements of the Code of Conduct, or any of our other policies, is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. \nReporting Violations and Whistleblower Protection \nOur confidential compliance hotline is critical to our ethics and compliance program. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is operated by a third-party compliance management provider, enabling automated and anonymous reporting. We have established a whistleblower policy, enabling associates to report concerns confidentially and anonymously. This policy includes comprehensive procedures for the receipt, retention, investigation, and treatment of reports. The reports are reviewed with our audit committee at meetings throughout the year. Our Code of Conduct provides that “neither our company, nor any director, officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of the company will, directly or indirectly, discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against any person who, in good faith, makes a report or assists in investigating a report.”\n15\nVendor Practices \nWe have adopted a Vendor Code of Conduct that extends our values to company vendors and highlights our commitment to ethical business practices, fair and safe labor conditions, the protection of human rights, sustainability, and regulatory compliance. This code defines the expectations we hold for our vendors to align with the standards we strive to uphold in every aspect of our operations.\nRisk and Insurance\nWe maintain property, casualty, flood, and corporate-level insurance coverage related to our business, including general liability, business auto, umbrella, commercial crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary liability, cyber liability, employment practices liability, and workers’ compensation insurance. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice. However, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage exclusions, and we are self-insured up to the amount of such deductibles and exclusions. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Operations — \nIncreasing property taxes, insurance costs, and HOA fees may negatively affect our financial results” \nand\n We may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance.\n” \nSystems and Technology\nEffective systems and technology are essential components of our business. To ensure scalability for continued growth of our portfolio of single-family homes for lease and our third-party management platform, we have made significant investments in various processes and systems including lease and property management, construction management, property and corporate accounting, asset management and data analysis. In addition to carefully monitoring our core platform, we consistently advance cloud-based digital technologies to benefit both our residents and our associates.\nWe offer choice and control to our prospective and existing residents by providing a mobile-responsive website, an iOS app, and an Android app to engage with us. Prospective residents can browse homes available for lease, take virtual tours, request additional information, and apply to lease a specific home. Our existing residents have the added convenience of requesting maintenance services, paying rent, and learning about value-add services – all from their digital platform of choice.\nOur associates are able to support and manage requests for critical functions such as leasing and maintenance through easy-to-use digital tools. Our system is designed to handle the core requirements of residential property accounting, including accounting for security deposits as well as payment of property-level expenses. The system also interfaces with our third-party resident screening vendors to expedite evaluations of prospective residents’ rental applications.\nThroughout our operations, we rely on technology systems that integrate with various third-party vendors and service providers. The failure of these systems or services to perform at subscribed levels could adversely impact our business. Taking a proactive approach and engaging with our third-party vendors about service delivery and implementing security risk management controls allow us to mitigate any potential negative impact on our business. For more information on the risks related to our use of technology and cybersecurity risk management, see Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data Protection — \nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer” \nand Part I. Item 1C.\n “\nCybersecurity\n.”\nCompetition\nWe face competition from different sources in each of our primary activities: acquiring and leasing our properties and providing property and asset management services for single-family homes. We believe our competitors in acquiring properties for investment purposes are larger investors, including private equity funds and other REITs, that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified, individual investors, and small private investment partnerships looking for one-off acquisitions of investment properties that can either be leased or restored and sold. Our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors, public and private REITs, and other sizable private institutional investors. These same competitors may also compete with us for residents and may provide \n16\nproperty and asset management services similar to those that we provide. Competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase, reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties, reduce the occupancy of our portfolio, and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns. However, we believe that our acquisition platform, our extensive in-market property operations infrastructure, and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages.\nInflation and Macroeconomic Conditions\nInflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of increased repair and maintenance and other costs and wage pressures. Inflation could also impact our cost of capital as a result of changing interest rates on variable rate debt that is not hedged or if our debt instruments are refinanced in a high-inflation environment. Our resident leases typically have a term of one to two years, which generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our homes to current market rates. Although an extreme or sustained escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this had a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAdditionally, increased interest rates, political dissension, and fluctuating global and United States economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, and other factors that are beyond our control could negatively affect our business and financial condition.\nMandated and proposed tariffs to be imposed by the United States on imports from certain countries and potential counter-tariffs in response could lead to increased costs and supply chain disruptions. If we are not able to navigate any such changes, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as on the price of our common stock.\nSeasonality\nOur business and related operating results have been, and we believe will continue to be, impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year. In particular, we have experienced higher levels of resident move-outs during the summer months, which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs. Further, our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as HVAC repairs and costs to re-resident during the summer season. \nRegulation\nGeneral\nOur business operations and properties are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and rules, as well as covenants, some of which may conflict with one another or have limited judicial or regulatory interpretations. We seek to comply in all material respects with such laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, and covenants, and we also require that our residents agree to do the same under their leases with us. \nIn light of the recent change in administration in the United States, there is considerable uncertainty and potential conflict regarding and among existing laws, judicial orders and bans, new presidential executive orders, regulatory frameworks, leadership changes, and enforcement priorities and strategies, further complicating compliance with such laws, orders and regulations.\nFair Housing Act\nThe Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) and its state law counterparts and the regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women, and people in the process of adopting a child or securing custody of children under the age of 18), disability or, in some states, financial capability and veteran status, among other protected classes. We train our associates on a regular basis regarding such laws and regulations and we believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the FHA and other such regulations. \n17\nMunicipal Regulations and Homeowners’ Associations\nOur properties are subject to various municipal regulations and orders, and county and city ordinances, including without limitation, use, operation and maintenance of our properties. Certain of our properties are subject to the rules of the various HOAs where such properties are located. HOA rules and regulations are commonly referred to as “covenants, conditions and restrictions,” or CC&Rs, and typically consist of various restrictions or guidelines regarding use and maintenance of the property, including, among others, landscaping standards, noise restrictions, or guidelines as to how many cars may be parked on the property. \nBroker Licensure\nWe own internal brokerages to serve the states in which we operate and utilize in-market leasing experience specialists to drive an end-to-end resident experience that achieves our occupancy, revenue, and retention goals while facilitating enjoyment of a worry-free leasing lifestyle. Our internal brokerages are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern the licensure of real estate agents and brokers and affiliate brokers and set forth standards for, and prohibitions on, the conduct of real estate brokers. Such standards and prohibitions include, among others, those relating to fiduciary and agency duties, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, and advertising and consumer disclosures, as well as compliance with federal, state, and local laws and programs for providing housing to low-income families. Under applicable state law, we generally have a duty to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of our internal brokerages. \nEnvironmental Matters\nAs a current or prior owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and ordinances, and we could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties, even if we no longer own such properties. We are not aware of any environmental matters that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory Related Risks — \nContingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.\n”\nResidential Housing Legislation and Regulations\nLegislative and regulatory efforts across the United States have increasingly focused on addressing the shortage of residential housing and the rising cost of living. In response, some states and local jurisdictions have introduced or enacted regulations that limit landlords’ ability to screen applicants, raise rents, process evictions, or terminate leases. \nWe are closely monitoring developments related to such regulations. However, the timing and outcome of specific proposals or policies remain uncertain, as do their potential impacts on our operations.\nLaws and Regulations Regarding Privacy and Data Protection\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve matters such as privacy, data protection, content, consumer protection, and other matters. These regulations include laws requiring holders of personal data to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach. Data privacy and security at the state level remains an evolving landscape. We endeavor to comply with privacy laws and regulations applicable to us. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which came into effect on January 1, 2020, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective on January 1, 2023, governs the collection, use, disclosure, and security of information about California residents. It also requires us to, among other things, provide certain disclosures to California residents, promptly respond to certain consumer requests related to their data, and contractually impose certain obligations on vendors. Other states in the United States have either passed, proposed, or are considering similar laws and regulations to the CCPA and CPRA (such as the Nevada Privacy of Information Collected on the Internet from Consumers Act, which became effective on October 1, 2021, the Colorado Privacy Act and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, which both became effective in 2023, and the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, which became effective on July 1, 2024) which could impose similarly significant operational and legal obligations, potential liabilities and costs. Such laws and regulations are expected to vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, thus further increasing costs, operational and legal burdens, and the potential for liability on regulated entities. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data \n18\nProtection — \nOur business is subject to laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, or otherwise harm our business.\n”\nREIT Qualification\nWe have elected to qualify as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax on net taxable income that we distribute annually to our stockholders. To qualify as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders, and the diversity of ownership of our stock. To comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations.\nWebsite and Availability of SEC filings\nWe file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available to the public over the Internet at the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov. \nWe maintain an internet site at INVH.com, where we make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website and the information contained on or through that site are not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use our website INVH.com as a channel of distribution of material company information. For example, financial and other material information regarding our company is routinely posted on and accessible at INVH.com. Accordingly, investors should monitor the website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, and public conference calls and webcasts.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Part I. Item 1. “Business” and the consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements,” or in other parts of this report.\nFor similar operating and financial data and discussion of our results for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Part II. Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024 (the “2023 10-K”). The sections entitled “Result of Operations — Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022” and “Cash Flows — Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022” in Part II. Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations” of our \n2023 10-K\n are incorporated herein by reference.\nCapitalized terms used without definition have the meaning provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nInvitation Homes is a leading owner and operator of single-family homes for lease, offering residents high-quality homes in sought-after neighborhoods across the United States. As of December 31, 2024, we wholly own 85,138 homes for lease, jointly own 7,622 homes for lease, and provide professional third-party property and asset management services for an additional 17,678 homes, all of which are primarily located in 16 core markets across the country. These homes help meet the needs of a growing share of Americans who prefer the ease of a leasing lifestyle over the burden of owning a home. We provide our residents access to updated homes with features they value, as well as close proximity to jobs and access to good schools. The continued demand for our product proves that the choice and flexibility we offer are attractive to many people.\nWe operate in markets with strong demand drivers, high barriers to entry, and high rent growth potential, primarily in the Western United States, Florida, and the Southeast United States. Through disciplined market and asset selection, as well as through strategic mergers and acquisitions, we designed our wholly and jointly owned portfolios to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated. Since our founding in 2012, we have built a proven, vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire, renovate, lease, maintain, and manage both the homes we own and those we manage on behalf of others. \nThe portfolio of homes we own average approximately 1,880 square feet with three to four bedrooms and two bathrooms, appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than a typical multifamily resident. We invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs, reduce ongoing maintenance costs, and drive resident demand. \nAt Invitation Homes, we are committed to creating a better way to live and to being a force for positive change, while at the same time advancing efforts that make our company more innovative and our processes more sustainable. Sustainability is an important part of our strategic business objectives and is critical to our long-term success.\nOur commitment to high-touch customer service continuously enhances residents’ living experiences and provides homes where individuals and families can thrive. Each aspect of our operations — whether in our corporate headquarters or field offices located in our 16 core markets — is driven by a resident-centric model. Our associates take our values seriously and work hard every day to honor the trust our residents have placed in us to provide clean, safe, and functional homes for them and their loved ones. In turn, we focus on ensuring that our associates are fairly compensated and that we provide a culture that values respect, opportunity, and belonging. We also place a strong emphasis on the impact we have in our communities and to the environment in general, and we continue to develop programs that demonstrate those commitments. In addition, we ensure that we operate under strong, well-defined governance practices and adhere to the highest ethical standards at all times.  \n56\nImpact of Macroeconomic Trends\nGeneral economic conditions in the United States have fluctuated in recent quarters, and concerns persist regarding adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, elevated interest rates, political dissension, and labor shortfalls. Such macroeconomic factors coupled with uncertainty in financial markets, and a general decline in business activity and/or consumer confidence could adversely affect (i) our occupancy levels, our rental rates, and collections, (ii) our ability to acquire or dispose of properties on economically favorable terms, (iii) our access to financial markets on attractive terms, or at all, and (iv)\n \nthe value of our homes and our business that could cause us to recognize impairments in value of our tangible assets or goodwill. Inflationary pressures, bank failures, and other unfavorable global and regional economic conditions, as well as geopolitical events, may also negatively impact consumer income, credit availability, interest rates, and spending, among other factors, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, including the ability of our residents to pay rent. These factors, which include labor shortages and inflationary increases in labor and material costs, have impacted and may continue to impact certain aspects of our business. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, declines in income or asset values, and other macroeconomic factors.\nMandated and proposed tariffs to be imposed by the United States on imports from certain countries and potential counter-tariffs in response could lead to increased costs and supply chain disruptions. If we are not able to navigate any such changes, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as on the price of our common stock.\nWhile the degree to which we may continue to be affected by these macroeconomic challenges largely depends on the nature and duration of uncertain and unpredictable events, we believe that we are well suited to endure a shifting macroeconomic environment due to our diversification and resiliency. For further discussion of risks related to general economic conditions, see Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business Environment and Industry — \nOur operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets.\n”\nClimate Change\nPotential consequences of global climate change may range from more frequent extreme weather events to governmental policy developments and shifts in consumer preferences, which have the potential individually or collectively to disrupt our business as well as negatively affect our suppliers, contractors, and residents. Experiencing or addressing the various physical, regulatory, and transition risks from climate change may significantly reduce our revenues and profitability or cause us to generate losses. We are subject to evolving laws and regulations relating to climate change, promulgated by governmental and regulatory organizations, including regulations aimed at drastically increasing reporting and governance related to climate change as well as focused on limiting GHG emissions and the implementation of “green” building codes. \nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275, \nThe Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors\n. \nThis rule will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. In April\n \n2024, the SEC issued an order voluntarily staying the effectiveness of the new rules pending the completion of judicial review of certain legal challenges to their validity. On February 11, 2025, SEC Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda released a public statement and notified the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (where the challenges are consolidated) to hold off scheduling the case for argument to provide time for the SEC to further deliberate and determine next steps. Therefore, the timing of the effectiveness of these disclosure requirements is uncertain. We are currently assessing the effect of new rules on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n Additionally, t\nhe State of California recently passed the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that will impose broad climate-related disclosure obligations on certain companies doing business in California, including us, starting in 2026, though the Governor of California has directed further consideration of the implementation deadlines for each of the laws. Both laws have been challenged in federal court. Unless legal challenges to the foregoing new rules prevail or they are otherwise modified prior to effective dates or the effective dates are delayed, we will become subject to the rules as adopted, and they could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity. Disclosure obligations relating to sustainability matters are complex and not always consistent, making compliance difficult and uncertain.\nEvolving laws and regulations or any changed interpretation of such laws and regulations may require us to make costly improvements to our existing properties beyond our current plans to decrease the impact of our homes on the environment, resulting in increased operating costs. Incorporating greater resource efficiency into our homes, whether to comply with upgraded building codes or recommended practices given a region’s particular exposure to climate conditions or undertaken \n57\nto satisfy demand from increasingly environmentally conscious residents or to meet our own sustainability goals, could raise our costs to maintain our homes. In evaluating whether to implement voluntary improvements, we also consider that choosing not to enhance our homes’ resource efficiency can make them less attractive to municipalities and increase the vulnerability of residents in our communities to rising energy and water expenses and use restrictions. Additionally, choosing not to enhance our homes’ resource efficiency could make our portfolio less attractive to residents and investors. If we fail to manage transition risks effectively, our profitability and cash flow could suffer.\nWe intend to continue to research, evaluate, and utilize new or improved products and business practices consistent with our sustainability commitment. We believe our initiatives in this area can help put us in a better position to comply with evolving regulations directed at addressing climate change and similar environmental concerns and to meet growing resident demand for resource-efficient homes, as further discussed in Part I. Item 1. “Business — Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility.” \nWe recognize that climate change could have a significant impact on our portfolio of homes located in a variety of markets across the United States and that an increase in the number of acute weather events, natural disasters, and other climate-related events could significantly impact our business, operations, and homes. We actively consider physical risks such as the potential for natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires when assessing our portfolio of homes and our business processes. Such extreme climate related events are driving changes in market dynamics and stakeholder expectations and could result in disruptions to us, our suppliers, vendors, and residents. We recognize that we must continue to adapt our policies, objectives, and processes to prepare for such events and improve the resiliency of our physical properties and our business.\nOur management and the board of directors are focused on managing our business risks, including climate change-related risks. The process to identify, manage, and integrate climate-change risk is part of our comprehensive enterprise risk management program. Our board of directors, through its Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, is responsible for oversight of our management of risks related to environmental issues, climate related risks, and social issues. Our executive leadership regularly reports to the board of directors and the relevant committees on these risk areas and our initiatives for managing and mitigating these risks. By taking a proactive approach to climate-related risk, we aim to remain well-prepared for various climate scenarios, supporting our commitment to transparency and effective risk management. For more information on risks related to climate change, see Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Sustainability, Corporate Responsibility, and Governance — \nClimate change and related environmental issues, related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, and the transition to a lower-carbon economy may adversely affect our business\n, — \nWe are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, and severe weather, \nand — \nWe are subject to increasing scrutiny from investors and others regarding our sustainability responsibilities, which could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation, associate attraction and retention, and ability to raise capital.\n”\nOther Matters\nIn January\n \n2023, we received an inquiry from the staff of the SEC requesting information relating to our compliance with building codes and permitting requirements, related policies and procedures, and other matters. We are in the process of responding to, and cooperating with, this request. We cannot currently predict the timing, outcome, or scope of this inquiry.\n58\nOur Portfolio \nThe following table provides summary information regarding our total and Same Store portfolios as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 as noted below: \nMarket\nNumber of Homes\n(1)\nAverage Occupancy\n(2)\nAverage Monthly\nRent\n(3)\nAverage Monthly\nRent PSF\n(3)\n% of\nRevenue\n(4)\nWestern United States:\nSouthern California\n7,326\n96.5%\n$3,085\n$1.81\n11.1 \n%\nNorthern California\n4,127\n97.5%\n2,720\n1.72\n5.8 \n%\nSeattle\n3,957\n97.3%\n2,863\n1.49\n5.8 \n%\nPhoenix\n9,246\n97.0%\n2,049\n1.21\n9.7 \n%\nLas Vegas\n3,405\n96.7%\n2,192\n1.12\n3.8 \n%\nDenver\n2,728\n96.8%\n2,547\n1.39\n3.4 \n%\nWestern United States Subtotal\n30,789\n96.9%\n2,553\n1.46\n39.6 \n%\nFlorida:\nSouth Florida\n8,180\n96.4%\n3,015\n1.61\n12.1 \n%\nTampa\n9,543\n94.0%\n2,286\n1.21\n10.6 \n%\nOrlando\n6,794\n96.2%\n2,232\n1.19\n7.6 \n%\nJacksonville\n2,005\n96.8%\n2,171\n1.09\n2.2 \n%\nFlorida Subtotal\n26,522\n95.4%\n2,494\n1.32\n32.5 \n%\nSoutheast United States:\nAtlanta\n12,623\n95.3%\n2,030\n0.98\n12.6 \n%\nCarolinas\n6,005\n94.6%\n2,047\n0.96\n5.5 \n%\nSoutheast United States Subtotal\n18,628\n95.1%\n2,036\n0.98\n18.1 \n%\nTexas:\nHouston\n2,347\n95.0%\n1,915\n0.96\n2.2 \n%\nDallas\n3,158\n93.6%\n2,248\n1.09\n3.4 \n%\nTexas Subtotal\n5,505\n94.0%\n2,103\n1.04\n5.6 \n%\nMidwest United States:\nChicago\n2,468\n96.9%\n2,381\n1.48\n2.8 \n%\nMinneapolis\n1,061\n95.9%\n2,308\n1.18\n1.2 \n%\nMidwest United States Subtotal\n3,529\n96.6%\n2,359\n1.38\n4.0 \n%\nOther\n(5)\n:\n165\n46.9%\n2,068\n1.04\n0.2 \n%\nTotal / Average\n85,138\n95.8%\n$2,387\n$1.27\n100.0 \n%\nSame Store Total / Average\n76,601\n97.3%\n$2,392\n$1.28\n92.0 \n%\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024.\n(2)\nRepresents average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n(3)\nRepresents average monthly rent for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n(4)\nRepresents the percentage of rental revenues and other property income generated in each market for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n(5)\nRepresents homes located outside of our 16 core markets as of December 31, 2024, including 161 homes located in Nashville and 4 homes located in other markets that are generally being held for sale.\n59\nFactors That Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding factors that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals, rental rates and occupancy levels, collection rates, turnover rates and days to re-resident homes, property improvements and maintenance, property acquisitions and renovations, and financing arrangements. Sensitivity to many of these factors has been heightened as a result of current macroeconomic conditions, including elevated interest rates, political dissension, and labor shortfalls. Additionally, each of these factors may also impact the results of operations and financial condition of our joint venture investments and those of third parties for whom we perform property and asset management services, which would impact the amount of management fee revenues and income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that we earn.\nMarket Fundamentals:\n \nOur results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets, particularly in the Western United States and Florida, which represented 72.1% of our rental revenues and other property income during the year ended December 31, 2024. We actively monitor the impact of macroeconomic conditions on market fundamentals and quickly implement changes in pricing as market fundamentals shift.\nRental Rates and Occupancy Levels:\n Rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income. Our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and property-level factors, including market conditions, seasonality, resident defaults, and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and re-lease homes when residents vacate. An important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases, which typically have a term of one to two years.\nCollection Rates: \nOur rental revenues and other property income are impacted by the rate at which we collect such revenues from our residents. Despite our efforts to assist residents facing financial hardships who need flexibility to fulfill their lease obligations, a portion of amounts receivable may not ultimately be collected. We may also be constrained in our ability to collect resident receivables due to local ordinances restricting residential lease compliance options. Any amounts billed to residents that have been deemed uncollectible along with our estimate of amounts that may ultimately be uncollectible decrease our rental revenues and other property income.\nTurnover Rates and Days to Re-Resident:\n Other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include the length of stay of our residents, resident turnover rates, and the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents. Our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property, which is a component of the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents. The period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand, our marketing techniques, the size of our available inventory, the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks and/or source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business, and both current economic conditions and future economic outlook, including the impact of elevated interest rates, political dissension, and labor shortfalls which could adversely affect demand for our properties.\nProperty Improvements and Maintenance:\n Property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures, property operating and maintenance expense, and rental revenues. We actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures. As a result of recent inflationary trends, we have experienced, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs for certain materials and services necessary to improve and maintain our homes. We continue to actively manage the impact of inflation on these costs, and we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices compared to other purchasers due to our size and scale both nationally and locally.\nProperty Acquisitions and Renovations:\n Future growth in rental revenues and other property income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes, our pace of property acquisitions, and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home. Our ability to identify and acquire single-family homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations, the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels, and competition for our target assets. All of these factors may be negatively impacted by current inflationary trends and elevated interest rates, potentially reducing the number of homes we acquire.\nThe acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price, including payments for acquisition fees, property inspections, closing costs, title insurance, transfer taxes, recording fees, broker commissions, property taxes, and HOA fees (when applicable). Additionally, we incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental. The \n60\nscope of renovation work varies, but may include paint, flooring, carpeting, cabinetry, appliances, plumbing hardware, roof replacement, HVAC replacement, and other items required to prepare the home for rental. The time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance. The time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons, including the property’s acquisition channel, the condition of the property, whether the property was vacant when acquired, and whether there are any state or local restrictions on our ability to complete renovations as an essential business function. Additionally, the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks and/or source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business have increased the time required to renovate our homes. As a result of recent inflationary trends, we have experienced, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs for certain materials and services necessary to renovate our homes. We continue to actively manage the impact of inflation on the cost of renovations, and we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices compared to other purchasers due to our size and scale both nationally and locally.\nFinancing Arrangements:\n Financing arrangements directly impact our interest expense, our various debt instruments, and our ability to acquire and renovate homes. We have historically utilized indebtedness to fund the acquisition and renovation of new homes. Our current financing arrangements contain financial covenants and other terms and conditions, including variable interest rates in some cases, that are impacted by market conditions. Current macroeconomic conditions may continue to negatively affect volatility, availability of funds, and transaction costs (including interest rates) within financial markets. These factors may also negatively affect our ability to access financial markets as well as our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Part II. Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for further discussion regarding interest rate risk. Our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts, interest rates, financial covenants, and durations.\nMacroeconomics Conditions:\n Inflation, elevated interest rates, political dissension, and adverse global economic conditions could negatively affect our business and financial condition. Mandated and proposed tariffs to be imposed by the United States on imports from certain countries and potential counter-tariffs in response could lead to increased costs and supply chain disruptions. If we are not able to navigate any such changes, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as on the price of our common stock.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nThe following is a description of the components of our revenues and expenses.\nRevenues\nRental Revenues and Other Property Income\nRental revenues, net of any concessions and bad debt (including write-offs, credit reserves, and uncollectible amounts), consist of rents collected under lease agreements related to our single-family homes for lease. We enter into leases directly with our residents, and the leases typically have a term of one to two years.\nOther property income is comprised of: (i) resident reimbursements for utilities, HOA fines, and other charge-backs; (ii) rent and non-refundable deposits associated with pets; (iii) revenues from value-add services such as smart homes, internet and media packages, home liability insurance, and HVAC replacement filters; and (iv) various other fees, including late fees and lease termination fees, among others.\nManagement Fee Revenues\nManagement fee revenues consist of fees from property and asset management services provided to portfolio owners of single-family homes for lease, including investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nExpenses\nProperty Operating and Maintenance \nOnce a property is available for its initial lease, which we refer to as “rent-ready,” we incur ongoing property-related expenses, which consist primarily of property taxes, insurance, HOA fees (when applicable), market-level personnel expenses, utility expenses, repairs and maintenance, and property administration. Prior to a property being “rent-ready,” certain of these expenses are capitalized as building and improvements. Once a property is “rent-ready,” expenditures for \n61\nordinary repairs and maintenance thereafter are expensed as incurred, and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home.\nProperty Management Expense\nProperty management expense represents personnel and other costs associated with the oversight and management of our portfolio of homes, including those for which we provide property and asset management services on behalf of others through our internal property manager.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense represents personnel costs, professional fees, and other costs associated with our day-to-day activities. General and administrative expense may also include expenses that are of a non-recurring nature, such as severance.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nWe issue share-based awards to align the interests of our associates with those of our investors, and all share-based compensation expense is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as components of general and administrative expense and property management expense.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest payable on our debt instruments, payments and receipts related to our interest rate swap agreements, amortization of discounts and deferred financing costs, unrealized gains (losses) on non-designated hedging instruments, and non-cash interest expense related to our interest rate swap agreements.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe recognize depreciation and amortization expense associated with our homes and other capital expenditures over the expected useful lives of the assets.\nCasualty Losses, Impairment, and Other\nCasualty losses, impairment, and other represents provisions for impairment when the carrying amount of our single-family residential properties is not recoverable and casualty (gains) losses, net of any insurance recoveries.\nGains (Losses) on Investments in Equity and Other Securities, net\nGains (losses) on investments in equity and other securities, net includes unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark to market adjustments and realized gains and losses recognized upon the sale or settlement of certain investments in equity securities and warrants.\nOther, net\nOther, net includes settlement and other costs related to certain litigation and regulatory matters, interest income, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. \nGain on Sale of Property, net of tax\nGain on sale of property, net of tax consists of net gains and losses resulting from sales of our homes.\nIncome (Losses) from Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nIncome (losses) from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our share of net earnings and losses from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.\n62\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Years\nEnded December 31,\n($ in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\nRevenues:\nRental revenues and other property income\n$\n2,548,964 \n$\n2,418,631 \n$\n130,333 \n5.4 \n%\nManagement fee revenues\n69,978 \n13,647 \n56,331 \n412.8 \n%\nTotal revenues\n2,618,942 \n2,432,278 \n186,664 \n7.7 \n%\nExpenses:\nProperty operating and maintenance\n935,273 \n880,335 \n54,938 \n6.2 \n%\nProperty management expense\n137,490 \n95,809 \n41,681 \n43.5 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n90,612 \n82,344 \n8,268 \n10.0 \n%\nInterest expense\n366,070 \n333,457 \n32,613 \n9.8 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n714,326 \n674,287 \n40,039 \n5.9 \n%\nCasualty losses, impairment, and other\n82,925 \n8,596 \n74,329 \n864.7 \n%\nTotal expenses\n2,326,696 \n2,074,828 \n251,868 \n12.1 \n%\nGains on investments in equity and other securities, net\n1,046 \n350 \n696 \n198.9 \n%\nOther, net\n(54,032)\n(2,435)\n(51,597)\nN/M\nGain on sale of property, net of tax\n244,550 \n183,540 \n61,010 \n33.2 \n%\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n(28,445)\n(17,877)\n(10,568)\n(59.1)\n%\nNet income\n$\n455,365 \n$\n521,028 \n$\n(65,663)\n(12.6)\n%\nPortfolio Information\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we owned 85,138 and 84,567 single-family rental homes, respectively, in our total portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we acquired 2,072 and 2,877 homes, respectively, and sold 1,501 and 1,423 homes, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we owned an average of 84,718 and 83,722 single-family rental homes, respectively.\nWe believe presenting information about the portion of our total portfolio that has been fully operational for the entirety of both a given reporting period and its prior year comparison period provides investors with meaningful information about the performance of our comparable homes across periods and about trends in our organic business. To do so, we provide information regarding the performance of our Same Store portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our Same Store portfolio consisted of 76,601 single-family rental homes.\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, total revenues were $2,618.9 million and $2,432.3 million, respectively. Set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total revenues.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, total portfolio rental revenues and other property income totaled $2,549.0 million and $2,418.6 million, respectively, an increase of 5.4%, driven by an increase in average monthly rent per occupied home and a 996 home increase between periods in the average number of homes owned, partially offset by a 80 bps reduction in average occupancy.\nAverage occupancy for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 for the total portfolio was 95.8% and 96.6%, respectively. Average monthly rent per occupied home for the total portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2,387 and $2,303, respectively, a 3.6% increase. For our Same Store portfolio, average occupancy was 97.3% and 97.4% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and average monthly rent per occupied home for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2,392 and $2,303, respectively, a 3.9% increase.\n63\nThe annual turnover rate for the Same Store portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 22.6% and 24.3%, respectively. For the Same Store portfolio, a home remained unoccupied on average for 40 and 38 days between residents for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTo monitor prospective changes in average monthly rent per occupied home, we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home, in each case, net of any amortized non-service concessions, to calculate net effective rental rate growth. Leases are either renewal leases, where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term, or new leases, where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home.\nRenewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 4.9% and 6.9% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 1.0% and 4.0% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For our Same Store portfolio, renewal lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 4.9% and 6.9% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and new lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 1.0% and 4.0% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther property income for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to enhanced value-add revenue programs and increased utility billbacks as new leases are entered into, among other things.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, management fee revenues totaled $70.0 million and $13.6 million, respectively. The increase is due to an increase in the number of homes for which we provide property and asset management services. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we provided property and asset management services for 25,300 and 3,848 homes, respectively, of which 7,622 and 3,848 homes, respectively, were owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nExpenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, total expenses were $2,326.7 million and $2,074.8 million, respectively. Set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, property operating and maintenance expense\n \nincreased\n to $935.3 million from $880.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to a 996 home \nincrease between periods in the average number of homes owned, increases in property taxes, utilities, and property maintenance, resulted in the overall 6.2% net increase in property operating and maintenance expense.\nProperty management expense and general and administrative expense increased\n to \n$228.1 million\n from \n$178.2 million\n for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs related to expansion of our property and asset management platform, including costs incurred to manage \n25,300 and 3,848 homes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nInterest expense increased to $366.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $333.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe increase in interest expense was primarily due to an \n11 bps increase in our weighted average interest rate and an approximate $500.0 million increase in the average debt balance outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased\n to $714.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $674.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to a \n$529.6 million year over year\n increase in building and improvements related to an\n increase of 571 homes in the number of homes owned as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n.\nCasualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were $82.9 million and $8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, casualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were comprised of net casualty losses of $82.4 million, \nincluding the recognition of \n$55.1 million\n for estimated losses and damages related to \nHurricanes Milton, Beryl, Debby, and Helene\n, net of estimated insurance proceeds, \nadditional storm activity unrelated to hurricanes during the year, and impairment losses of $0.5 million on our single-family residential properties. During the year ended December 31, 2023, impairment and other expenses were comprised of $8.2 million of net casualty losses and $0.4 million of impairment losses on our single-family residential properties.\n64\nGains (Losses) on Investments in Equity and Other Securities, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, $1.0 million of gains on investments in equity and other securities, net was comprised of a \n$1.6 million net realized gain from exercised warrants, partially offset by \n$0.6 million of net unrealized losses recognized since December 31, 2023 on investments held as of December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, $0.4 million gains on investments in equity and other securities, net was comprised of net unrealized gains recognized on investments held as of December 31, 2023.\nOther, net\nOther, net increased to $54.0 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $2.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, \nprimarily due to settlement and other costs incurred in connection with the resolution of an inquiry from the FTC and the legal dispute entitled \nCity of San Diego et al v. Invitation Homes, Inc.\nGain on Sale of Property, net of tax\nGain on sale of property, net of tax was $244.6 million and $183.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. An increase of 78 sold homes and an increase in the net proceeds per home sold for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2024 were the drivers of the increase.\nLosses from Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOur share of equity in earnings and/or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures was a net loss of $28.4 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in loss is primarily driven by a $8.1 million increase in our share of interest expense and a $2.9 million increase in our share of depreciation expense between the respective periods. These changes are a result of the formation of and commencement of operations in new joint ventures, cumulative capital expenditures, and an increase in the number of homes within our joint venture investments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $174.5 million and $700.6 million, respectively, a 75.1% \ndecrease\n primarily due to a $325.7 million net decrease in outstanding indebtedness between periods and $54.2 million of costs to acquire new financing.\nNew Credit Facility\nOn September 9, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides $3,500.0 million of borrowing capacity and consists of a $1,750.0 million revolving facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and a $1,750.0 million term loan facility (the “2024 Term Loan Facility”), both of which mature on September 9, 2028, with two six month extension options available. The Credit Facility replaced a credit facility that consisted of a $1,000.0 million revolving credit facility (the “2020 Revolving Facility”) and a $2,500.0 million term loan facility (the “2020 Term Loan Facility,” and together with the 2020 Revolving Facility, the “2020 Credit Facility”). Proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan Facility, a $750.0 million borrowing on the Revolving Facility on the date of effectiveness of the Credit Facility, and excess cash on hand were used to fully repay the 2020 Term Loan Facility and to pay costs associated with the transaction. For both the Revolving Facility and the 2024 Term Loan Facility, spreads at closing, based on our total leverage ratio, were 5 bps lower than the spreads most recently in effect for the 2020 Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $1,180.0 million of our Revolving Facility is undrawn, and there are no restrictions on our ability to draw funds thereunder provided we remain in compliance with all covenants. We have no debt reaching final maturity until June 2027.\nPublic Offering\nOn September 26, 2024, in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.88% Senior Notes which mature on February 1, 2035 (the “2035 Unsecured Notes”).\n65\nMortgage Loan Repayment\nIn November 2024, we used unrestricted cash from the 2035 Unsecured Notes and cash on hand to make a voluntary prepayment of the then-outstanding balance of IH 2018-4, which resulted in a release of the loan’s collateral.\nInterest Rate Swap Transactions\nIn September 2024, we amended certain interest rate swap agreements and entered into $1,400.0 million of new interest rate swap agreements which became active on December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our active swaps have a weighted average strike rate of 2.93%. We also have one forward starting swap which will become active July 9, 2025 and has a strike rate of 2.99%.\nInvestment in Joint Venture and New Property and Asset Management Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2024, we provided property and asset management services for 25,300 homes, of which 7,622 homes were owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. \nIn November 2024, we entered into a new joint venture agreement pursuant to which we committed to make a $50.0 million investment to form a joint venture that will acquire newly-constructed homes and communities in high-growth markets.\nOn April 29, 2024, we entered into a new joint venture agreement pursuant to which we \nmade an initial \n$37.5 million investment, representing a 7.2% ownership interest, in a portfolio of approximately 3,700 single-family residential properties. During the third quarter of 2024, we also began providing property and asset management services to those homes and approximately 700 additional homes owned by our joint venture partners.\nIn March 2024, we entered into a third-party agreement to provide property and asset management services to a portfolio of approximately 3,000 single-family homes for lease. Our direct management responsibilities for these homes commenced on May 15, 2024.\nOther\nOur ability to access capital as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of general economic conditions, including inflation and interest rates, as detailed in Part I.

Item 15. “Financial Statements — Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” For information about our derivative instruments that hedge floating rate debt, see Part IV. Item 15. “Financial Statements — Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”\n(2)\nVariable interest rate loans are indexed to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) index rate determined by reference to a published forward-looking SOFR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing (“Term SOFR”), including any credit spread adjustments provided for in the terms of the underlying agreement (“Adjusted SOFR”), reflected as “S” in the table above.\n(3)\nWeighted average years to maturity assumes all extension options are exercised, which are subject to certain conditions being met.\n(4)\nIH 2017-1 bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.23% per annum, equal to the market determined pass-through rate payable on the certificates including applicable servicing fees.\n67\n(5)\nThe Secured Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.59% per annum including applicable servicing fees for the first 11 years and for the twelfth year bears interest at a floating rate based on a spread of 147 bps over a comparable or successor rate to one month LIBOR as provided for in our loan agreement, including applicable servicing fees, subject to certain adjustments as outlined in the loan agreement.\n(6)\nAs of December 31, 2024, interest rate is based on Term SOFR of 4.33% plus the applicable margin and a 0.10% credit spread adjustment.\n(7)\nFor unsecured debt and total debt, the weighted average interest rate is calculated based on December 31, 2024, Term SOFR of 4.33% adjusted for a 0.10% credit spread adjustment (Adjusted SOFR), as appropriate, and includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements effective as of that date.\nAs part of our long-term debt strategy, our goal is to maintain or improve our credit ratings, and, over time, we generally intend to be a predominantly unsecured borrower with a target net debt of approximately 5.5 to 6.0 times trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n (see “— Non-GAAP Measures — EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n”). To facilitate our long-term debt strategy we expect to seek to, among other things, (a) refinance a significant portion of our secured debt maturing in 2027 with unsecured debt, including potential unsecured bond issuances and/or (b) repay a portion of such debt. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our long-term debt strategy, improving our credit ratings, or adhering to our targets in the short or medium term or at all, or that we will not change our strategy or targets in the future. We may from time to time fall outside of our target ranges. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional unsecured debt financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. For further discussion of risks related to our indebtedness, see Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Indebtedness,” including “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Indebtedness — \nWe may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations.\n”\nShort-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Needs\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations, make dividend payments to our stockholders, and meet other general requirements of our business. Our liquidity, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our near-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of:\n•\nacquisition of homes currently under contract, including commitments to homebuilders;\n•\nrenovation of newly-acquired homes;\n•\nHOA fees (as applicable), property taxes, insurance premiums, and the ongoing maintenance of our homes;\n•\nproperty management, general and administrative, and other entity-level commitments and expenses;\n•\ninterest expense;\n•\ndividend payments to our stockholders; and\n•\nrequired contributions to our joint ventures.\nWe believe our rental income, net of total expenses, will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund operations and dividend payments on a near-term basis. Additionally, we have guaranteed the funding of certain tax, insurance, and non-conforming property reserves related to the financing of one of our joint ventures. We do not expect these guarantees to have a material current or future effect on our liquidity. See Part IV. Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statements of — Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nGeneral economic conditions in the United States have fluctuated in recent quarters, and concerns persist regarding adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, elevated interest rates, political dissension, and labor shortfalls. Fluctuating economic conditions and uncertainty in financial markets may negatively impact our operating cash flow such that we are unable to make required debt service payments, which would result in an event of default for any debt instrument under whose loan agreement such payments were not made. Specifically, the collateral within individual borrower entities may underperform, resulting in cash flow shortfalls for debt service while consolidated cash flows are sufficient to fund our operations. If an event of default occurs for our mortgage loan or for our secured term loan, our loan agreements provide \n68\ncertain remedies, including our ability to fund shortfalls from consolidated cash flow; and such an event of default would not result in an immediate acceleration of the loan.\nOur real estate assets are illiquid in nature. A timely liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of short-term liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise, and we may need to source liquidity from other financing sources, such as the Revolving Facility which had an undrawn balance of $1,180.0 million as of December 31, 2024.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of, and non-recurring capital expenditures for, our homes, and principal and interest payments of our indebtedness. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt and equity securities, and property dispositions. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. Therefore, as a general matter, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances from our annual taxable income that could be used to meet our liquidity needs. Instead, we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts, if any, by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023: \nFor the Years\nEnded December 31,\n($ in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,081,805 \n$\n1,107,088 \n$\n(25,283)\n(2.3)\n%\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(465,870)\n(773,552)\n307,682 \n39.8 \n%\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n(1,093,726)\n110,021 \n(1,203,747)\nN/M\nChange in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n(477,791)\n$\n443,557 \n$\n(921,348)\n(207.7)\n%\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy level of our homes, the rental rates achieved on our leases, the collection of rent from our residents, and the amount of our operating and other expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,081.8 million and $1,107.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n, a decrease of 2.3%. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to \nsettlement costs of $77.0 million included in net income that resolved an inquiry from the FTC and the legal dispute entitled \nCity of San Diego et al v. Invitation Homes, Inc., \ninclusive of associated costs. This decrease is partially offset by $36.4 million of unpaid estimated costs for hurricane related damages that are reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities consists primarily of the acquisition costs of homes, capital improvements, proceeds from property sales, and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Net cash used in investing activities was $465.9 million and $773.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a\n decrease of $307.7 million. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the combined effect of the following significant changes in cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023: \n(1) a \ndecrease in cash used for the acquisition of homes; \n(2) an increase in cash proceeds received from the sale of single-family homes;\n (3) \nan increase in cash used for investments in joint ventures\n; and (4) an increase in cash provided\n from\n repayment proceeds from retained debt securities\n. Acquisition spend decreased by $234.0 million from period to period due to a decrease in the number of homes acquired from 2,877 during the year ended December 31, 2023 to 2,072 homes acquired during the year ended December 31, 2024. Proceeds from the sale of single-family homes increased $97.1 million due to an increase in the number of homes sold from 1,423 during the year ended December 31, 2023 to 1,501 homes sold during the year ended December 31, 2024 and an increase in average net proceeds per home. Cash invested in joint ventures increased $43.7 million from period to period as a result of the formation of new joint ventures during 2024. \n69\nProceeds from repayment of retained debt securities increased $31.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024 due to the full repayment of IH 2018-4 during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,093.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $110.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change between periods is primarily due to the following financing transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued $494.3 million of unsecured notes, net of discount, and refinanced the 2020 Credit Facility. The proceeds were used to repay the existing credit facility and $645.7 million of mortgage loans, including the voluntary prepayment of the IH 2018-4 mortgage loan, and to fund $54.2 million of financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued $790.1 million of unsecured notes, net of discount, and used the proceeds to fund $7.8 million of financing costs and increase cash reserves for general corporate purposes\n. W\ne also made dividend and distribution payments totaling \n$692.6 million\n during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $640.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, which were funded by cash flows from operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nFor similar operating and financial data and discussion of our results for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Part II.

As of December 31, 2024, our remaining equity commitments to our joint ventures total $177.0 million.\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\nIn March 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and created Rule 13-01 to simplify disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities. The amendments became effective on January 4, 2021. INVH, INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub, LLC (“IH Merger Sub”) have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering, among other securities, debt securities of INVH LP, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by INVH, the General Partner, and/or IH Merger Sub. As a result of the amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company’s consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is “full and unconditional” and, subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub have not been presented.\nFurthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub, because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of INVH, INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors.\nPurchase of Outstanding Debt Securities or Loans\nAs market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt or debt securities that we may issue in the future, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our consolidated balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our Credit Facility. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for United States federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nOur discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. For a discussion of recently-issued and adopted accounting standards, see Part IV. Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules — Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting estimates that management believes are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\n71\nInvestments in Single-Family Residential Properties\nThe following significant accounting policies affect the acquisition, disposition, recognition, classification, and fair value measurements (on a nonrecurring basis) related to our owned portfolio of approximately 85,000 single-family residentia\nl properties located primarily in 16 core markets across the United States as of December 31, 2024\n \n. For a complete discussion of our accounting policy and other factors related to each category below, see Part IV. Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules — Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”\n•\nAcquisition of Real Estate Assets: \nOur purchases of homes are generally treated as asset acquisitions unless acquired in connection with a business combination. For asset acquisitions, homes are recorded at their purchase price, which is allocated between land, building and improvements, and in-place lease intangibles (when a resident is in place at the acquisition date) based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price for purposes of this allocation is inclusive of acquisition costs which typically include legal fees, bidding service and title fees, payments made to cure tax, utility, HOA, and other mechanic’s and miscellaneous liens, as well as other closing costs. The attributes and location of each home acquired are considered at the individual home level when determining the percentage of purchase price allocated to building and improvements versus land. As such, these allocation percentages vary based on the homes acquired during each reporting period. If the percentage allocated to buildings and improvements versus land for the homes acquired during the year ended December 31, 2024 was increased or decreased by 500 bps, our annualized depreciation expense would have changed by approximately $1.1 million. \n•\nCost Capitalization: \nWe incur costs to acquire, stabilize, and prepare our single-family residential properties to be leased. We capitalize these costs as a component of our investment in each single-family residential property, using specific identification and relative allocation methodologies. The capitalization period associated with our stabilization activities begins at the time that such activities commence and concludes at the time that a single-family residential property is available to be leased.\nOnce a property is ready for its intended use, expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs thereafter are expensed to operations as incurred, and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home\n \nand for certain furniture and fixtures additions.\nThe capitalized costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. The weighted average useful lives range from 7 to 32 years. If the useful lives for costs capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2024 were increased or decreased by 10%, our annualized depreciation expense would have changed by approximately $5.0 million.\n•\nProvisions for Impairment: \nWe continuously evaluate, by property, whether there are any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of our single-family residential properties may not be recoverable. \nTo the extent an event or change in circumstance is identified, a residential property is considered to be impaired only if its carrying value cannot be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the property. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the carrying amount of our investment in a property is adjusted to its estimated fair value. The process whereby we assess our single-family residential properties for impairment requires significant judgment and assessment of factors that are, at times, subject to significant uncertainty. We evaluate multiple information sources and perform a number of internal analyses, each of which are important components of our process with no one information source or analysis being necessarily determinative. \nThere have not been any significant process changes in our review for impairment during the current reporting period. For those homes for which a change in an event or circumstance was identified in the most recent impairment analysis, a 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of those homes may have resulted in an increase in impairment expense of $0.4 million.\n•\nSingle-Family Residential Properties Held for Sale:\n From time to time, we may identify single-family residential properties to be sold. Once we identify a property to be sold pursuant to GAAP requirements, we cease depreciating the property, measure the property at the lower of its carrying amount or its fair value less estimated costs to sell, and present the property separately within other assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, 237 homes, approximately 0.3% of our portfolio, were held for sale, compared to 189 homes as of December 31, 2023. If market values less disposal costs for our properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024 were 10% lower or higher, our impairment expense related to those properties would have changed by approximately $0.4 million.\n72\nSegment Reporting \nOur principal business is acquiring, renovating, leasing, operating, and managing single-family residential properties. Under the provisions of ASC 280, \nSegment Reporting\n, we have determined that we currently operate in \none\n reportable segment.\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). We concluded that we have \none\n reportable segment based on the way our CODM regularly reviews internally reported financial information to evaluate performance, make operating decisions, and allocate resources at a consolidated level. Net income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations is a primary metric utilized by the CODM to analyze the performance of the segment, including budget versus actual performance, and to allocate resources.\nNon-GAAP Measures \nEBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre \nEBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n are supplemental, non-GAAP measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. We define EBITDA as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before the following items: interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) recommends as a best practice that REITs that report an EBITDA performance measure also report EBITDA\nre\n. Consistent with the Nareit definition, we define EBITDA\nre\n as EBITDA, further adjusted for the following: gain on sale of property, net of tax; and impairment on depreciated real estate investments. Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is defined as EBITDA\nre\n before the following items: share-based compensation expense; severance; casualty (gains) losses, net; (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, net; and other income and expenses. Where appropriate, EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA are adjusted for our share of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nEBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks. Set forth below is additional detail on how management uses EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n as measures of performance.\nOur management uses EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n in a number of ways to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance, and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in identifying trends in our performance. EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance, while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results. Accordingly, we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely our cost structure and expenses.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is net income or loss. EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n may not be comparable to the EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.\n73\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n($ in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n453,164 \n$\n518,774 \n$\n382,668 \nNet income available to participating securities\n753 \n696 \n661 \nNon-controlling interests\n1,448 \n1,558 \n1,470 \nInterest expense\n366,070 \n333,457 \n304,092 \nInterest expense in unconsolidated joint ventures\n26,333 \n18,255 \n3,581 \nDepreciation and amortization\n714,326 \n674,287 \n638,114 \nDepreciation and amortization of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n13,377 \n10,469 \n5,838 \nEBITDA\n1,575,471 \n1,557,496 \n1,336,424 \nGain on sale of property, net of tax\n(244,550)\n(183,540)\n(90,699)\nImpairment on depreciated real estate investments\n506 \n427 \n310 \nNet (gain) loss on sale of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n1,215 \n(1,668)\n(865)\nEBITDA\nre\n1,332,642 \n1,372,715 \n1,245,170 \nShare-based compensation expense\n(1)\n27,918 \n29,503 \n28,962 \nSeverance expense\n637 \n977 \n314 \nCasualty losses, net\n(2)\n82,700 \n8,200 \n28,485 \n(Gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net\n(1,046)\n(350)\n3,939 \nOther, net\n(3)\n54,032 \n2,435 \n11,261 \nAdjusted EBITDA\nre\n$\n1,496,883 \n$\n1,413,480 \n$\n1,318,131 \n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, $5,830, $6,963, and $6,493, was recorded in property management expense, respectively, and $22,088, $22,540, and $22,469, was recorded in general and administrative expense, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures. The year ended December 31, 2024 includes $55,100 of estimated losses and damages related to Hurricanes Milton, Beryl, Debby, and Helene.

We define NOI for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense (which consists primarily of property taxes, insurance, HOA fees (when applicable), market-level personnel expenses, utility expenses, repairs and maintenance, and property administration). NOI excludes: interest expense; depreciation and amortization; property management expense; general and administrative expense; casualty losses, impairment, and other; gain on sale of property, net of tax; (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, net; other income and expenses; management fee revenues; and income (losses) from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe consider NOI to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe NOI is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to NOI is net income or loss. NOI is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our NOI may not be comparable to the NOI of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of NOI. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measure is comparable with that of other companies.\nWe believe that Same Store NOI is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as NOI and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting NOI for homes in our Same Store portfolio.\n74\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) to NOI for our total portfolio and NOI for our Same Store portfolio for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n($ in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n453,164 \n$\n518,774 \n$\n382,668 \nNet income available to participating securities\n753 \n696 \n661 \nNon-controlling interests\n1,448 \n1,558 \n1,470 \nInterest expense\n366,070 \n333,457 \n304,092 \nDepreciation and amortization\n714,326 \n674,287 \n638,114 \nProperty management expense\n(1)\n137,490 \n95,809 \n87,936 \nGeneral and administrative\n(2)\n90,612 \n82,344 \n74,025 \nCasualty losses, impairment, and other\n(3)\n82,925 \n8,596 \n28,697 \nGain on sale of property, net of tax\n(244,550)\n(183,540)\n(90,699)\n(Gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net\n(1,046)\n(350)\n3,939 \nOther, net\n(4)\n54,032 \n2,435 \n11,261 \nManagement fee revenues\n(69,978)\n(13,647)\n(11,480)\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n28,445 \n17,877 \n9,606 \nNOI (total portfolio)\n1,613,691 \n1,538,296 \n$\n1,440,290 \nNon-Same Store NOI\n(113,290)\n(104,116)\nNOI (Same Store portfolio)\n(5)\n$\n1,500,401 \n$\n1,434,180 \n(1)\nIncludes $5,830, $6,963, and $6,493 of share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes $22,088, $22,540, and $22,469 of share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(3)\nIncludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures. The year ended December 31, 2024 includes $55,100 of estimated losses and damages related to Hurricanes Milton, Beryl, Debby, and Helene. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes $24,000\n of net estimated losses and damages related to Hurricanes Ian and Nicole\n.\n(4)\nIncludes settlement and other costs related to certain litigation and regulatory matters, interest income, and other miscellaneous income and expenses.\n(5)\nThe Same Store portfolio totaled 76,601 homes for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n75\nFunds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations, and Adjusted Funds from Operations \nFunds From Operations (“FFO”), Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO are supplemental, non-GAAP measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. FFO is defined by Nareit as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus depreciation, amortization and impairment of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe believe that FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization. Because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management considers FFO an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciated real estate investments, gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes, as well non-controlling interests, from net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP). By excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate, management uses FFO to measure returns on its investments in homes. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes, all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited.\nManagement also believes that FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FFO is net income or loss. FFO is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our FFO may not be comparable to the FFO of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of FFO. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.\nWe believe that Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as FFO and are further helpful to investors as they provide a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period. We define Core FFO as FFO adjusted for the following (including adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures, as applicable): non-cash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs, loan discounts, and non-cash interest expense from derivatives; share-based compensation expense; legal settlements; severance expense; casualty (gains) losses, net; and (gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net, as applicable. We define Adjusted FFO as Core FFO less recurring capital expenditures, including adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures, that are necessary to help preserve the value, and maintain the functionality, of our homes. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Core FFO and Adjusted FFO is net income or loss. Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our Core FFO and Adjusted FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO and Adjusted FFO of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of Core FFO and Adjusted FFO. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.\n76\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) to FFO, Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except shares and per share data)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n453,164 \n$\n518,774 \n$\n382,668 \nAdd (deduct) adjustments from net income to derive FFO:\nNet income available to participating securities\n753 \n696 \n661 \nNon-controlling interests\n1,448 \n1,558 \n1,470 \nDepreciation and amortization on real estate assets\n699,474 \n663,398 \n629,301 \nImpairment on depreciated real estate investments\n506 \n427 \n310 \nNet gain on sale of previously depreciated investments in real estate\n(244,550)\n(183,540)\n(90,699)\nDepreciation and net gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n14,479 \n8,704 \n4,907 \nFFO\n925,274 \n1,010,017 \n928,618 \nNon-cash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs, loan discounts, and non-cash interest expense from derivatives\n(1)\n44,681 \n36,069 \n24,326 \nShare-based compensation expense\n(2)\n27,918 \n29,503 \n28,962 \nLegal settlements\n(3)\n77,000 \n2,000 \n7,400 \nSeverance expense\n637 \n977 \n314 \nCasualty losses, net\n(1)(4)\n82,700 \n8,200 \n28,485 \n(Gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net\n(1,046)\n(350)\n3,939 \nCore FFO\n1,157,164 \n1,086,416 \n1,022,044 \nRecurring capital expenditures\n(1)\n(170,927)\n(163,051)\n(156,147)\nAdjusted FFO\n$\n986,237 \n$\n923,365 \n$\n865,897 \nNet income available to common stockholders\nWeighted average common shares outstanding — diluted\n(5)(6)(7)\n613,631,617 \n613,288,708 \n611,112,396 \nNet income per common share — diluted\n(5)(6)(7)\n$\n0.74 \n$\n0.85 \n$\n0.63 \nFFO, Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO\nWeighted average common shares and OP Units outstanding — diluted\n(5)(6)(7)\n615,881,670 \n615,367,734 \n613,669,133 \nFFO per common share — diluted\n(5)(6)(7)\n$\n1.50 \n$\n1.64 \n$\n1.51 \nCore FFO per common share — diluted\n(5)(6)(7)\n$\n1.88 \n$\n1.77 \n$\n1.67 \nAFFO per common share — diluted\n(5)(6)(7)\n$\n1.60 \n$\n1.50 \n$\n1.41 \n(1)\nIncludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures.\n(2)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, $5,830, $6,963, and $6,493, was recorded in property management expense, respectively, and $22,088, $22,540, and $22,469, was recorded in general and administrative expense, respectively. \n(3)\nThe year ended December 31, 2024, includes $77,000 of settlement costs that resolved an inquiry from the FTC and the legal dispute entitled \nCity of San Diego et al v.

The year ended December 31, 2022, includes the estimated cost of a global settlement of a multistate putative class action regarding resident late fees.\n(4)\nThe year ended December 31, 2024 includes $55,100 of estimated losses and damages related to Hurricanes Milton, Beryl, Debby, and Helene. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes $24,000\n of net estimated losses and damages related to Hurricanes Ian and Nicole\n.\n77\n(5)\nIn connection with the Starwood Waypoint Homes (“SWH”) merger, we assumed certain convertible senior notes including $345,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% convertible senior notes due 2022 issued by SWH in January 2017 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”). On January 18, 2022, we settled the $141,490 outstanding principal balance of the 2022 Convertible Notes with the issuance of 6,216,261 shares of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the shares of common stock issued with respect to this settlement are included within all net income, FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO per common share calculations subsequent to the conversion date.\n(6)\nIncremental shares attributed to non-vested share-based awards totaling 1,080,300, 1,394,924, and 1,341,786 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, are included in weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of net income per common share — diluted. For the computations of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO per common share — diluted, common share equivalents of 1,376,141, 1,638,264, and 1,559,524 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, related to incremental shares attributed to non-vested share-based awards are included in the denominator.\n(7)\nVested units of partnership interests in INVH LP (“OP Units”) have been excluded from the computation of net income per common share — diluted for the periods above because all net income attributable to the vested OP Units has been recorded as non-controlling interest and thus excluded from net income available to common stockholders. Weighted average vested OP Units of 1,954,212, 1,835,686, and 2,338,999 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, are included in the denominator for the computations of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO per common share — diluted.",
