Our teams partner with biopharma companies, care providers, pharmacies, manufacturers, governments, and others to deliver insights, products, and services to help make quality care more accessible and affordable.\nThe Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year refers to the Company’s fiscal year.

This segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate sites) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.\nOur RxTS segment helps solve medication access, affordability and adherence challenges for patients by working across healthcare to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma companies. RxTS serves our biopharma and life sciences partners, delivering innovative solutions that help people get the medicine they need to live healthier lives. RxTS offers technology services, which includes electronic prior authorization, prescription price transparency, benefit insight, and dispensing support services, in addition to third-party logistics and wholesale distribution support designed to benefit stakeholders.\nOur Medical-Surgical Solutions segment provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, and home health care agencies. We offer more than 245,000 national brand medical-surgical products as well as McKesson’s own line of high-quality products through a network of distribution centers in the U.S.\nOur International segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in Canada and Norway where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies, and support better, safer patient care by delivering vital medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions. During fiscal 2025, we completed the sale of Rexall and Well.ca businesses in Canada. Refer to \nFinancial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,”\n, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Segment:\nOur U.S. Pharmaceutical segment provides distribution and logistics services for branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and OTC pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products to customers. This business provides solutions and services to pharmacies, hospitals, oncology and other specialty practices, pharmaceutical manufacturers, biopharma partners, physicians, payors, and patients throughout the U.S. We also source generic pharmaceutical drugs through our ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP joint venture with Walmart Inc. (“ClarusONE”).\nOur U.S. Pharmaceutical segment operates and serves customers through a network of 27 distribution centers in the U.S., including two strategic redistribution centers. We invest in technology and other systems at all of our distribution centers to enhance safety, reliability, and product availability. For example, we offer McKesson Connect\nSM\n, an internet-based ordering system that provides item look-up and real-time inventory availability as well as ordering, purchasing, third-party reconciliation, and account management functionality. We make extensive use of technology as an enabler to ensure customers have the right products at the right time in the right place.\nTo maximize distribution efficiency and effectiveness, we follow the Six Sigma methodology, which is an analytical approach that emphasizes setting high-quality objectives, collecting data, and analyzing results to a fine degree in order to improve processes, reduce costs, and enhance service accuracy and safety. We provide solutions to our customers including supply management technology, world-class marketing programs, managed care, repackaging products, and services to help them meet their business and quality goals. We continue to implement information systems to help achieve greater consistency and accuracy both internally and for our customers, as well as make investments to increase capacity and automation.\nWe have four primary customer pharmaceutical distribution channels: (i) retail national accounts, which include national and regional retail chains, food and drug combinations, mail order pharmacies, and mass merchandisers, (ii) community pharmacies and health (formerly described as independent, small, and medium chain retail pharmacies), (iii) institutional healthcare providers such as hospitals, health systems, integrated delivery networks, and long-term care providers, and (iv) oncology, biopharma, and other specialty partners.\n4\nTable of Contents\nItem 1 Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nRetail National Accounts: \nWe provide business solutions that help our retail national account customers increase revenues and profitability.

Community-based physicians in this business have broad flexibility and discretion to select the products and commitment levels that best meet their practice needs. Services in provider solutions include specialty drug distribution, group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) like Onmark\n®\n, technology solutions, practice consulting services, and vaccine distribution, including our exclusive distributor relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (“CDC”) Vaccines for Children program.\nThis business provides a variety of solutions, including practice operations, healthcare information technology, revenue cycle management and managed care contracting solutions, evidence-based guidelines, and quality measurements to support The U.S. Oncology Network (“USON”), one of the nation’s largest networks of physician-led, integrated, community-based oncology practices dedicated to advancing high-quality, evidence-based cancer care. SCRI Oncology, LLC, an oncology research business in which we own a 51% controlling interest, is one of the nation’s largest research networks and specializes in enhancing clinical trial access and availability across the country.\nThis segment includes Ontada\n®\n, McKesson’s oncology technology and insights business providing software to support the clinical, financial, and operational needs of our oncology practice customers. Ontada also partners with oncology providers and biopharma partners to perform real-world evidence studies, retrospective research, and to provide clinical data insights, advisory solutions and education opportunities.\nWhen we discuss specialty products or services, we consider the following factors: diseases requiring complex treatment regimens such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; plasma and biologics products; ongoing clinical monitoring requirements, high-cost, special handling, storage, and delivery requirements and, in some cases, exclusive distribution arrangements. Our use of the term “specialty” may not be comparable to that used by other industry participants, including our competitors.\n6\nTable of Contents\nItem 1 Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nPrescription Technology Solutions Segment:\nOur Prescription Technology Solutions segment works across healthcare to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma to deliver medication access solutions that support patients from first prescription fill to ongoing therapy, regardless of their insurance coverage. RxTS has connections with most electronic health record systems, over 50,000 pharmacies, approximately 950,000 providers, most pharmacy benefit managers and health plans, and has supported over 650 biopharma brands representing most therapeutic areas. Through its industry connections and ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystem, RxTS offers innovative solutions created to benefit healthcare stakeholders. Its comprehensive solution suites and technology services span across the entire patient journey, including medication access and affordability, prescription decision support, prescription price transparency, benefit insight and dispensing support services, as well as third-party logistics and wholesale distribution support, to help increase speed to therapy, reduce prescription abandonment, and support improved health outcomes for the patient. In the past year, RxTS helped patients save more than $10 billion on brand and specialty medications, helped to prevent an estimated 12 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and helped patients access their medicine more than 100 million times.\nMedical-Surgical Solutions Segment: \nOur Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivers medical-supply distribution, logistics, biomedical maintenance, and other services to healthcare providers across the alternate-site spectrum. Our more than 340,000 customers include physician offices, surgery centers, post-acute care facilities, hospital reference labs, and home health agencies. We partner with manufacturers and channel partners to support our key target end-markets, including primary care, extended care, government, and other markets. We distribute medical-surgical supplies (such as gloves, needles, syringes, and wound care products), infusion pumps, laboratory equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Through a network of distribution centers in the U.S., we offer more than 245,000 products from national brand manufacturers and McKesson’s own brand of high-quality products. Through the right mix of products and services, we help improve efficiencies, profitability, and compliance. We also never lose focus on helping customers improve patient and business outcomes. We develop customized plans to address the product, operational, and clinical support needs of our customers, including inventory management, reducing administrative burdens, and training and educating clinical staff. We deliver for our customers, so they can deliver and care for their patients. In May 2025, the Company announced its intention to separate this segment into an independent company.\nInternational Segment:\nOur International segment includes operations in Canada and Norway. McKesson Canada is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and retail distributors in Canada. The wholesale business delivers products to retail pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, clinics and institutions in Canada through a national network of distribution centers and provides logistics and distribution services for manufacturers.\nBeyond wholesale pharmaceutical logistics and distribution, McKesson Canada provides automation and technology solutions to its retail and hospital customers. Additionally, McKesson Canada provides comprehensive specialty health services to Canadians and provides biopharma services to manufacturers, including a national network of specialty pharmacies, personalized patient care and support programs, and INVIVA, Canada’s first and largest accredited network of private infusion clinics. McKesson Canada also owns and operates PDCI, Canada’s leading market access consultancy, supporting manufacturers as they introduce new products into the Canadian market.\nThe Canada retail business includes approximately 2,700 banner pharmacies under the IDA\n®\n, Guardian\n®\n, The Medicine Shoppe\n®\n, Remedy’sRx\n®\n, Proxim\n®\n, and Uniprix\n®\n banners. During fiscal 2025, we completed the previously announced transaction to sell our Rexall and Well.ca businesses. This divestiture is further described in \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report\n.\nIn July 2021, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in Europe. We divested the majority of our European businesses during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Our remaining operations in Europe provide distribution and services to wholesale and retail customers in Norway where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies. We continue to evaluate suitable exit alternatives for our retail and distribution businesses in Norway. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our European divestitures.\n7\nTable of Contents\nItem 1 Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nInvestments, Restructuring, Business Combinations, and Divestitures \nWe invest in new and existing distribution centers to increase scale and capacity, improve efficiency through automation and technology, and enhance regulatory compliance capabilities. Additionally, we invest in data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including artificial intelligence (“AI”). We are in the early stages of exploring potential AI capabilities and related data and analytics across our enterprise to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as enhance our products and services to better support patients, employees, and customers. \nWe have undertaken additional strategic initiatives in recent years designed to increase operational efficiencies, focus on our core healthcare businesses, execute our business strategy, and enhance our competitive position. These initiatives are detailed in \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n,\n” and \nFinancial \nNote 3\n, “\nRestructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive environments in North America and Norway. In recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. In the pharmaceutical distribution environment in which our U.S. Pharmaceutical and International segments operate, we face strong competition from international, national, regional, and local full-line, short-line, and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies, and large payer organizations. We consider our largest competitors in distribution, wholesaling, and logistics to be Cencora, Inc. and Cardinal Health, Inc.\nOur RxTS business experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other biopharma services companies, software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition in this business varies in size from large to small companies, in geographical coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.\nOur Medical-Surgical Solutions segment experiences competition from a wide range of national and regional medical supply and equipment distributors throughout the U.S.\nIn addition, we compete with other service providers and healthcare manufacturers, as well as other potential customers of our businesses, which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses. We believe that our scale and diversity of product and service offerings are our primary competitive advantages. In all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation, adoption of new and evolving technologies, and, in some cases, convenience to the customer. \nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Licenses\nMcKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services. We pursue patent protection for our innovations and obtain copyright protection for our original works of authorship when such protection is advantageous. Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nWe believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson’s confidential information, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers. We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. \n8\nTable of Contents\nItem 1 Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nWe hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson’s products or services. While in the future it may be necessary to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations as well as our products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.\nHuman Capital\nEverything we do at McKesson begins with our employees, who bring our mission and purpose to life every day. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 45,000 employees worldwide, which includes 2,000 part-time employees. We had approximately 36,000 employees in the U.S., 5,000 employees in Canada, and 4,000 employees in the rest of the world. We also supplement our work-force with contractors and/or consultants for certain business projects, processes, and/or operations as demand requires.\nCulture and Leadership\n: One of McKesson’s defining characteristics is our strong culture. We take pride in fostering a sense of belonging, finding meaning in our work, and caring for each other, our customers, and all those who depend on us. Our I\n2\nCARE values (Integrity, Inclusion, Customer-First, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) and ILEAD leadership behaviors (Inspire, Leverage, Execute, Advance, Develop) are at the core of our daily actions – from how we interact with each other and our customers, to how we make decisions, both big and small. We also offer all employees the opportunity to join employee resource groups (“ERGs”), which are voluntary, employee-led, company-sponsored networks that aim to make a positive impact on our employees’ lives. Each ERG is non-exclusive and open to every employee. Our ERGs focus on helping employees make authentic connections, celebrate and learn from each other, showcase leadership skills and find ways to nurture and support belonging and empowerment.\nInvestment in Employees: \nWe are committed to investing in our employees, so that they, in turn, can focus on furthering our purpose of Advancing Health Outcomes for All\n®\n. We offer employees health and wellness benefits focused on physical, mental, and social well-being, savings programs to help prepare them for retirement and flexible work arrangements, and other offerings. We also offer employees regular training, coaching, and 360-degree assessments, and financial assistance programs for higher education opportunities.\nWe seek to attract and retain the best talent through competitive compensation and pay for performance, while prioritizing recognition of merit and compliance with laws. Our compensation philosophy is rooted in a fair and transparent program that regularly conducts benchmarking to assess market rates for talent, based on geography and other factors. \nWe solicit employee feedback through annual and mid-year employee opinion surveys, which assesses our employees’ levels of engagement, commitment and overall satisfaction using industry benchmarks, and then design action plans to improve those metrics. We also seek feedback on our people leaders through our annual manager quality survey, which is an opportunity for employees to help their managers grow professionally and build valuable leadership skills that help to promote a positive and productive workplace.\nHealth and Safety\n: Our security and safety teams employ systems designed to continually monitor our facilities and work environment to help identify and prevent or mitigate risks. This includes having procedures and investing in equipment for both physical and electronic security. Our employees receive specialized training related to their role, work setting, and equipment used in their work environment.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in many highly regulated environments and are subject to oversight by various federal, state, and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere. We incur significant expense and make large capital expenditures and investments to enable us to comply with laws and guidance promulgated by governmental entities. \nThe regulatory framework affecting our business and industry is continuously evolving and influenced by conditions such as public policy developments; shifts in governmental priorities, initiatives, and focus areas, including due to changes in federal, state, and local representation; and varied interpretations of laws and agency rulemaking conventions. These conditions create uncertainties for our business, and we are unable to predict the impact of future changes to the regulatory framework, or any prolonged uncertainty, on our operations and compliance costs.\n9\nTable of Contents\nItem 1 Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nSee “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I below for information regarding material risks associated with our compliance with governmental regulations.\nOperational Licenses and Permits; Controlled Substances:\n We are subject to the operating and security standards of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, and comparable agencies in the U.S. and other countries. Certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with governmental agencies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. For example, we are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. We maintain extensive controlled substance monitoring and reporting programs at considerable expense in order to help us meet those standards.\nGovernment Contracts: \nOur contracts with governmental entities typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting, and other requirements. These statutory and regulatory requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden. We are subject to audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings about our compliance with contractual and legal requirements. \nHealthcare Program Regulation\n: Federal, state, and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere continue to strengthen their position on, and scrutiny of, practices that may indicate fraud, waste, and abuse affecting government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers, healthcare providers, and other companies and individuals, as well as our provision of products and services to governmental entities, subject our business to statutes, regulations, and government guidance that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse. Among other things, those laws: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of an individual for, or to induce the ordering or purchasing of, items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs; (2) prohibit physicians from referring certain “designated health services” to an entity with which they have a financial relationship, unless an exception applies; and (3) prohibit knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government; and (4) require certain entities to report and return an overpayment by Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. \nMany of these healthcare fraud and abuse laws are vague or indefinite and are often subject to varied and evolving interpretations by courts, regulators, and enforcing agencies and, as such, may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations at added expense. \nIn the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payors. The implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) has begun to change benefit design and how Medicare pays for drugs, which are all intended to reduce the price of drugs. Three central features of the IRA have authorized the government to negotiate drug prices for certain Parts B and D drugs over time, establish an inflation rebate program, and cap patient cost sharing under Medicare Part D. \nProvincial governments in Canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. For example, provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic drug manufacturers.\nMcKesson continues to advocate for policies that would improve drug cost transparency under a patient's drug plan to better inform prescribing decisions, and also address access to care, affordability, and treatment regimen adherence, all designed to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the health spending burden.\nFDA Regulation and Supply Chain Integrity:\n In the U.S., the FDA is the principal federal authority that regulates the safety, efficacy, quality, testing, premarket approval, manufacture, labeling, storage, distribution, and post-market surveillance of healthcare products, such as drugs and medical devices, foods, and cosmetics.\n10\nTable of Contents\nItem 1 Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFederal and state laws regulate the pharmaceutical drug supply chain in order to prevent the distribution of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful prescription drugs in interstate commerce. At the federal level, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), among other things, requires standardized, unit-level traceability of pharmaceutical products along the entire drug supply chain and requires all trading partners to cooperate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system. In October 2024, the FDA extended the compliance deadlines for the DSCSA interoperable unit-level traceability requirements to May 27, 2025, for manufacturers, August 27, 2025 for distributors, and November 27, 2025 for dispensers. The FDA stated that these extensions apply to trading partners who meet certain conditions. The Company believes its businesses are eligible for the extensions. The DSCSA also sets forth national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistic providers and other requirements applicable to these entities and the FDA has issued a proposed rule with respect to these requirements. These federal and state regulatory requirements have increased, and may further increase, our compliance burden and distribution costs.\nAdditionally, federal and state governments may adopt other laws intended to protect the integrity of the supply chain, and those laws could affect our distribution business. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and HHS issued a request for public comment in 2024 on how the practices of pharmaceutical wholesalers and group purchasing organizations impact generic drug shortages. Various industry stakeholders responded to this request, but no further action has been taken by the FTC or HHS. \nCybersecurity, Data Security, Privacy, and AI: \nWe are subject to many cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our efforts to comply with these laws complicate our operations and add to our costs. We are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada, and an expanding list of comprehensive state privacy laws in the U.S. Some privacy laws may prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions or otherwise limit our use and disclosure of data. Many of these laws also require us to provide access or other data rights (modification, deletion, portability, etc.) to consumers’ and patients’ individual personal data records within specified periods of time. Cybersecurity laws such as the federal Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, proposed changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and SEC reporting requirements may require us to provide notifications of certain cybersecurity incidents within short timeframes. Regulations and guidance targeting critical infrastructure entities, including McKesson, continue to be a focus of regulators. We are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various governmental agencies. There is also an emerging trend of governmental entities proposing and providing regulatory guidance related to AI, including generative AI. If we or our third-party providers are restricted from using AI as a result of any regulatory views, laws or other measures, it could impact our operations, increase our compliance expense and burden, and cause us to incur costs to replace or modify our use of AI.\nEnvironmental Regulation: \nWe are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as laws governing the operation of radiation-emitting equipment at U.S. Oncology Network practices. \nWe sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain states have required and may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are described further in \nFinancial \nNote 17\n, “\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nClimate Change Regulation: \nGovernments in the U.S. and abroad have adopted or are considering new or expanded policies and laws to address climate change. Such policies and laws may necessitate reductions in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions; mandate that companies implement processes and controls to monitor and disclose climate-related matters; and impose additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, among other requirements. Compliance with climate-related policies and laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions. Methodologies for reporting climate-related information may change and previously reported information may be retroactively adjusted, if required. New or expanded climate-related policies and laws could impose costs on us, including capital expenditures to develop data gathering and reporting systems, third-party attestations, and additional GHG reduction measures. Until the timing and extent of climate-related policies and laws are clarified, including due to legal challenges, we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.\n11\nTable of Contents\nItem 1 Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nAntitrust Laws\n: Antitrust and competition laws in the U.S. and elsewhere prohibit types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare industry remains a focus of the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Some of our strategic transactions may require review by competition regulators, with inherent delays. Violations of the antitrust laws can result in sanctions and other adverse actions, including criminal and civil penalties. Private plaintiffs also may bring civil lawsuits for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. These laws contribute to our compliance efforts and expense, and their enforcement might materially adversely affect our operations and growth strategy.\nOther Information about the Business\nCustomers:\n During fiscal 2025, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 72% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 24% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2023, we extended our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS to June 2027. Our ten largest customers comprised approximately 48%, and CVS was approximately 23% of our total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2025. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies, and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. \nSuppliers: \nWe obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers and our largest supplier accounted for 11% of our total purchases in fiscal 2025. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound. The ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2025 accounted for approximately 69% of our total purchases.\nSome of our distribution arrangements with manufacturers provide us consideration based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based consideration component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin.\nResearch and Development:\n Research and development expenses were $91 million, $77 million, and $89 million for the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nFinancial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations:\n Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations is discussed in \nFinancial \nNote 20\n, “\nSegments of Business\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report as well as in “Foreign Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).\nOur fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year refer to our fiscal year.\nOur Financial Review within this Annual Report generally discusses fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 results and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. For a discussion of our year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8, 2024.\nCertain statements in this Annual Report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report for additional factors relating to these statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and liquidity, and results of operations.\nOverview of Our Business:\nWe are a diversified healthcare services leader dedicated to advancing health outcomes for patients everywhere. Our teams partner with biopharma companies, care providers, pharmacies, manufacturers, governments, and others to deliver insights, products, and services to help make quality care more accessible and affordable.\n31\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nWe report our financial results in four reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical, Prescription Technology Solutions (“RxTS”), Medical-Surgical Solutions, and International. Our organizational structure also includes Corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects, as well as the results of certain investments and operations. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit (loss) before interest expense and income taxes.\nThe following summarizes our four reportable segments. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 20\n, “\nSegments of Business\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding our reportable segments.\n•\nU.S. Pharmaceutical\n is a reportable segment that distributes branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products in the United States (“U.S.”). This segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate sites) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.\n•\nPrescription Technology Solutions\n is a reportable segment that combines automation and our ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystem to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma companies to address patients’ medication access, affordability, and adherence challenges. RxTS offers technology services, which includes electronic prior authorization, prescription price transparency, benefit insight, dispensing support services, in addition to third-party logistics, and wholesale distribution support across various therapeutic categories and temperature ranges to biopharma customers throughout the product lifecycle.\n•\nMedical-Surgical Solutions\n is a reportable segment that provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, and home health care agencies. This segment offers national brand medical-surgical products as well as McKesson’s own line of high-quality products through a network of distribution centers within the U.S. In May 2025, we announced our intention to separate this segment into an independent company.\n•\nInternational\n is a reportable segment that includes our operations in Canada and Norway, bringing together non-U.S.-based drug distribution services, specialty pharmacy, retail, and infusion care services. Our Canadian operations deliver medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions throughout Canada and included Rexall Health retail pharmacies. During fiscal 2025, we completed the sale of Rexall and Well.ca businesses in Canada (“Canadian retail disposal group”). This divestiture is further described in the “Canadian Divestiture Activities” section below. Our Norwegian operations provide distribution and services to wholesale and retail customers in Norway where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies.\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\nCommunity Oncology Revitalization Enterprise Ventures, LLC\nOn August 26, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 70% controlling interest in Community Oncology Revitalization Enterprise Ventures, LLC (“Core Ventures”), an internal business and administrative services organization established by Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute, LLC, for approximately $2.49 billion cash, subject to certain customary adjustments. Following the completion of the transaction, Core Ventures will be part of the Oncology platform, and financial results will be reported within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 expired in late April 2025. We expect the transaction to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2026, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nPRISM Vision Holdings, LLC\nOn April 2, 2025, we announced the completion of our previously announced acquisition of a controlling interest in PRISM Vision Holdings, LLC (“PRISM Vision”), a leading provider of general ophthalmology and retina management services. We purchased an approximate 80% and PRISM Vision physicians retained a 20% interest. The financial results of PRISM Vision will be reported within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.\n32\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nCanadian Divestiture Activities\nOn December 30, 2024, we completed the sale of our Canadian retail disposal group for an adjusted purchase price consisting of a cash payment of $9 million, received upon closing, and a note of $120 million, measured at fair value and accruing interest upon satisfaction of certain conditions, and payable to the Company at the end of six years. We recorded a charge of $667 million for the year ended March 31, 2025 in total operating expenses to remeasure the Canadian retail disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. The remeasurement adjustment includes a $48 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with the disposal group. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n,”\n, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.\nExecutive Summary:\nThe following summary provides highlights and key factors that impacted our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2025:\n•\nFor the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year, revenues increased by 16%, gross profit increased by 4%, total operating expenses were flat, and other income, net increased by $70 million. Refer to the \n“Overview of Consolidated Results”\n section below for an analysis of these changes;\n•\nDiluted earnings per common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation increased to $25.72 in fiscal 2025 from $22.39 in the prior year;\n•\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2025, we onboarded a new strategic partner within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment;\n•\nDuring fiscal 2025, we completed the sale of our Canadian retail disposal group and total operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2025 includes fair value remeasurement charges of $667 million;\n•\nFor the year ended March 31, 2025, we recorded restructuring charges of $298 million related to an enterprise-wide initiative to drive operational efficiencies as further described in the “Restructuring Initiatives” section of \n“Overview of Consolidated Results”\n below;\n•\nWe received $444 million for the year ended March 31, 2025 related to our share of antitrust legal settlements. This amount was recorded as a gain within “Cost of sales” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment;\n•\nFor the year ended March 31, 2025, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $258 million related to the sales of certain intellectual property between McKesson wholly-owned legal entities based in foreign tax jurisdictions;\n•\nWe recorded a charge of $108 million for the year ended March 31, 2025 related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims as further described in \nFinancial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report;\n•\nFor the \nyear ended March 31, 2025\n, we recognized a net gain of\n $100 million related to a recapitalization event of one of our investments in equity securities which resulted in an increase to the carrying value of this investment as discussed in \nFinancial Note 15, “Fair Value Measurements,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report;\n•\nOn September 10, 2024, we completed a public offering of 4.25% Notes due September 15, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) in a principal amount of $500 million. Proceeds received from this note issuance, net of discounts and offering expenses were approximately $496 million;\n•\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2025, we utilized the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes, along with cash on hand, to redeem our $500 million outstanding principal amount of 5.25% Notes due February 15, 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) prior to maturity; and\n•\nWe returned $3.5 billion of cash to shareholders during fiscal 2025 through $3.1 billion of common stock repurchases through open market transactions and $345 million of dividend payments. In July 2024, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an increase of $4.0 billion in the authorization for repurchase of the Company’s common stock and raised our quarterly dividend to $0.71 from $0.62 per share of common stock. The total remaining authorization outstanding for repurchases of the Company’s common stock at March 31, 2025 was $7.5 billion.\n33\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nTrends and Uncertainties:\nOpioid-Related Litigation and Claims \nAs described in the discussion of opioid-related matters in \nFinancial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we are a defendant in many legal proceedings asserting claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids) in federal and state courts throughout the U.S., and in Puerto Rico and Canada. Other than as to the settlements described in \nFinancial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,”\n, we have not concluded a loss is probable in any of the matters; nor is any possible loss or range of loss reasonably estimable. An adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations.\nRite Aid Bankruptcy Proceedings\nDuring fiscal 2024, our customer Rite Aid Corporation (including certain of its subsidiaries, “Rite Aid”) filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, we recorded a provision for bad debts of $725 million for the year ended March 31, 2024, representing the uncollected trade accounts receivable from sales to Rite Aid prior to its bankruptcy petition filing.\nRite Aid's restructuring plan was approved by the court and the company successfully emerged from bankruptcy in August 2024. During the year ended March 31, 2025, we reassessed our initial estimates made in conjunction with the previously reserved prepetition balances, including cash received during the period, resulting in a reversal of $206 million recorded within “Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and included within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. During the year ended March 31, 2025, we released $237 million of allowance for doubtful accounts against trade accounts receivables, representing the write-off of uncollectible receivables related to the Rite Aid provision in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. On May 5, 2025, Rite Aid filed a second voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nWe believe the reserves maintained and any adjustments recorded for Rite Aid trade accounts receivable are appropriate and consistent with our accounting policy and assessment of the information currently available. We evaluate our reserves periodically and as circumstances warrant, which may result in changes to our reserves. For additional disclosure of our policy regarding allowances for credit losses, refer to the \n“Critical Accounting Estimates”\n section included in this Financial Review.\n34\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of Consolidated Results:\n(In millions, except per share data)\nYears Ended March 31, \n2025\n2024\nChange\nRevenues\n$\n359,051 \n$\n308,951 \n16 \n%\nGross profit\n13,323 \n12,828 \n4 \nGross profit margin\n3.71 \n%\n4.15 \n%\n(44)\nbp\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n(8,901)\n$\n(8,919)\n— \n%\nTotal operating expenses as a percentage of revenues\n2.48 \n%\n2.89 \n%\n(41)\nbp\nOther income, net\n$\n202 \n$\n132 \n53 \n%\nInterest expense\n(265)\n(252)\n5 \nIncome before income taxes\n4,359 \n3,789 \n15 \nIncome tax expense\n(878)\n(629)\n40 \nReported income tax rate\n20.1 \n%\n16.6 \n%\n350 \nbp\nNet income\n3,481 \n3,160 \n10 \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(186)\n(158)\n18 \nNet income attributable to McKesson Corporation\n$\n3,295 \n$\n3,002 \n10 \n%\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation\n$\n25.72 \n$\n22.39 \n15 \n%\nWeighted-average diluted common shares outstanding\n128.1 \n134.1 \n(4)\n%\nAny percentage changes displayed above which are not meaningful are displayed as zero percent.\nbp - basis point\n35\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nRevenues\nRevenues increased for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year largely due to market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including higher volumes largely from retail national account customers and growth in specialty pharmaceuticals. Market growth includes growing drug utilization and newly launched products, partially offset by branded to generic drug conversion. This revenue growth was also favorably impacted by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in our International segment.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year primarily in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment driven by growth of specialty pharmaceuticals, growth from retail national account customers, and our share of antitrust legal settlements received in fiscal 2025, partially offset by last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory charges in fiscal 2025 and higher restructuring charges.\nGross profit for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 included gains of $444 million and $244 million, respectively, representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. We recognized these amounts within \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.\nGross profit for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 also included a LIFO charge of $82 million and a credit of $157 million, respectively. The LIFO charge in fiscal 2025 compared to a credit in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to higher brand inflation compared to the prior year. Refer to the \n“Critical Accounting Estimates”\n section included in this Financial Review for further information regarding the use of the LIFO method of accounting within our U.S. Pharmaceutical business.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2025 was impacted by an inventory impairment charge of $58 million related to restructuring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts as discussed in \nFinancial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,”\n to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. We recorded this amount\n \nrelated to impairment of inventories within \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.\nTotal Operating Expenses\nA summary and description of the components of our total operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 is as follows:\n•\nSelling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses (“SDG&A”):\n consists of personnel costs, transportation costs, depreciation and amortization, lease costs, professional fee expenses, administrative expenses, provision for bad debts and related recoveries, remeasurement charges to fair value less costs to sell, and other general charges.\n•\nClaims and litigation charges, net:\n These charges include adjustments for estimated probable settlements related to our controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. Legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred, are included within SDG&A.\n•\nRestructuring, impairment, and related charges, net:\n Charges recorded under this component include those incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted, as well as long-lived asset impairments. \n36\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nYears Ended March 31, \n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\nSelling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses\n$\n8,507 \n$\n8,657 \n(2)\n%\nClaims and litigation charges, net\n108 \n147 \n(27)\nRestructuring, impairment, and related charges, net\n286 \n115 \n149 \nTotal operating expenses\n$\n8,901 \n$\n8,919 \n— \n%\nPercent of revenues\n2.48 \n%\n2.89 \n%\n(41)\nbp\nAny percentage changes displayed above which are not meaningful are displayed as zero percent.\nbp - basis points\nTotal operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year.

The remeasurement adjustment includes a $48 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with this disposal. Of the total charges recorded during the period, $605 million are included within our International segment and $62 million are included within Corporate expenses, net;\n•\nSDG&A includes a credit of $206 million related to the bankruptcy of Rite Aid. Refer to the Rite Aid Bankruptcy Proceedings section of \n“\nTrends and Uncertainties\n”\n for further discussion;\n•\nClaims and litigation charges, net primarily consists of a charge of $108 million related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims as discussed in \nFinancial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report; and\n•\nRestructuring, impairment, and related charges, net of $286 million, are discussed below under “Restructuring Initiatives” as well as \nFinancial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nFiscal 2024\n•\nSDG&A includes a provision for bad debts of $725 million related to the bankruptcy of Rite Aid in October 2023. Refer to the Rite Aid Bankruptcy Proceedings section of \n“Trends and Uncertainties”\n for more information;\n•\nSDG&A includes a fair value adjustment gain of $78 million which reduced our contingent consideration liability related to the Rx Savings Solutions, LLC (“RxSS”) acquisition, as discussed in more detail in \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report;\n•\nSDG&A was impacted by lower operating expenses from the completed divestiture of our E.U. disposal group in fiscal 2023, as discussed in more detail in \nFinancial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report;\n•\nClaims and litigation charges, net primarily consists of a charge of $149 million related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims as discussed in \nFinancial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report; and\n•\nRestructuring, impairment, and related charges, net of $115 million are primarily related to Corporate expenses, net.

The annual impairment testing performed in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill, and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. However, other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods. Refer to the \n“Critical Accounting Estimates”\n included in this Financial Review for further information.\nRestructuring Initiatives\nWe recorded restructuring, impairment, and related charges of $286 million and $115 million for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These charges were included in “Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we approved enterprise-wide initiatives to modernize and accelerate our technology service operating model, which are intended to improve business continuity, compliance, operating efficiency and advance investments to streamline the organization. These initiatives include cost reduction efforts and support other rationalization efforts within Corporate, and the Medical-Surgical Solutions, and U.S. Pharmaceutical segments to help realize long-term sustainable growth. We anticipate total charges related to these initiatives of $650 million to $700 million, consisting primarily of employee severance and other employee-related costs as well as facility, exit and other related costs, including long-lived asset impairments. These programs are anticipated to be substantially complete in fiscal 2028. For the year ended March 31, 2025, we recorded charges of $240 million related to the initiatives, which primarily includes severance and other employee-related costs as well as facility exit and other related costs, including\n \nlong-lived asset impairments recorded within “Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and $58 million for the year ended March 31, 2025 related to inventory impairments recorded within “Cost of sales” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we approved a broad set of initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts, with the intent of simplifying our infrastructure and realizing long-term sustainable growth. These initiatives included headcount reductions and the exit or downsizing of certain facilities. We recorded charges of $45 million for the year ended March 31, 2024 related to this program. This restructuring program was substantially complete in fiscal 2024.\nRefer to \nFinancial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net increased for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to net gains of $101 million related to our investments in equity securities of certain U.S. growth stage companies in the healthcare industry and a favorable impact from interest income, partially offset by charges of $87 million related to the termination of the U.K. pension plan and a loss of $43 million related to one of our equity method investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased average balances of the Company’s loan portfolio in fiscal 2025, and a prior year gain on debt extinguishment of $9 million. These increases were partially offset by increased capitalized interest from higher capital spending, changes in our derivative portfolio in fiscal 2025, and a decline in commercial paper borrowings in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 11\n, “\nDebt and Financing Activities\n,” \nto the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information. Interest expense may fluctuate based on timing, amounts, and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, amounts and interest rates of commercial paper borrowings, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recorded income tax expense of $878 million and $629 million for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our reported income tax expense rates were 20.1% and 16.6% in 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n38\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nFluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes in our business mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions, including the impact of non-cash pre-tax charges related to the remeasurement of our Canadian retail disposal group to fair value less costs to sell as described in \nFinancial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,”\n and recognized discrete tax items.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2025, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $258 million related to the sales of certain intellectual property between McKesson wholly-owned legal entities based in foreign tax jurisdictions. For the year ended March 31, 2024, we recognized a net discrete tax benefits of $157 million related to the release of a valuation allowance based on management’s reassessment of the amount of our deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized and $104 million related to the repatriation and sale of certain intellectual property between McKesson wholly-owned legal entities that are based in different tax jurisdictions. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 6\n, “\nIncome Taxes\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.\nSignificant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 primarily represents the proportionate results of third-party equity interests in ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP, Vantage Oncology Holdings, LLC, and SCRI Oncology, LLC. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily driven by higher volumes in our ClarusONE joint venture.\nNet Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation\nNet income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $3.3 billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation was $25.72 and $22.39 for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our diluted earnings per share includes the cumulative effects of share repurchases during each period.\nWeighted-Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding \nDiluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted-average number of shares outstanding of 128.1 million and 134.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2025 decreased from the prior year primarily due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases, as discussed in the \n“\nShare Repurchases Plans\n”\n section of this Financial Review.\n39\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nOverview of Segment Results: \nSegment Revenues:\n \nYears Ended March 31, \n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\nSegment revenues\nU.S. Pharmaceutical\n$\n327,717 \n$\n278,739 \n18 \n%\nPrescription Technology Solutions\n5,216 \n4,769 \n9 \nMedical-Surgical Solutions\n11,386 \n11,313 \n1 \nInternational\n14,721 \n14,130 \n4 \nCorporate\n11 \n— \n— \nTotal revenues\n$\n359,051 \n$\n308,951 \n16 \n%\nAny percentage changes displayed above which are not meaningful are displayed as zero percent.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical\nU.S. Pharmaceutical revenues for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased $49.0 billion or 18% compared to the prior year. Within the segment, sales to pharmacies and healthcare providers increased $42.6 billion and sales to specialty practices and other increased $6.4 billion. Overall, these increases were primarily due to higher volumes from retail national account customers and growth in specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by branded to generic drug conversions.\nPrescription Technology Solutions\nRxTS revenues for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased $447 million or 9% compared to the prior year due to increased volumes from our third-party logistics and higher technology services revenues.\nMedical-Surgical Solutions\nMedical-Surgical Solutions revenues for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased $73 million or 1% compared to the prior year. Within the segment, sales to primary care customers increased $85 million, partially offset by other sales which declined $10 million driven by lower contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies used to administer COVID-19 vaccines, and sales to extended care customers which decreased $2 million.\nInternational\nInternational revenues for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased $591 million or 4% compared to the prior year which included $455 million unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Within the segment, sales in Canada increased by $950 million largely driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes and sales in Norway increased by $96 million primarily driven by growth in retail pharmacy.\nCorporate\nCorporate reflects revenues from services derived in the U.S. related to certain technology operations.

These increases were partially offset by a LIFO charge in fiscal 2025 compared to a credit in the prior year period, an increase in operating expenses to support higher volumes, a charge of $57 million related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims, and a loss related to one of our equity method investments.\nPrescription Technology Solutions\nOperating profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year primarily driven by contributions from technology services partially offset by the gain of $78 million recognized in the prior year resulting from a fair value adjustment of our contingent consideration liability related to the RxSS acquisition. \nMedical-Surgical Solutions\nOperating profit decreased for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2025 and a decline in the contribution from our primary care business, partially offset by lower expenses resulting from business rationalization initiatives.\nInternational\nOperating (loss) for this segment for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to an operating profit for the prior year was largely due to remeasurement charges related to our Canadian retail disposal group, as discussed in \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nCorporate\nCorporate expenses, net decreased for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year primarily due to a net gain of $101 million related to our investments in equity securities of certain U.S. growth stage companies in the healthcare industry, a favorable impact to interest income, and lower charges related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims. These were partially offset by a fiscal 2025 charge of $87 million related to the termination of the U.K. pension plan, remeasurement charges related to our Canadian retail disposal group, as discussed in \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, and higher restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year.\n42\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nFOREIGN OPERATIONS\nOur foreign operations represented approximately 4% and 5% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report for a risk factor related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and risks from trade and tariffs. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies, including the Canadian dollar and Euro. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency exchange fluctuations,” which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of our operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In computing the foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we translate our current year results of our operations in foreign countries recorded in local currencies into U.S. dollars by applying their respective average foreign currency exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods reported in U.S. dollars.\nIn fiscal 2025, we completed the sale of our Canadian retail disposal group. Refer to \nFinancial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,\n”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.\nAdditional information regarding our foreign operations is also included in Financial \nNote 20, “Segments of Business,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nRefer to \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.\nFISCAL 2026 OUTLOOK\nInformation regarding the Company’s fiscal 2026 outlook is contained in the release of our fourth quarter fiscal 2025 financial results included as an exhibit to our Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on May 8, 2025, which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. That Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements in Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors, in Part I of this Annual Report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters based upon past experience and management’s judgment that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in \nFinancial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAllowances for Credit Losses: \nOur receivables primarily consist of short-term trade accounts receivable from customers that result from the sale of goods and services. We also provide customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.\n43\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nThe Company considers historical credit losses, the current economic environment, customer credit ratings, collections on past due amounts, legal disputes, and bankruptcies, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop its allowance for credit losses. Management reviews these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed to the allowance. \nSales to the Company’s ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), accounted for approximately 72% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2025 and comprised approximately 48% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2025. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 24% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2025 and comprised approximately 23% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2025. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from GPOs or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nReserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business, and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2025 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed, as well as assessment of trends currently available.\nAt March 31, 2025, trade and notes receivables were $22.6 billion prior to allowances of $472 million. Our provision for bad debts was a credit of $130 million, in fiscal 2025 and a charge of $819 million, and $45 million in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2025 and 2024, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 2.1% and 4.5%, respectively. The provision for bad debts for fiscal 2024 included a charge of $725 million within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment related to the bankruptcy of our customer Rite Aid, as discussed in the \n“Trends and Uncertainties”\n section of this financial review and the \nFinancial Note 20, “Segments of Business,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. This amount represented the uncollected trade accounts receivable balance due from Rite Aid prior to its bankruptcy petition filing in October 2023. During the year ended March 31, 2025, we reassessed our initial estimates made in conjunction with the previously reserved prepetition balances, including cash received during the period, resulting in a reversal of $206 million recorded within “Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and included within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. During the year ended March 31, 2025, we released $237 million of allowance for doubtful accounts against trade accounts receivables, representing the write-off of uncollectible receivables related to the Rite Aid provision in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAn increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the fiscal 2025 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $23 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowances for credit losses may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report.\nInventories:\n Inventories consist of merchandise held for resale. We report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the LIFO method which are valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. The LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under LIFO approximates market. The majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method or weighted-average purchase prices. Rebates, cash discounts, and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. \nIn determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations, and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products, or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.\n44\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nAt March 31, 2025 and 2024, total inventories, net were $23.0 billion and $21.1 billion, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 63% and 62% of our inventories at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. If we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $309 million and $227 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We recognized a LIFO charge of $82 million in fiscal 2025, a LIFO credit of $157 million in fiscal 2024, and a LIFO charge of $1 million in fiscal 2023, all within “Cost of sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The LIFO charge in fiscal 2025 compared to a LIFO credit in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to higher brand inflation in the current fiscal year. The LIFO credit in fiscal 2024 compared to a LIFO charge in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower brand inflation, offset by higher brand inventory levels, lower deflation from off patent launch activity, and lower generics deflation. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. \nWe believe that the moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. \nBusiness Combinations: \nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, including contingent consideration, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that we obtain control of the acquired business. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.\nSeveral valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a variation of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset is discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 2\n, “\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our acquisitions. \nCertain business combinations involve the potential for future payments of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones or other agreed-upon events. The liability for the contingent consideration is measured at its fair value as of the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected operational and financial information, the probability of achievement of performance milestones or other agreed-upon events, and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to calculate the present value of the probability-weighted projected financial information\n.\n Contingent liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the liability is resolved with changes in fair value being recognized within “Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significant adjustment to the fair value.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets:\nGoodwill\nAs a result of acquiring businesses, we have $10.0 billion and $10.1 billion of goodwill at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \nWe perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the first fiscal quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. \nGoodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.\n45\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nWe apply the goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded equal to the amount of excess carrying value above the estimated fair value, if any, but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nTo estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the reasonableness of our concluded fair values.\nEstimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates, or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry, or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. Under the market approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline public companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit. Under the income approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the determination of discount rates. The discount rates represent the weighted-average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing, which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure. Included in the estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections.\nThe annual impairment testing performed for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill.\nRefer to \nFinancial \nNote 10\n, “\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\n,\n” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.\nLong-Lived Assets\nCurrently, all of our identifiable intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 30 years. We review intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of intangible and other long-lived assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and the remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.\nOur ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 3\n, “\nRestructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net\n,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our long-lived asset impairments.\n46\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nLong-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortized. Fair value is determined based on the total consideration expected to be received by the Company. The fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group. When the net realizable value of a disposal group increases during a period, a gain can be recognized to the extent that it does not increase the value of the disposal group beyond its original carrying value when the disposal group was reclassified as held for sale. \nRestructuring Charges: \nWe have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exit-related costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. We generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are expensed as incurred. In connection with these restructuring actions, we also assess the recoverability of long-lived assets used in the business, and as a result, we may recognize accelerated depreciation and amortization reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 3\n, “\nRestructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on restructuring matters. \nIncome Taxes: \nOur income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties, including those used to conclude on the unrecognized tax position related to opioid-related litigation and claims, and may differ from the actual amounts of tax benefit recognized. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.\nChanges in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. \nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations.\nWe recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 6\n, “\nIncome Taxes\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on income tax matters. \n47\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nLoss Contingencies: \nWe are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a material loss is reasonably possible, or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Legal fees are expensed as incurred when the legal services are provided.\nWe review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on future negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system, and other interested parties. \nIn conjunction with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party. For the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a charge of $149 million within “Claims and litigation charges, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations to reflect its portion of a proposed settlement with a nationwide class of acute care hospitals, and the corresponding liability was included within “Other accrued liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the year ended March 31, 2025, we recorded a charge of $114 million within “Claims and litigation charges, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations to reflect the Company’s portion of the settlement with representatives of a nationwide group of certain third-party payors, of which $57 million was recorded within Corporate expenses, net, and U.S. Pharmaceutical, respectively. The corresponding liability was included within “Other accrued liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At March 31, 2025, our estimated accrued liability for opioid-related claims was $6.4 billion. Because of the many uncertainties associated with the remaining opioid-related litigation matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible losses for all opioid-related litigation matters. We are not able to predict the outcome in these matters, and an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or liquidity. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 17\n, “\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.\n48\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities, commercial paper program, and other borrowings will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term capital expenditures, working capital, and other cash requirements. We remain adequately capitalized, including access to liquidity from our $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future.\nThe following table summarizes the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the periods shown:\nYears Ended March 31, \n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\nChange\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n6,085 \n$\n4,314 \n$\n1,771 \nInvesting activities\n(733)\n(1,072)\n339 \nFinancing activities\n(3,965)\n(3,342)\n(623)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(16)\n6 \n(22)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n1,371 \n$\n(94)\n$\n1,465 \nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided cash of $6.1 billion and $4.3 billion for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers, inventory receipts, and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements, and vendor payment terms.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.8 billion compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the following:\n•\nthe Company’s net income increased by $321 million and was favorably impacted by higher net non-cash items of $549 million, compared to the prior year period driven by factors discussed in more detail in the \n“Overview of Consolidated Results”\n section of this Financial Review, including an increase in cash receipts for our share of antitrust legal settlements of $200 million;\n•\nan increase in cash of $3.7 billion related to accounts payable as a result of customary vendor payment scheduling, and higher purchases to support business growth, partially offset by timing related to the day of the week on which the period ends;\n•\na decrease in net cash of $981 million related to accounts receivable primarily due to growth in specialty pharmaceuticals sales and higher volumes from retail national account customers in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment;\n•\na decrease in net cash of $976 million related to higher inventory purchases to support business growth; and\n•\na decrease in cash driven by higher income tax payments in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used cash of $733 million and $1.1 billion for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2025 includes $537 million and $322 million, respectively, in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2025 was also impacted by the receipt of proceeds of $189 million related to investments in equity securities, as discussed in \nFinancial Note 15, “Fair Value Measurements,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nInvesting activities for the year ended March 31, 2024 includes $431 million and $256 million, respectively,\n \nin capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, as well as $272 million of net cash payments for acquisitions.\n49\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities used cash of $4.0 billion and $3.3 billion for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2025 includes $3.1 billion of cash paid for share repurchases and $345 million of cash paid for dividends. Financing activities also includes cash receipts and cash payments of $15.1 billion related to short-term borrowings of commercial paper in fiscal 2025. On September 10, 2024, we completed a public offering of 4.25% Notes due September 15, 2029 in a principal amount of $500 million. Proceeds received from this note issuance, net of discounts and offering expenses, were $496 million. We utilized the net proceeds from this note issuance along with cash on hand to redeem our $500 million outstanding principal amount of 5.25% Notes due February 15, 2026 prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through the settlement date.\nFinancing activities for the year ended March 31, 2024 includes $3.0 billion of cash paid for share repurchases and $314 million of cash paid for dividends. Financing activities also includes cash receipts and cash payments of $20.0 billion related to short-term borrowings of commercial paper in fiscal 2024. \nOn June 15, 2023, we completed a public offering of 4.90% Notes due July 15, 2028 in a principal amount of $400 million and 5.10% Notes due July 15, 2033 in a principal amount of $600 million, for proceeds received, net of discounts and offering expenses, of $397 million and $592 million, respectively. A portion of the net proceeds from these notes was utilized to fund the repurchase of our then outstanding 3.80% Notes due March 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) discussed below, while the remaining net proceeds was available for general corporate purposes.\nOn June 16, 2023, we completed a cash tender offer for any and all of our then outstanding 2024 Notes with a principal amount of $918 million, which was made concurrently with the June 15, 2023 notes offering described above. Using a portion of the proceeds from the June 15, 2023 notes offering, we paid an aggregate consideration of $268 million to repurchase $271 million principal amount of the 2024 Notes. Following the consummation of this tender offer, on June 16, 2023, we irrevocably deposited U.S. government obligations with the trustee under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes sufficient to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest of the remaining $647 million principal amount of the 2024 Notes as it became due, and of the principal amount of those 2024 Notes on their March 15, 2024 maturity date.\nCash used for other financing activities generally includes shares surrendered for tax withholding and payments to noncontrolling interests.\nShare Repurchase Plans\nThe Board has authorized the repurchase of common stock. We may repurchase common stock from time-to-time through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, or by combinations of such methods, any of which may use pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, tax implications, restrictions under our debt obligations, other uses for capital, impacts on the value of remaining shares, cash generated from operations, and market and economic conditions.\nEffective January 1, 2023, our repurchase of common stock, adjusted for allowable items, are subject to a 1% excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Excise taxes incurred on share repurchases of an entity’s own common stock are direct and incremental costs to purchase treasury stock, and accordingly are included in the total cost basis of the common stock acquired and reflected as a reduction of stockholders’ equity within “Treasury shares” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Deficit. Excise taxes do not reduce our remaining authorization for the repurchase of common stock. Excise taxes of $26 million and $25 million were accrued for shares repurchased during the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. On October 30, 2024, we made a payment of $25 million for fiscal 2024 excise taxes previously accrued. As of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the amount accrued for excise taxes was $26 million, and $25 million, respectively, within “Other accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n50\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nInformation regarding the share repurchase activity over the last two fiscal years was as follows:\nShare Repurchases \n(1)\n(In millions, except price per share)\nTotal \nNumber of\nShares \nPurchased \n(2) \nAverage Price \nPaid Per Share\nApproximate \nDollar Value of \nShares that May \nYet Be Purchased \nUnder the \nPrograms \n(3) (4)\nBalance, March 31, 2023\n$\n3,613 \nShare repurchase authorization increase in fiscal 2024 \n6,000 \nShares repurchased - Open market\n6.9 \n$\n436.46 \n(2,998)\nBalance, March 31, 2024\n6,615 \nShare repurchase authorization increase in fiscal 2025\n4,000 \nShares repurchased - Open market\n5.8 \n$\n543.05 \n(3,146)\nBalance, March 31, 2025\n$\n7,469 \n(1)\nThis table does not include the value of equity awards surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations or forfeitures of equity awards.\n(2)\nThe number of shares purchased reflects rounding adjustments.\n(3)\nThe remaining authorization outstanding for repurchases of common stock excludes $26 million and $25 million of excise taxes incurred on share repurchases for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(4)\nIn July 2023 and July 2024, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $6.0 billion and $4.0 billion shares of common stock, respectively, both of which have no expiration date.\nSelected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nMarch 31, \n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n5,956 \n$\n4,585 \nWorking capital\n(6,206)\n(4,387)\nDays sales outstanding for: \n(1)\nCustomer receivables\n22 \n22 \nInventories\n24 \n26 \nDrafts and accounts payable\n57 \n58 \nDebt to capital ratio \n(2)\n125.3 \n%\n124.0 \n%\n(1)\nBased on year-end balances and sales or cost of sales for the last 90 days of the year.\n(2)\nThis ratio describes the relationship and changes within our capital resources, and is computed as the sum of total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ deficit, which excludes noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nCash equivalents, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA-rated U.S. government money market funds, short-term deposits with financial institutions, and short-term commercial papers issued by non-financial institutions. Deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Canadian dollars. Deposits could exceed the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the U.S. and similar deposit insurance programs in other jurisdictions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMD&A Index\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2025 and 2024 included approximately $2.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Although the majority of cash held outside the U.S. is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. We may remit foreign earnings to the U.S. to the extent it is tax efficient to do so. We do not anticipate the tax impact from remitting these earnings to be material. Following enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the repatriation of cash to the U.S. is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes.\nWorking capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, and prepaid expenses, net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, current portion of operating lease liabilities, and other accrued liabilities. Our businesses require substantial investments in working capital that are susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements.\nConsolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable from increased purchasing driven by increased sales and timing, and an increase in the current portion of long-term debt. These were partially offset by an increase in receivables, net and inventories, net, driven by higher sales and timing, an increase in cash and cash equivalents, and a decrease in other accrued liabilities.\nOur debt to capital ratio increased for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year primarily due to share repurchases and dividend payments as well as repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by net income attributable to McKesson for the year and issuance of new long-term debt.\nIn July 2024, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.62 to $0.71 per share of common stock for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were $2.75 per share in fiscal 2025 and $2.40 per share in fiscal 2024, and we paid total cash dividends of $345 million and $314 million in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, and other factors.\nMaterial Cash Requirements: \nThe table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments as of\n \nMarch 31, 2025:\nYears\n(In millions)\nTotal\nWithin 1\nOver 1 to 3\nOver 3 to 5\nAfter 5\nOn balance sheet\nTotal debt\n (1)\n$\n5,654 \n$\n1,184 \n$\n1,612 \n$\n1,736 \n$\n1,122 \nOperating lease obligations\n (2) \n2,078 \n313 \n565 \n423 \n777 \nOther\n (3) \n72 \n18 \n10 \n22 \n22 \nOff balance sheet\nInterest on borrowings\n (4)\n1,240 \n179 \n330 \n245 \n486 \nPurchase obligations\n (5)\n8,823 \n8,804 \n11 \n7 \n1 \nOther \n(6)\n395 \n111 \n240 \n9 \n35 \nTotal\n$\n18,262 \n$\n10,609 \n$\n2,768 \n$\n2,442 \n$\n2,443 \n(1)\nRepresents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations, including finance lease obligations.

Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 16\n, “\nFinancial Guarantees and Warranties\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information. \nThe material cash requirements table above excludes the following obligations:\nAt March 31, 2025, the Company had accrued liabilities of $6.4 billion related to the settlement of opioid-related litigation claims with U.S. governmental entities, including Native American tribes, and certain non-governmental plaintiffs as described in \nFinancial \nNote 17\n, “\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The majority of this amount relates to governmental entities opioid settlement payable in annual installments through 2038 pursuant to the schedule set forth in the agreement. As of March 31, 2025, $776 million is estimated to be paid within the next twelve months.\nAt March 31, 2025, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $1.1 billion. The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. Refer to \nFinancial \nNote 6\n, “\nIncome Taxes\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on income tax matters.\nAt March 31, 2025, our banks and insurance companies have issued $206 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, pension obligations in Europe, and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.\nCapital Resources\nWe fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from short-term borrowings from our commercial paper issuances, and longer-term credit agreements and debt offerings. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements, including any future payments that may be made related to our total estimated litigation liability of $6.4 billion as of March 31, 2025 payable under the terms of various settlement agreements for opioid-related claims, are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources, and future borrowings. Long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, are open and accessible to us should we decide to access those markets. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in \nFinancial Note 11, “Debt and Financing Activities,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nWe believe that our future operating cash flow, financial assets, and access to capital and credit markets, including our credit facilities, give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that an increase in volatility or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.\nRELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS \nInformation regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in \nFinancial \nNote 19\n, “\nRelated Party Balances and Transactions\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. \nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in \nFinancial \nNote 1\n, “\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n,”\n to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\n53\nTable of Contents\nMcKESSON CORPORATION",
