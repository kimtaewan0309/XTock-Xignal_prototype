The following sets forth our estimates for the size of our principal markets:\n•\nOutsourced research and development: \nBiopharmaceutical spending on drug development totaled approximately $194 billion in 2024. Of that amount, we estimate that our addressable opportunity (clinical development spending excluding preclinical spending) was approximately $155 billion. The portion of this addressable opportunity that was outsourced in 2024, based on our estimates, was approximately $73 billion.\n•\nReal-World Evidence and connected health: \nTotal addressable market of approximately $85 billion in 2024 that consists of tightly coupled life sciences and healthcare markets. First, the life sciences market for Real-World Evidence of approximately $30 billion includes post-launch evidence generation, market access, and medical affairs. Second, the addressable opportunity for connected healthcare is approximately $55 billion, and includes areas such as revenue cycle management, payer & provider analytics and clinical decision support services.\n•\nTechnology enabled commercial operations: \nTotal addressable market of approximately $82 billion in 2024 that includes information, data warehousing, IT outsourcing, software applications and other services in the broader market for IT services. This addressable opportunity also includes commercial services such as recruiting, training, deploying and managing global sales forces, channel management, patient engagement services, market access consulting, brand communication, advisory services, and health information analytics and technology consulting.\nIn deriving estimates of the size of the various markets described above, we review third-party sources, which include estimates and forecasts of spending in various segments, in combination with internal IQVIA research and analysis informed by our experience serving these segments, as well as projected growth rates for each of these segments. See “Industry and Market Data” above.\nWe believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development services, technology & analytics solutions and contract sales and medical solutions:\nGrowth and innovation in the life sciences industry. \nThe life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system and, according to the latest information available from the IQVIA Market Prognosis service, is estimated to have generated approximately $1.73 trillion in revenues in 2024. According to the IQVIA Institute, it is estimated that spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets will expand at a 5% to 8% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) through 2029. The growth of emerging markets demonstrates their strategic importance to global life sciences organizations along with the emergence of local and regional companies with similar operational and informational needs. We expect all of these organizations to apply a high degree of sophistication to their commercial operations in these countries, especially as some begin to emerge as sources of original innovative products. For global companies, this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets, the development of market access strategies and performance benchmarking. In addition, local players are learning that they need to compete on the basis of improved information and analytics.\n6\nGrowth in Research and Development. \nSpending trends in research and development are impacted as a result of several factors, including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost from the so-called “patent cliff,” increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry, and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities. The IQVIA Institute also estimates that approximately 350 new molecular entities (“NMEs”) are expected to be approved between 2025 and 2029, or 70 per year compared to 61 per year on average during the past decade. We believe that further research and development spending, combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape, will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies, particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings, to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre- and post-launch solutions development and commercialization needs. The impact of recent legislative changes on product launch and industry innovation continues to be evaluated. IQVIA is involved with many stakeholders throughout the industry as we help navigate changes over the coming decade.\nIncreased Complexity in Research and Development. \nBiopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate. Improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies, such as biologics, genetically targeted therapies, gene and stem cell therapies, and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways. We believe that our global clinical development capabilities, including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network, position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important. For example, IQVIA Connected Intelligence helps us validate protocols to ensure studies in new disease areas have greater accuracy and also enables us, through innovations such as predictive analytics, to find patients who may not have been diagnosed.\nRegulators require clinical trials to involve local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products, especially in certain Asian and emerging markets. Understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies, both for multinational and local/regional biopharmaceutical companies. We believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in Asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development.\nFinancial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency. \nDespite expected accelerating growth in the global life sciences market, we believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due to their changing product mix, pricing and reimbursement challenges, and rising costs of compliance. Product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines. We believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency. Further, our clients are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation, consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloud-based applications. This provides opportunities for technology services vendors to capture and consolidate the internal spending of life sciences companies by providing lower-cost and variable-cost options that lower clients’ research and development, selling, marketing and administrative costs.\nEvolving need to integrate and structure expanding sources of data. \nOver the past decade, many health systems around the world have focused on digitizing medical records. While such records theoretically enhance access to data, relevant information is often unintegrated, unstructured, siloed in disparate software systems, or entered inconsistently. In addition, new sources of data from the internet, such as social media and information on limited patient pools, and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic technologies are creating new sources of healthcare data.\nIn order to derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources of information, clients need access to statistically significant data sets organized into databases that can be queried and analyzed. For example, real-world evidence studies demonstrate practical and clinical effectiveness, which can require the aggregation and integration of large clinical data sets across multiple care settings, types of therapies and patient cohorts. Longitudinal studies require analysis of non-identified patient diagnoses, treatments, procedures and laboratory test results to identify types of patients that will likely best respond to particular therapies. Finally, manufacturers also can require the ability to analyze social media activity to identify unmet patient needs and support for new orphan drugs. This information is highly relevant to all healthcare stakeholders and we believe the opportunity to more broadly apply healthcare data can only be realized through structuring, organizing and integrating new and existing forms of data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics.\n7\nNeed for demonstrated value in healthcare. \nParticipants in the healthcare industry are focused on improving quality and reducing costs, both of which require assessment of quality and value of therapies and providers. As a result, physicians no longer make prescribing decisions in isolation, but rather in the context of guidance and rules from payers, integrated delivery networks and governments. We believe life sciences companies are working to bring alignment across constituents on the value of their treatments in order to successfully develop and commercialize new therapies and improve lives of patients.\nThere is increasing pressure on life sciences companies to support and justify the value of their therapies. Many new drugs that are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny by regulators and payers to determine whether the existing treatment options would be sufficient. Additionally, many new specialty drugs are molecular-based therapies and require a more detailed understanding of clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value. As a result, leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services.\nWe believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these global trends in healthcare. Beyond our proprietary information assets, we have developed key capabilities to assess opportunities to develop and commercialize therapies, support and defend the value of medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application of our clinical, scientific and operational knowledge as well as our insight-driven decision-making and cost-efficient technology solutions.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe believe we are well positioned for continued growth across the markets we serve. Our strategy for achieving growth includes:\nContinue to innovate through our IQVIA Connected Intelligence by leveraging our information, advanced analytics, transformative technology and significant domain expertise. \nAs a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies, we can empower our therapeutic, scientific and domain experts with expansive levels of information including product level tracking in 95 markets and information about treatments and outcomes on more than 1.2 billion unique non-identified patient records. By connecting this intelligence, we have the ability to optimize the clinical trial process and enable our clients to reduce costs and get their products to market more quickly through more informed site selection, faster patient recruitment practices and decentralized trials. We transform Real World Evidence by linking prospective and retrospective approaches and introduce innovation such as secondary control arms, which can eliminate the need for a placebo group. We bring best in class Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") platforms, purpose built for life sciences, to our clients to help them run their clinical and commercial operations more efficiently.\nBuild upon our extensive client relationships and leverage our global presence\n. \nWe have a diversified base of over 10,000 clients in over \n100\n countries and have expanded our client value proposition to address a broader market for research and development and commercial operations which we estimate to be approximately $330 billion in 2024. Through the combined offerings of research and development and commercial services we built a platform that allows us to be a more complete partner to our clients.\nExpand the penetration of our offerings to the broader healthcare marketplace. \nWe believe that substantial opportunities exist to use our existing technology and domain expertise to serve additional healthcare stakeholders (payers, providers, healthcare professionals, governments, non-governmental organizations) to quantify and optimize cost of care delivery; provide registry technology to professional association and patient communities and support healthcare providers with system implementation and platform migration.\nExpand portfolio through strategic acquisitions. \nWe have and expect to continue to acquire assets and businesses that strengthen our value proposition to clients. We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for stockholders. As the global healthcare landscape evolves, we expect that there will be a growing number of acquisition opportunities across the life sciences, payer and provider sectors. We expect to continue to invest in or explore opportunities for strategic acquisitions to grow our platform and enhance our ability to provide more services to our clients.\nOur Offerings\nWe offer hundreds of distinct services, applications, technology platforms and solutions to help our clients make critical decisions and perform better.

Information in the 2024 Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To facilitate the disclosure of comparable, consistent, and reliable sustainability information, the 2024 Sustainability Report will be aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\") and the Global Reporting Initiative (\"GRI\") reporting frameworks by including therein and reporting against their respective reporting standards indexes. The 2024 Sustainability Report also discusses our risks and opportunities related to environmental events and natural disasters in accordance with the recommended disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\"). \nGovernment Regulation\nMany aspects of our businesses are regulated by federal and state laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, we maintain a robust compliance program aimed at ensuring we operate our business in compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses. There are, however, occasionally uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, fines or other sanctions. See Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors” for additional detail.\nGood Clinical Practice\nGood Clinical Practice (“GCP”) regulations and guidelines are the industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to maintaining the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects. The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and most other global regulatory authorities expect that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with GCP provisions. Records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the FDA and other regulators.\n11\nRegulation of Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products. Failure to comply with applicable United States requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending new drug application (NDA) for a new drug, a biologics license application (BLA) for a new biological product, pre-market approval (PMA) or clearance for a new medical device, warning or untitled letters, clinical holds, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.\nRegulation of Patient Information\nOur information management services relate to the processing of information regarding patient diagnosis and treatment of disease and are, therefore, subject to substantial governmental regulation. In addition, the confidentiality of patient-specific information and the circumstances under which such patient-specific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated. Federal, state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession, use and dissemination of personal data, such as personal health information and personal financial data, as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement additional security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation de-identified health or other data, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services.\nIn particular, personal health information is recognized in many countries or regions such as the United States, the European Union (EU), Latin America, Asia and others, as a special, sensitive category of personal information, subject to additional mandatory protections. Violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties, civil money penalties and criminal prosecution, including corporate fines and personal liability.\nRegulation of Promotion, Marketing and Distribution of Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices\nCertain of our services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate. Such regulation relates, among other things, to the distribution of drug samples, the marketing and promotion of approved products, the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions.\nIn the United States, certain of our services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices. Certain of our services are subject to the FDA’s regulations against “off-label promotion,” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act imposes licensing, personnel record keeping, packaging, labeling, product handling and facility storage and security requirements. Other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers, suppliers and providers from offering, giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services. The sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the United States Federal Trade Commission Act and state consumer protection laws. We are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer Contract Sales & Medical Solutions.\nWe are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices, including, among others, various aspects of Medicare and federal healthcare programs. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal and/or civil penalties, including possibly as an “aider and abettor.”\n12\nRegulation of Laboratories\nOur United States laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, and the safety and health of laboratory employees. Additionally, our United States laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, radioactive materials and laboratory specimens, including the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Transportation, the National Fire Protection Agency and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the United States by the DEA and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world. Our United States laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the DEA. The regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Public Health Service and Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. Our laboratories also are subject to International Air Transport Association regulations, which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens. Furthermore, when the materials are sent to a foreign country, the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws, rules and regulations of such foreign country. Our laboratories outside the United States are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing, the handling and disposal of medical specimens, genetic material, hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees.\nIn addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.\nFurther, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”), as well as requirements established by various states. The failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the CLIA certification.\nData Privacy\nPatient health information is among the most sensitive of personal information, and it is critically important that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access, use and disclosure. Real world evidence -- information that allows us to examine actual practices and outcomes -- is essential to increase access to care, improve outcomes, and lower costs. IQVIA uses a wide variety of privacy-enhancing technologies and safeguards to protect individual privacy while generating and analyzing information on a scale that helps healthcare stakeholders identify disease patterns and correlate with the precise treatment path and therapy needed for better outcomes. We employ a wide variety of methods to manage privacy requirements, including:\n•\ngovernance, frameworks, models and training to promote good decision making and accountability;\n•\na layered approach to privacy and security management to avoid a single point of failure;\n•\nongoing evaluation of privacy and security practices to promote continuous improvement;\n•\nuse of technical, administrative, physical and organizational safeguards and controls;\n•\ncollaboration with data suppliers and trusted third parties for our syndicated market research and analytics offerings to remove identifiable information or employ effective encryption or other techniques to render information non-identified before data is delivered to us; and\n•\nwork with leading researchers, policy makers, thought leaders and others in a variety of fields relevant to the application of effective privacy and security practices, including statistical, epidemiological and cryptographic sciences, legal, information security and compliance, and privacy.\nWe are an industry leader in de-identifying data. Our capabilities allow us to render data non-identified while still maintaining data utility, thus protecting privacy while still advancing innovation. Not only do we make use of de-identification techniques with respect to the data we hold, but we also share our expertise in this area with policymakers, regulators and others to help them understand de-identification methodologies and practical considerations to avoid re-identification risk.\nWe operate in more than \n100\n countries around the world, many of which have data protection and privacy laws and regulations based on similar core principles (e.g., openness, accountability, security safeguards, etc.). We apply those principles globally and augment our practices to address local laws, contractual obligations and other data privacy requirements.\n13\nOur Global Privacy team, led by our Global Chief Privacy Officer, is comprised of privacy professionals and privacy law experts who drive our strategy and develop and manage our policies and standards. The Global Privacy team provides subject matter expertise related to the proper management of all data types. In addition, our Global Privacy team liaises with our Legal, IT, Information Security and other teams so that privacy requirements are addressed in technology development, contracting, offerings and other business activities.\nThe IQVIA Privacy Policy (the \"Privacy Policy\") is our foundational privacy policy. It explains how, when applicable, we collect, hold, use and disclose personal information, including that of our personnel, consumers, healthcare professionals, patients, medical research subjects, clinical investigators, customers, suppliers, vendors, business partners and investors. You can find the Privacy Policy on our website at https://www.iqvia.com/about-us/privacy/privacy-policy. Information in the Privacy Policy is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Intellectual Property\nIn addition to our proprietary data sets described above, we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of legal, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We consider our trademark and related names, marks and logos to be of material importance to our business, and we have registered or applied for registration for certain of these trademarks, including IQVIA, in the United States and other jurisdictions and aggressively seek to protect them. Trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. The technology and other intellectual property rights owned and licensed by us are of importance to our business, although our management believes that our business, as a whole, is not dependent upon any one intellectual property or group of such properties.\nArtificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence (\"AI\") presents opportunities for smarter healthcare. It can enable the industry to better understand patient needs, identify new approaches to treatment, and scale and democratize access to medicine. IQVIA has a rich history of developing Healthcare-grade AI™. We have steadily expanded our capabilities over the years in connection with machine learning, natural language processing and generative AI as technology evolves. For example, AI can be used to generate new insights and recommendations, helping to increase clinical trials efficiency at all stages from trial design to data submission. \nWe use AI to deliver tangible customer benefits and patient impact, while focusing on ethical application, responsible use and compliance with emerging regulation. The expanded use of AI is generating clear benefits, but also concerns about data security, privacy and trust. IQVIA is committed to implementing technology in a way that addresses these concerns. Our new Center for Defensible Data and AI and our AI Governance Council support employee compliance with our guiding principles of Defensible AI, Trustworthy AI, and Responsible and Ethical AI. This helps us to maintain high standards across the business and ensures we are well-placed to comply with emerging regulation such as the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (the \"EU AI Act\") and the Colorado AI Act.\nGiven the sensitive and complex nature of health-related information, developing and implementing AI for healthcare requires additional safeguards, including privacy standards and regulatory compliance. IQVIA Healthcare-grade AI™ is embedded across our AI-powered offerings, engineered to meet the level of precision, speed, and trust needed by the industry. It combines IQVIA's expertise across life sciences, data science, information management, and technology with AI models trained on our extensive, high quality, and diverse health data. Our ability to connect these powerful capabilities enables us to responsibly advance AI in healthcare and accelerate the delivery of solutions to improve patients’ lives.\nIQVIA employs a wide variety of policies, procedures, guidelines, training, communications, tools and other resources to support the responsible use of AI technologies, including generative AI, to use AI responsibly and comply with legislation such as the EU AI Act, including:\n•\nFor higher risk AI activities, we have established procedures and methodologies to evaluate or test input, AI models, output and other aspects of AI use for error, bias, hallucinations and results that are not otherwise fit for the intended purpose.\n14\n•\nFor lower risk activities, a variety of policies, standard operating procedures, guidance and training support our employees in the use of AI models — for example, the use of AI assistants to improve employee communications, and ensuring we have the necessary rights to use any non-IQVIA content with AI tools.\n•\nWe have established private instances of certain public large language models. This ensures proprietary IQVIA content is not used to train public models and that the output and AI models derived from the use of proprietary content remains subject to IQVIA requirements and guidelines.\n•\nRobust AI policies and practices must be built on a solid foundation of good information governance policies and practices relating to data privacy, information security, intellectual property management, contract compliance, vendor management and related domains. IQVIA has extensive policies and practices addressing these topics, and substantial resources and experience in each of these domains.\n•\nGood AI policies and practices also depend upon strong supporting policies, practices and experience relating to the design, development, testing, implementation, management and support of technology. IQVIA has extensive policies and practices addressing these topics, and substantial resources and experience relating to the responsible use of technology.\n•\nIQVIA employs an information security framework based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\"), Health Information Trust Alliance (\"HITRUST\") and other common standards to define the minimum security controls and safeguards that are appropriate for each type of content.\nHuman Capital \nOverview. \nOur approximately \n88,000\n employees drive our vision to power smarter healthcare for everyone, everywhere. They are comprised of specialists across multiple disciplines, including medical and life sciences, engineering, technology, data science and more. Investments in our people are aimed at attracting, developing, and retaining a talented workforce. These efforts not only engage our people but also result in strong productivity and superior outcomes for our clients.\nWe unite our global workforce through our Employee Value Proposition (EVP), which consists of four values that make up our identity – passion, collaboration, innovation, and growth. The nature of our business attracts IQVIANs who thrive by innovating and growing together while they do meaningful work that helps people lead healthier lives. \n We offer curated upskilling pathways and project opportunities across our businesses, empowering employees to build the skills for tomorrow while following their passions. We encourage IQVIANs to pursue multiple careers here, including unconventional career paths that bring new ways of thinking. This commitment fosters their professional development and, in an industry as competitive as ours, contributes to our favorable attrition and internal movement.\nBoard Oversight of Human Capital Management. \nOur Board of Directors (our \"Board\") receives periodic updates on key human capital metrics, including recruitment and attrition rates, talent development data, and statistics related to our overall workforce.\nOur Board also devotes significant time to leadership development and succession planning at the executive level and provides guidance on important decisions in each of these areas. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board has primary responsibility for succession planning for the chief executive officer and oversight of succession planning for senior leadership.\nHuman Capital Management Strategy.\n Our employees are essential to our continued success and are a core element of our long-term strategy, especially as demand for critical skills continues to grow. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that our initiatives, policies, and processes reflect and reinforce our desired corporate culture, which we believe supports the development of the people and skills we will need tomorrow. Our human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\n•\nRecruitment\n. We consider a range of qualified candidates for all positions. We hire qualified individuals with a variety of backgrounds and experiences from both within and outside the organization for positions at all levels.\n•\nDevelopment & Progression.\n We are committed to having a broad pipeline of talent moving through our organization and providing opportunities for all employees to develop within their current role as well as towards their next role. We do this by promoting our One IQVIA, Multiple Careers approach, which helps employees build their skills using our curated learning content and uses technology to match employees to open roles and projects.\n15\n•\nRetention.\n We seek to develop a working environment where employees feel engaged and supported, wanting to stay and grow with us. Our retention efforts focus on areas that are important to our employees, including community, career, health & well-being, and financial rewards.\nEmployee Engagement. \nMaintaining regular and open channels of dialogue with employees and receiving and responding to their feedback with actionable and meaningful initiatives is critical to our human capital management strategy. Our bi-annual companywide surveys provide a valuable opportunity to hear the perspectives of our workforce around the world. \nWe heard from 71,000 employees on average across our two surveys in 2024, equivalent to an average 84% response rate. The employee engagement index has been stable across our surveys in 2024 with 79% of our employees who responded saying they feel engaged. 89% of employees who responded feel they are acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary to be effective in their roles, 7 points above the Fortune 500 Benchmark, with 9,700 employees participating in IQVIA’s Generative AI Masterclass Series. 83% of employees who responded see a clear link between their work and IQVIA’s vision, 2 points above the Fortune 500 Benchmark. 70% of employees who responded believe IQVIA encourages an environment where they can challenge the status quo, surpassing the Fortune 500 Benchmark by 3 points. \nBuilding Community. \nThe scale and geographic reach of our business is a key asset that we leverage as we focus on building a connected community that celebrates both individual and cultural differences. This is a foundation of our approach to human capital management. We create this culture for employees regardless of gender, race, color, creed, religion, marital status, age, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, veteran status, citizenship, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other protected group status. \nOur global workforce operates in over \n100\n countries and represents approximately 90 different ethnicities. Approximately 62% of our employees globally identify as female and approximately 53% of employees worldwide at a manager level identify as female. In the United States, approximately 39% identify as a minority, including 16% who identify as Asian, 12% who identify as Black or African American, 8% who identify as Hispanic or Latino and 3% who identify as a different minority. \nOur growing network of Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\") provides a framework for employees to connect and collaborate with colleagues with similar interests. These groups support our values and business goals and foster the multifaceted thinking required for innovation, providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and opportunities for mentoring and professional development. These groups also organize activities to engage and educate our wider employee community on different perspectives and experiences. There are eight global ERGs and all are employee-led, voluntary, and open to every employee. Each ERG has a mission that is aligned to our vision, values, and core operating principles. In 2024, we grew our ERG membership to 13,000 participants spanning 69 countries across the globe.\nOur second 2024 Employee Pulse Survey included a focus on belonging to enable us to understand employee needs in this area and align our approach to help employees do their best work. According to respondents, the most important elements of belonging include opportunities to learn and grow; working in a supportive team environment; and being involved in meaningful work. The most-selected actions that foster employees’ sense of belonging were regular manager feedback, formal and informal recognition for their contributions, and learning/development activities. These insights are being incorporated into our plans to further reinforce our strengths and drive meaningful updates.\nEmployee Health & Well-being.\n Investing in resources and incentives to promote the personal well-being of our employees and their families is an important way we support our people. \nWe provide a variety of market-competitive health and welfare benefit plans that are available to employees and their family members, based on their location and specific country regulations. Plans may include medical, dental, and vision coverage; telemedicine and on-site medical care; critical illness coverage; disability, accidental death and dismemberment, pet and life insurance; tuition reimbursement; identity theft protection; commuter benefits; matching gift programs; and locally relevant savings and retirement plans such as pensions.\nWe provide parental leave for all full-time employees for the birth or adoption of a child, with variability in leave time dependent on location. We also provide paid leave for other life matters including sick time, bereavement, jury duty, military service, and time off for voting, depending on country specific policies.\n16\nBeyond health and welfare benefits, many regions also offer employee well-being programs. “Healthy You” is our global program focusing on building a healthy work environment where employees thrive and can maximize their potential, improving health outcomes for all. The program focuses on five pillars: work, finances, connections, minds and bodies. In the United States, “Healthy You” offers employees a range of wellness benefits, including free flu shots, teledoc services, nutrition counseling, tobacco cessation support and reimbursement for wellness-related expenses. \nOur local Employee Assistance Programs (\"EAPs\") are available to our workforce worldwide. EAPs offer counseling services, alongside accessible training and webinars focused on a variety of everyday topics including financial planning, nutrition, social connections, stress management, time management and work-life balance. While benefits vary depending on location and local regulations, in all cases we aim to support the physical, mental, social, and financial well-being of employees and their families.\nFinancial Rewards. \nIQVIA compensation programs support our overall strategy by linking employee compensation with both business and personal performance. This approach to compensation demonstrates our “pay for performance” philosophy, as well as our focus on providing compensation programs that attract, retain, motivate and reward employees. In addition to the benefits described above, our compensation programs include base salaries, annual bonuses, and long-term incentive awards.\nTalent & Learning. \nIn a highly competitive industry, nurturing talent is both a priority and a necessity. Employee growth and development are key components of our Employee Value Proposition and our human capital management strategy. We foster a culture of curiosity and flexibility, encouraging our employees to explore different career opportunities within the organization. By taking ownership of their development in collaboration with managers, mentors, and peers, our employees are empowered to shape their career paths and achieve their full potential. \nWe invest in our employees' development throughout their careers at IQVIA, with a range of talent and learning initiatives that leverage cutting-edge digital tools to support business growth and meet the evolving needs of our employees. Our performance management system is aligned to this journey, emphasizing continuous dialogue about priorities, contributions, and personal growth – ensuring that employees feel supported, valued and recognized.\nWe are committed to building an environment where our employees have opportunities to learn, grow and shape their careers according to their aspirations and interests. Through our One IQVIA Multiple Careers model, we offer an extensive range of technology-enabled tools and resources from onboarding through to leadership training, enabling our people to plan their own career paths. Our continually expanding Career Connections platform provides 37,000 registered users access to mentoring, projects, and open roles to further develop skills in a practical setting and pursue their next role when ready. \nOur learning and development offerings allow our employees to put the One IQVIA, Multiple Careers Model into action. For example, our IQVIA Learning Academy informs employees about in-demand skills within IQVIA, providing transparency about the talent and expertise needed to meet future growth objectives. In 2024, employees continued building future skills through 215,000 visits to the IQVIA Learning Academy, with new learning paths aligned to business needs spanning artificial intelligence, evolving leadership, and data insights, amongst others.\nLearning at IQVIA is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Our offerings span business simulations, peer coaching, skills assessments, business projects, on-demand courses, short videos, live trainings, and quick reads. We also continually explore how technology can enhance our training offerings, making AI-based training another key focus area. For example, we used AI to develop a simulation of a fictional Alzheimer’s disease clinical trial where learners can practice the key skills needed to be a Clinical Research Associate. In the Asia Pacific region, our 2024 AI employee program included training, a hackathon, and use-case-sharing — enabling participants to build confidence in using AI tools in their work.\nWe maintain a focus on building the strong leadership pipeline we need to ensure our long-term success, offering differentiated programs tailored to different levels and goals. In 2024, over 1,099 employees from 48 countries participated in our enterprise leadership programs for key talent. Several examples include: \n•\nGlobal Leadership Development Program:\n Designed to build the next generation of global leaders by developing their business acumen, strategy, and people leadership skills. \n•\nLeader of the Future Portal (LOFT): \nContinues to help our managers shift their mindsets to successfully lead high-performing teams in a hybrid work environment.\n17\n•\nGeneral Management Acceleration Program:\n Piloted in 2024 in the U.S. and EMEA region, we created a program for future leaders within the Research and Development Solutions (R&DS) business to build our pipeline of individuals ready to fill a range of senior R&DS leadership roles. Expansion to the Asia Pacific region is planned for 2025.\nHealth and Safety. \nWe are committed to maintaining a safe workplace that supports and promotes our employees’ health. We adopt a safety-first mindset and continually look for ways to strengthen our procedures and practice, striving for safety excellence.\nWe incorporate environmental laws and regulations into our policies and procedures throughout our organization. At the corporate level, we have group certifications to ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018. In accordance with both certifications, we have a robust, integrated Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (\"EHSMS\") with supporting standard operating procedures in place, which demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement. Under our EHSMS, all employees must actively participate in helping to maintain a safe, healthy, and secure work environment. Our Code of Conduct describes the obligations of employees to maintain such an environment, follow all applicable safety and security rules and complete required training. \nIQVIA operates laboratories in the Americas, Asia, Europe, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Certain IQVIA laboratories are certified to ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018. Depending on the location and services provided accreditation also will include ANVISA, CAP ISO 15189, CDC Lipids, CLIA, ISO 9001, MOH Certified Laboratory, and NSGP Level 1.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is \nwww.iqvia.com\n, and our investor relations website is located at \nhttp://ir.iqvia.com\n.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n49\nOverview\nIQVIA is a leading global provider of clinical research services, commercial insights and healthcare intelligence to the life sciences and healthcare industries. IQVIA’s portfolio of solutions are powered by IQVIA Connected Intelligence™ to deliver actionable insights and services built on high-quality health data, Healthcare-grade AI™, advanced analytics, the latest technologies and extensive domain expertise. We are committed to using AI responsibly, ensuring that our AI-powered capabilities are grounded in privacy, regulatory compliance, and patient safety. With approximately 88,000 employees in over 100 countries, including experts in healthcare, life sciences, data science, technology and operational excellence, IQVIA is dedicated to accelerating the development and commercialization of innovative medical treatments to help improve patient outcomes and population health worldwide. \nWe are managed through three reportable segments: Technology & Analytics Solutions, Research & Development Solutions and Contract Sales & Medical Solutions. Technology & Analytics Solutions provides mission critical information, technology solutions and real world insights and services to our life science clients. Research & Development Solutions, which primarily serves biopharmaceutical clients, provides outsourced clinical research and clinical trial services. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions provides health care provider (including contract sales) and patient engagement services to both biopharmaceutical clients and the broader healthcare market.\nFor a description of our service offerings within our segments, refer to Part I, Item 1, “Business.”\nWe delivered another year of strong operating results in 2024 with our income from operations increasing over 11 percent and our cash flow from operating activities increasing over 26 percent from 2023. Our Technology & Analytics Solutions segment revenues and profit growth improved in the second half of the year as we captured opportunities relating to our clients increasing their spending. Our Research & Development Solutions segment also produced revenues and segment profit growth in 2024. Although we faced some challenges in our Research & Development Solutions segment in the latter half of 2024, and while we anticipate some of these challenges will persist into 2025, we consider these to be more short-term in nature. This segment overall is a long-cycle business. \nWe ended the year with our highest ever total company remaining performance obligations of approximately $33.5 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nWhile we experienced a decline in COVID-19 related work in 2024 versus 2023, overall COVID-19 related work was not material to operations. As of December 31, 2024, COVID-19 related work did not represent a material amount of our remaining performance obligations. \nWe continue to maintain strong liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $1,702 million and we had $825 million drawn under our $2,000 million revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our debt agreements in all material respects and do not have material uncertainty about ongoing ability to meet the covenants of our credit arrangements.\nIndustry Outlook\nFor information about the industry outlook and markets that we operate in, refer to Part I, Item I, “Our Market Opportunity.”\nBusiness Combinations\nWe have completed and will continue to consider strategic business combinations to enhance our capabilities and offerings in certain areas, including various individually immaterial acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. These transactions were accounted for as business combinations and the acquired results of operations are included in our consolidated financial information since their respective closing dates. See Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to these business combinations.\nSources of Revenues\nTotal revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services. We do not have any material product revenues.\n50\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our cost of revenues including reimbursed expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of revenues includes compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production, trial monitoring, data management and delivery, and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings; costs of staff directly involved with delivering technology-related services offerings and engagements, related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements; and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees, laboratory supplies, professional services and travel expenses. Reimbursed expenses, which are included in cost of revenues, are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales, marketing and administrative functions (including human resources, legal, finance, quality assurance, compliance and general management) for compensation and benefits, travel, professional services, training and expenses for information technology and facilities. We also incur costs and expenses associated with depreciation and amortization.\nForeign Currency Translation\nIn 2024, approximately 30% of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which represents approximately 60 currencies. Because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and our financial statements are reported in United States dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into United States dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into United States dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results. As a result, we believe that reporting results of operations that exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period to period comparisons. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results. As such, the differences noted below between reported results of operations and constant currency information is wholly attributable to the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFor information regarding our results of operations for our Technology & Analytics Solutions, Research & Development Solutions and Contract Sales & Medical Solutions segments, refer to “Segment Results of Operations” later in this section.\nFor a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2023 and 2022, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed on February 15, 2024. \nRevenues\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nRevenues\n$\n15,405 \n$\n14,984 \n$\n14,410 \n$\n421 \n2.8 \n%\n$\n574 \n4.0 \n%\n2024 compared to 2023\nIn 2024, our revenues increased $421 million, or 2.8%, as compared to 2023. This increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately $510 million, or 3.4%, reflecting a $333 million increase in Technology & Analytics Solutions, a $167 million increase in Research & Development Solutions, and a $10 million increase in Contract Sales & Medical Solutions.\n51\nCost of Revenues, exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n$\n10,030 \n$\n9,745 \n$\n9,382 \n% of revenues\n65.1 \n%\n65.0 \n%\n65.1 \n%\n2024 compared to 2023\nWhen compared to 2023, cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased $285 million in 2024, or 2.9%. This increase included a constant currency increase of approximately $643 million, or 6.6%, comprised of a $261 million increase in Technology & Analytics Solutions, a $374 million increase in Research & Development Solutions, and an $8 million increase in Contract Sales & Medical Solutions.\nAs a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in 2024 remained relatively consistent with 2023.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n1,992 \n$\n2,053 \n$\n2,071 \n% of revenues\n12.9 \n%\n13.7 \n%\n14.4 \n%\n2024 compared to 2023\nThe $61 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2024 as compared to 2023 included a constant currency decrease of approximately $33 million, or 1.6%, comprised of a $52 million increase in Technology & Analytics Solutions, a $42 million increase in Research & Development Solutions, and a $2 million increase in Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, offset by a $129 million decrease in general corporate and unallocated expenses. \nDepreciation and Amortization\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n1,114 \n$\n1,125 \n$\n1,130 \n% of revenues\n7.2 \n%\n7.5 \n%\n7.8 \n%\nThe $11 million decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily the result of less amortization of certain intangible assets from the merger between Quintiles and IMS Health, offset by an increase in amortization of capitalized software and of intangible assets from acquisitions occurring in 2023 and 2024.\nRestructuring Costs\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRestructuring costs\n$\n67 \n$\n84 \n$\n28 \nThe restructuring costs incurred were due to ongoing efforts to streamline our global operations and reduce overcapacity to adapt to changing market conditions and integrate acquisitions. These restructuring actions are expected to occur throughout \n2025\n and are expected to consist of consolidating functional activities, eliminating redundant positions, and aligning resources with customer requirements.\n52\nInterest Income and Interest Expense\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest income\n$\n(47)\n$\n(36)\n$\n(13)\nInterest expense\n$\n670 \n$\n672 \n$\n416 \nInterest income included interest received primarily from bank balances and investments. The increase in 2024 as compared to 2023 is primarily a result of higher deposit rates.\nInterest expense during 2024 was lower than 2023 due primarily to lower base rate interest costs across the floating rate debt portfolio. \nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n$\n— \n$\n6 \n$\n— \nIn 2023 we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of \n$6 million\n for fees and expenses incurred related to the refinancing of our Credit Agreement.

Historically, we recorded deferred tax assets related to certain foreign tax credits, and a full valuation allowance in relation to these foreign tax credits was established as it was not expected the credits would be utilized prior to expiration. We now believe it is reasonably possible that these foreign tax credits will be utilized and therefore we recorded a tax benefit of $64 million related to the valuation allowance release and establishing related uncertain tax positions. Additionally, due to the restructuring we also reversed a deferred tax liability of $61 million due to a basis difference that was recovered in a tax-free manner. The effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by a reversal of uncertain tax positions relating to tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $21 million due to an audit settlement.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates\n$\n5 \n$\n— \n$\n(12)\nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to the results in the operations of our unconsolidated affiliates.\n53\nSegment Results of Operations\nRevenues and profit by segment are as follows:\nSegment Revenues\nSegment Profit\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions\n$\n6,160 \n$\n5,862 \n$\n5,746 \n$\n1,522 \n$\n1,490 \n$\n1,550 \nResearch & Development Solutions\n8,527 \n8,395 \n7,921 \n1,948 \n1,915 \n1,695 \nContract Sales & Medical Solutions\n718 \n727 \n743 \n47 \n49 \n42 \nTotal\n15,405 \n14,984 \n14,410 \n3,517 \n3,454 \n3,287 \nGeneral corporate and unallocated expenses\n(134)\n(268)\n(330)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(1,114)\n(1,125)\n(1,130)\nRestructuring costs\n(67)\n(84)\n(28)\nConsolidated\n$\n15,405 \n$\n14,984 \n$\n14,410 \n$\n2,202 \n$\n1,977 \n$\n1,799 \nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses.

This increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately $333 million, or 5.7%, reflecting revenue growth primarily in the Europe and Africa region and to a lesser extent in the Americas region. The constant currency revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in real world services and to a lesser extent by information and technology services. The constant currency revenue growth for the year was impacted by a decrease in COVID-19 related work.\nCost of Revenues, exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\n2024 compared to 2023\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions’ cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $225 million, or 6.4%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. This increase included a constant currency increase of approximately $261 million, or 7.5%, reflecting primarily an increase in compensation and related expenses, and to a lesser extent increases in reimbursed expenses and costs of acquiring and processing data, all to support revenue growth.\n54\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n2024 compared to 2023\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions’ selling, general and administrative expenses increased $41 million, or 4.7%, in 2024 as compared to 2023.

Contracted backlog was $27.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. \nBacklog represents, at a particular point in time, future revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts. Once work begins on a project, revenues are recognized over the duration of the project. \nWe believe that backlog is an indicator of future revenues but the timing of revenues will be affected by a number of factors, including the variable size and duration of projects, many of which are performed over several years, cancellations, and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects. Projects that have been delayed remain in backlog, but the timing of the revenues generated may differ from the timing originally expected. Additionally, projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities. In the event that a client cancels a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequent client-authorized services related to winding down the canceled project. For more details regarding risks related to our backlog, see Part I, Item IA, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—The relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time.”\nRevenues\n2024 compared to 2023\nResearch & Development Solutions’ revenues were $8,527 million in 2024, an increase of $132 million, or 1.6%, over 2023. This increase was comprised of constant currency revenue growth of approximately $167 million, or 2.0%, reflecting revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific and Europe and Africa regions. The constant currency revenue growth was primarily the result of volume-related increases in clinical services and to a lesser extent from volume-related increases in lab testing. The constant currency revenue growth was impacted by a decrease in COVID-19 related work. \nCost of Revenues, exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\n2024 compared to 2023\nResearch & Development Solutions’ cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $69 million, or 1.2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. This increase included a constant currency increase of approximately $374 million, or 6.6%, reflecting primarily an increase in compensation and related expenses and to a lesser extent an increase in other direct costs because of volume-related increases in clinical services and lab testing.\n55\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n2024 compared to 2023\nResearch & Development Solutions’ selling, general and administrative expenses increased $30 million, or 3.5%, in 2024 as compared to 2023.

Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements, equity repurchases, adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities, and access to the capital markets. \nWe manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost-effective basis. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. We have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the United States and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so.\nWe had a cash balance of $1,702 million as of December 31, 2024 ($713 million of which was in the United States), an increase from $1,376 million as of December 31, 2023.\nBased on our current operating plan, we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. We regularly evaluate our debt arrangements, as well as market conditions, and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates. We may use our existing cash, cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses and/or proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations, to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also continually evaluate new acquisition, expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities, as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses, as appropriate, including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets. Should we elect to pursue any such transaction, we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities. Our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all.\nEquity Repurchase Program\nOn February 5, 2025, the Board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the Repurchase Program with respect to the repurchase of the Company's common stock by an additional $2,000 million, which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the Repurchase Program to $13,725 million. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1,013 million of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. In addition, from time to time, we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the Repurchase Program.\nAdditional information regarding the Repurchase Program is presented in Part II, Item 5 “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” and Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $14,045 million of total indebtedness, excluding $1,170 million of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding our credit arrangements.\nOur long-term debt arrangements contain customary restrictive covenants and, as of December 31, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with our restrictive covenants in all material respects.\n57\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2024, the\n Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"\nCredit Agreement\") provided financing through several senior secured credit facilities (collectively, the “senior secured credit facilities”) of up to approximately $6,585 million, which consisted of $5,415 million principal amounts of debt outstanding and $1,170 million of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility and standby letters of credit, with a total capacity of $2,000 million. The revolving credit facility is comprised of a $1,175 million senior secured revolving facility available in U.S. dollars, a $600 million senior secured revolving facility available in U.S. dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs and other foreign currencies, and a $225 million senior secured revolving facility available in U.S. dollars and Yen. The revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement matures in August 2026, the term A loans mature in August 2026 and June 2027, while the term B loans under the Credit Agreement mature in 2025 and 2031. We are required to make scheduled quarterly payments on the term A loans equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount, with the remaining balance paid at maturity. The US dollars term B loan requires us to make scheduled quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original principal balance amount, with the remaining principal balance due at maturity. In addition, beginning with fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, we were required to apply 50% of excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement), subject to a reduction to 25% or 0% depending upon our senior secured first lien net leverage ratio, for prepayment of the term loans, with any such prepayment to be applied toward principal payments due in subsequent quarters. We are also required to pay an annual commitment fee that ranges from 0.20% to 0.35% in respect of any unused commitments under the revolving credit facility. The senior secured credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our material domestic subsidiaries including 100% of the equity interests of substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the equity interests of substantially all of our first-tier material foreign subsidiaries and their domestic subsidiaries.\nFor information regarding the senior secured credit facilities, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSenior Secured Notes and Senior Notes\nFor information regarding the senior secured notes and senior notes, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReceivables Financing Facility\nFor information regarding the receivables financing facility, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2024, no additional amounts of revolving loan commitments were available under the receivables financing facility.\nYears ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,716\n \n$\n2,149 \n$\n2,260 \n2024 compared to 2023\nCash provided by operating activities increased $567 million in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cash from accounts receivable and unbilled services ($570 million), an increase in cash-related net income ($129 million), more cash from unearned income ($38 million), and less cash used for income tax and other payables ($9 million), offset by more cash used for accounts payable and accrued expenses ($152 million) and more cash used for prepaid expenses and other assets ($27 million).\n58\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(1,444)\n$\n(1,603)\n$\n(2,006)\n2024 compared to 2023\nCash used in investing activities decreased $159 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to less cash used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired ($141 million), less cash used for the acquisition of property, equipment, and software ($47 million), less cash used for investments in debt and equity securities ($36 million), less cash used for purchases of marketable securities ($6 million), and cash received from sale of property, equipment and software ($25 million), offset by more cash used for investments in unconsolidated affiliates, net ($93 million), and less cash from other sources ($3 million). \nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(878)\n$\n(382)\n$\n(329)\n2024 compared to 2023\nCash used in financing activities increased $496 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to less cash provided by proceeds from debt issuances, net of payment of debt issuance costs ($3,951 million), more cash used to repurchase common stock ($358 million), and more cash payments related to employee stock option plans ($3 million), offset by less debt payments ($2,701 million), less\n \ncash used in repayments of revolving credit facilities, net of proceeds ($1,050 million), and less\n \ncash payments on contingent consideration and deferred purchase price accruals ($65 million). \nContingencies\nWe are exposed to certain known contingencies that are material to our investors. The facts and circumstances surrounding these contingencies and a discussion of their effect on us are included in Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These contingencies may have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources or results of operations. In addition, even where our accruals are adequate, the incurrence of any of these liabilities may have a material effect on our liquidity and the amount of cash available to us for other purposes.\nWe believe that we have made appropriate arrangements in respect of the future effect on us of these known contingencies. We also believe that the amount of cash available to us from our operations, together with cash from financing, will be sufficient for us to pay any known contingencies as they become due without materially affecting our ability to conduct our operations and invest in the growth of our business.\n59\nInformation about our Guarantors and the Issuer of our Guaranteed Securities\nIQVIA Inc. (the “Issuer”), a wholly owned subsidiary of IQVIA Holdings Inc., completed the issuance and sale of $1,250 million in gross proceeds of the Issuer’s 6.250% senior secured notes due 2029 (the “2029 Senior Secured Notes”) on November 28, 2023, and completed the issuance and sale of $750 million in gross proceeds of the Issuer’s 5.700% senior secured notes due 2028 (the “2028 Senior Secured Notes”) on May 23, 2023. \nIn February 2024, the Issuer completed an exchange offer in which it issued $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 registered under the Securities Act (the “2029 Registered Notes”) and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.700% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 registered under the Securities Act (the “2028 Registered Notes” and, together with the 2029 Registered Notes, the 2029 Senior Secured Notes, and the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the “Notes”) in exchange for the same principal amount and substantially identical terms of the 2029 Senior Secured Notes and 2028 Senior Secured Notes, respectively.\nThe accompanying summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, “Financial Statements of Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities Registered or Being Registered,” and Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralized a Registrant’s Securities.” Each of our current direct and indirect material U.S. wholly owned restricted subsidiaries (excluding IQVIA Solutions Japan LLC and IQVIA Services Japan LLC) (the \"Guarantor subsidiaries\" and, together with IQVIA Holdings Inc., the “Guarantors”), have jointly and severally, irrevocably and unconditionally, on a senior secured basis, guaranteed the obligations under the Notes. \nThe following presents the summarized financial information on a combined basis for IQVIA Holdings Inc.

Due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2025.\n(5)    As of December 31, 2024, our liability related to uncertain income tax positions was approximately $161 million, $99 million of which has not been included in the above table as we are unable to predict when these liabilities will be paid due to the uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of the income tax positions.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nNote 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n62\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our contracts within the Research & Development Solutions segment are service contracts for clinical research that represent a single performance obligation. We provide a significant integration service resulting in a combined output, which is clinical trial data that meets the relevant regulatory standards and can be used by the customer to progress to the next phase of a clinical trial or solicit approval of a treatment by the applicable regulatory body. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the output is captured in data and documentation that is available for the customer to consume over the course of the arrangement and furthers progress of the clinical trial. We recognize revenues over time using a cost-based input method since there is no single output measure that would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Progress on the performance obligation is measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract. Costs included in the measure of progress include direct labor and third-party costs (such as payments to investigators and other reimbursed expenses for our clinical monitors). This cost-based method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of costs to complete our projects on an ongoing basis. Significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to these estimates. The effect of revisions to estimates related to the transaction price or costs to complete a project are recorded in the period in which the estimate is revised. Most contracts may be terminated upon 30 to 90 days' notice by the customer; however, in the event of termination, most contracts require payment for services rendered through the date of termination, as well as for subsequent services rendered to close out the contract. A hypothetical increase of one percent in the estimated costs to complete these service contracts as of December 31, 2024 could have resulted in approximately a one percent reduction in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, whereas, a hypothetical decrease of one percent could have resulted in a one percent increase in total revenues.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record U.S. deferred taxes based on the Federal corporate income tax rate of 21%, We account for tax related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) and Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Taxes (\"QDMTT\") in relation to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (\"OECD\") Pillar Two global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, as period costs when and if incurred. Recognition of deferred income tax assets is based on management’s belief that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences, income tax operating loss, capital loss carryforwards, and income tax credits, will be realized. We recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which it was more likely than not that realization would not occur. We determined the amount of the valuation allowance based, in part, on our assessment of future taxable income and in light of our ongoing income tax strategies. If our estimate of future taxable income or tax strategies changes at any time in the future, we would record an adjustment to our valuation allowance. Recording such an adjustment could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIncome tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, adjusted as required by the income tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction. Changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate. We do not consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nWe use the acquisition method to account for business combinations, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. We use significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests including expected future cash flows and discount rates that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives.\nWe have recorded and allocated to our reporting units the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired, known as goodwill. The recoverability of goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment, or if and when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of July 31. \n63\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we performed a qualitative impairment evaluation. The qualitative evaluation requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, including those related to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, fair value history and other company specific events. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment evaluation for each of our reporting units. We estimated the fair value of each reporting by weighting results of the income and market approaches, with greater weight given to the income approach. Significant estimates used in the income approach include estimates of future revenues, EBITDA, cash flows, long-term growth rates, tax rates, and discount rates. The selected discount rates consider the risk and nature of the respective reporting unit’s cash flows, and the rates of return a market participant would expect to earn by investing in our reporting units. The market approach uses information about the Company as well as other publicly traded guideline companies, including revenue and EBITDA-related multiples and estimates of control premiums. As part of the quantitative impairment evaluation, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If results of the evaluation indicate the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded by calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill as compared to its carrying amount. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill.\nWe review the carrying values of other identifiable intangible assets if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe measure compensation cost for stock-based payment awards (stock options and stock appreciation rights) granted to employees and non-employee directors at fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Stock-based compensation expense includes stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors and has been reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.\nThe Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including share price volatility, the expected life of the award, risk-free interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. In developing our assumptions, we take into account the following:\n•\nWe calculate expected volatility based on an analysis of the historical volatility of our stock since the Merger in October 2016 and reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available;\n•\nWe determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to implied yields available from United States Treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant;\n•\nWe estimate the dividend yield to be zero as we do not currently anticipate paying any future dividends;\n•\nWe estimate the average expected life of the award based on our historical experience; and\n•\nWe estimate forfeitures based on our historical analysis of actual forfeitures.\nWe account for our stock-based compensation for performance awards related to compound annual earnings per share (“EPS”) growth over a three year period based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, and for performance awards related to relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. We record the expense amount of the EPS awards based on our estimates of the likelihood that the various performance targets will be achieved. The estimates are assessed on a quarterly basis. For the TSR awards we record the expense amount evenly over the service period.\n64\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe provide retirement benefits to certain employees, including defined benefit pension plans. The determination of benefit obligations and expense is based on actuarial models. In order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models, critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, cash balance crediting rate, lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate of compensation increases.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nInformation relating to recently issued accounting standards is included in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
