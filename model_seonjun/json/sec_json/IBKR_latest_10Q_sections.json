MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes in Item 1, included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward\n-\nlooking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward\n-\nlooking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10\n-\nK filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 27, 2025, and elsewhere in this report.\n \nWhen we use the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and “IBKR,” we mean IBG, Inc. and its subsidiaries (including IBG LLC) for the periods presented. \nUnless otherwise indicated, the term “common stock” refers to the Class A common stock of IBG, Inc.\n \nOn April 15, 2025, the Company announced its intention to effect a four-for-one forward split of its common stock. This was executed by the filing of an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation that, among other things (i) increased the Company’s authorized shares of Class A common stock to 4,000,000,000 shares from 1,000,000,000 shares and (ii) increased the Company’s authorized shares of Class B Common Stock to 1,000 shares from 100 shares to accommodate the stock split. The Company’s Board of Directors subsequently authorized the stock split and each holder of record of common stock as of the close of market on June 16, 2025, received three additional shares of common stock. All prior period share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\n \nIntroduction\n \nInteractive Brokers Group, Inc. (the “Company” or “IBG, Inc.”) is a holding company whose primary asset is its ownership of approximately 26.3%\n \nof the membership interests of IBG LLC. The remaining approximately 73.7% of IBG LLC membership interests are held by IBG Holdings LLC (“Holdings”), a holding company that is owned by our founder and Chairman, Mr. Thomas Peterffy and his affiliates, management and other employees of IBG LLC, and certain other members. The table below shows the amount of IBG LLC membership interests held by IBG, Inc. and Holdings as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIBG, Inc.\n \nHoldings\n \nTotal\nOwnership %\n26.3%\n \n73.7%\n \n100.0%\nMembership interests\n 445,405,584\n \n 1,250,737,416\n \n 1,696,143,000\n \n \nWe are an automated global electronic broker. We custody and service accounts for hedge and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), registered investment advisors, proprietary trading groups, introducing brokers and individual investors. We specialize in routing orders and executing and processing trades in stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs and precious metals on more than 160 electronic exchanges and market centers in 37 countries\n \nand 28 currencies\n \naround the world. \nIn addition, our customers can use our trading platform to trade certain cryptocurrencies through third-party cryptocurrency service providers that execute, clear and custody the cryptocurrencies. We also offer trading in forecast contracts, which are event-based contracts traded on ForecastEx LLC, a CFTC-registered exchange and clearinghouse we \nestablished.\n \nAs an electronic broker, we execute, clear and settle trades globally for both institutional and individual customers. Powered by our proprietary technology, our systems provide our customers with the capability to monitor multiple markets around the world simultaneously and to execute trades electronically at a low cost, in multiple products and currencies from a single trading account. Our overnight trading facilities, available for an array of instruments, support our customers who trade across time zones. The ever-growing complexity of multiple market centers across diverse geographies provides us with ongoing opportunities to build and continuously adapt our order routing software to secure excellent execution prices.\n \nSince our inception in 1977, we have focused on developing proprietary software to automate broker\n-\ndealer functions. The proliferation of electronic exchanges and market centers has allowed us to integrate our software with an increasing number of trading venues – as well as with market data sources, securities lending platforms and regulatory reporting facilities – creating one automated platform that requires minimal human intervention.\n \nOur customer base is diverse with respect to geography and type. Currently, our customers reside in over 200 countries and territories.\n \nWe serve individuals, as well as institutional accounts such as hedge funds, financial advisors, proprietary trading firms and introducing brokers. Specialized products and services that we have developed successfully attract institutional accounts. For example, we offer prime brokerage services, including financing and securities lending, to hedge funds; our model portfolio technology and automated share allocation and rebalancing tools are particularly attractive to financial advisors; and our trading platform, global access and low pricing attract introducing brokers.\n‎\n \n\n\n41\nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nBusiness Environment\n \nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2025 (“current quarter”), world equities markets continued their strong performance, with major equity indices rising in most regions. The U.S. market rose 8%, and Europe, the U.K. and Australia recorded single-digit gains, while Germany declined slightly. Markets in Canada, Japan, Hong Kong and China saw double-digit gains this quarter. Several central banks continued to cut their policy interest rates this quarter, including those in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Japan, Europe and Switzerland kept rates unchanged.\n \nThe market continued to recover from concerns earlier this year about the potential imposition of global tariffs, with the S&P 500 up 34% by quarter end from its April lows. This quarter, the market again saw the dominance of a small number of technology stocks (the so-called ‘‘Magnificent 7’’), with those names driving more than half of the S&P 500’s return in the current quarter. More broadly, artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks, including these seven, accounted for nearly three-quarters of the index’s return, underscoring AI’s prominent role as an investment theme. Demand for AI companies also helped spark a rebound in the initial public offering (IPO) market, as investors sought out more opportunities in new technology and AI firms.\n \nThe following summarizes the key economic drivers that affect our business and how they compared to the prior-year quarter:\n \nGlobal trading volumes.\n Worldwide, equities volumes at most major trading venues rose in the current quarter as most major market indices rose, compared to the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., according to industry data, average daily volume in listed cash equities volume increased by 53% and in exchange-listed equity-based options by 25%, while futures volumes declined by 10%, compared to the prior-year quarter. Options trading volumes continue to rise with the growing popularity of shorter-dated options contracts. In futures markets, volumes decreased across most product segments, particularly in interest rate, equity index, foreign exchange and energy, as diminished geopolitical and economic uncertainty reduced hedging activity in those areas. \n \nVarious market cross-currents led to mixed results across our major product types. While our customers’ equities and options volumes were up 67% and 27%, respectively, futures and foreign exchange volumes were down 7% and 6%, respectively, compared to the prior-year quarter.\n \nNote that while U.S. options, futures and cash equities volumes are readily comparable measures, they reflect most but not all of the global volumes that generate our commission revenue. See ‘‘Trading Volumes and Customer Statistics’’ below in this Item 2 for additional details regarding our trade volumes, contract and share volumes, and customer statistics.\n \nVolatility\n. U.S. market volatility, as measured by the average Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (“VIX®”), declined by 6%, from an average of 17.1 in the prior-year quarter to 16.0 in the current quarter, and remained below the elevated levels reached in 2020 and 2022. The less volatile environment reflected steady economic activity, increased confidence in the Federal Reserve’s easing trajectory, and reduced uncertainty surrounding global trade tariff policies.\n \nIn general, higher volatility typically enhances our performance because it often correlates positively with customer trading activity across product types.\n \nInterest Rates\n. During the current quarter, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the benchmark federal funds rate for the first time this year, lowering it by 25 basis points to a range of 4.00% to 4.25%. The U.S. Treasury yield curve remained inverted through the medium term, though less so than in prior quarters. As noted above, in several countries with developed financial markets, benchmark interest rates declined during the current quarter as central banks were inclined to focus more on growth than inflation.\n \nLower U.S. benchmark rates reduce the interest rate we earn on our segregated cash, the majority of which is invested in short-term U.S. government securities and related instruments. Lower medium-term rates, and uncertainty over future U.S. Federal Reserve rate policy, have led us to maintain a short duration portfolio, all of which matured within three months at September 30, 2025, to more closely match our asset and liability maturities on our interest-sensitive assets. Further, our margin balances are tied to benchmark rates, so lower rates also limit the interest we earn on margin lending to our customers. Higher balances can mitigate the impact of rate reductions. We continue to offer among the lowest rates in the industry on margin lending, and we believe our low rates are an important feature that attracts customers to our platform.\n \nAs an offset, lower rates also reduce our interest expense. For example, in U.S. dollars we pay interest to customers on their qualified cash balances when the federal funds effective rate is above 0.50%, which it is currently. Any rate cuts are passed through to our customers, so we maintain a 0.50% spread. We believe the attractive rates we pay on customer cash are among the highest in the industry and are another important feature that draws customers to our platform. \n \n \n \n\n\n42\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nNet interest income on margin loan balances increased 4% compared to the prior-year quarter, despite a 96 basis point decline in the U.S. federal funds rate and rate cuts in other countries. The net interest income increase reflected a 30% increase in margin loan balances and a 33% increase in segregated cash and securities balances driven by our growing customer base. Additionally, interest on securities lending increased due to higher activity during the quarter.\n \nThese factors contributed to a 21% rise in net interest income over the prior-year quarter, while our net interest margin declined from 2.37% in the prior-year quarter to 2.16% in the current quarter, predominantly from global interest rate cuts. See the “Results of Operations – Interest Income and Interest Expense” section below in this Item 2 for additional details.\n \nCurrency fluctuations\n. As a global electronic broker trading on exchanges around the world in multiple currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We actively manage this exposure by keeping our equity in proportion to a defined basket of 10 currencies we call the ‘‘GLOBAL’’ to diversify our risk and to align our hedging strategy with the currencies that we use in our business. Because we report our financial results in U.S. dollars, the change in the value of the GLOBAL versus the U.S. dollar affects our earnings. During the current quarter, the value of the GLOBAL, as measured in U.S. dollars, decreased 0.25% compared to its value at June 30, 2025, which had a negative impact on our comprehensive earnings for the current quarter. \nA discussion of our approach for managing foreign currency exposure is contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled ‘‘Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.’’\n \nFinancial Overview\n \nWe report non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook and are useful in evaluating the operating performance of our business. See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below in this Item 2 for additional details.\n \nDiluted earnings per share were $0.59 for the current quarter, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.42 for the prior-year quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.57 for the current quarter and $0.40 for the prior-year quarter. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is detailed in Note 4 – “Equity and Earnings per Share” to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n \nFor the current quarter, our net revenues were $1,655 million and income before income taxes was $1,312 million, compared to net revenues of $1,365 million and income before income taxes of $909 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted net revenues were $1,610 million and adjusted income before income taxes was $1,267 million, compared to adjusted net revenues of $1,327 million\n \nand adjusted income before income taxes of $871 million\n \nin the prior-year quarter. \n \nFinancial highlights for the current quarter (compared to the prior-year quarter): \n \n\nCommission revenue increased 23% to $537 million on higher customer trading volumes. Customer trading volume in stocks and options increased 67% and 27%, respectively, while futures decreased 7%.\n \n\nNet interest income \nincreased 21% to $967 million on stronger securities lending activity and higher average customer margin loans and customer credit balances.\n \n\nOther fees and services decreased 8% to $66 million, led by a decrease of $12 million in risk exposure fees, which was partially offset by a $3 million increase in FDIC sweep fees.\n \n\nExecution, clearing and distribution fees expenses decreased 21% to $92 million, driven by lower regulatory fees, as the SEC Section 31 transaction fee rate was reduced to zero on May 14, 2025, and greater capture of liquidity rebates from certain exchanges due to higher trading volumes in stocks and options.\n \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased 59% to $62 million, driven primarily by the non-recurrences of $88 million related to legal and regulatory matters and of $12 million related to the consolidation of our European subsidiaries; partially offset by an increase of $10 million in advertising expenses.\n \n\nPretax profit margin was 79% for the current quarter compared to 67% in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted pretax profit margin for the current quarter was 79% compared to 66% in the prior-year quarter.\n \n\nTotal equity as of September 30, 2025, was $19.5 billion.\n‎\n \n\n\n43\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\nIn connection with our currency diversification strategy,\n \nas of September 30, 2025, approximately 25% of our equity was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In the current quarter, our currency diversification strategy decreased our comprehensive earnings by $33 million (compared to an increase of $178 million in the prior-year quarter), as the U.S. dollar value of the GLOBAL decreased by approximately 0.25% compared to its value as of June 30, 2025. The effects of our currency diversification strategy are reported as (1) a component of “Other income” (gain of $4 million) in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and (2) \nother comprehensive income\n (“OCI”) (loss of\n \n$37 million) in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The full effect of the GLOBAL is captured in comprehensive income. \n \nCertain Trends and Uncertainties \n \nWe believe that our current operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations:\n \n•\nRetail participation in the equity markets has fluctuated in the past due to investor sentiment, market conditions and a variety of other factors. Retail transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable.\n \n\nConsolidation among market centers may adversely affect the value of our IB SmartRouting\nSM\n software.\n \n\nCompetition among broker-dealers may continue to intensify.\n \n•\nBenchmark interest rates tend to fluctuate with economic conditions. Changes in interest rates may not be predictable. \n \n\nFiscal and/or monetary policy may change and impact the financial services business and securities markets.\n \n•\nNew legislation or modifications to existing regulations and rules could occur in the future. Scrutiny in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and information security by regulatory and legislative authorities has increased.\n \n\nThe impact of another pandemic or a public health emergency will depend on numerous evolving factors that cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, governmental regulations in response to the pandemic, and the effectiveness of vaccinations and other medical advancements. \n \n\nWe continue to be exposed to the risks and uncertainties of doing business in international markets, particularly in the heavily regulated brokerage industry. Such risks and uncertainties include political, economic and financial instability, and foreign policy changes. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated in recent years, and changes in Chinese governmental oversight of the Chinese and Hong Kong capital markets could result in adverse effects on our business and loss of assets we hold in the region. Additionally, although our direct and indirect exposures to Russia and Ukraine are not material, the war in Ukraine and related sanctions have created substantial uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets. \n \n•\nOur remaining market making activities, while not material, will continue to be impacted by market structure changes, market conditions, the level of automation of competitors, and the relationship between actual and implied volatility in the equities markets. \n \nSee “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10\n-\nK, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2025, and elsewhere in this report for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n‎\n \n\n\n44\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \n \nTrading Volumes and Customer Statistics\n \nThe tables below present historical trading volumes and customer statistics for our business. Trading volumes are the primary driver in our business. Information on our net interest income can be found elsewhere in this report.\n \nEXECUTED ORDER VOLUMES:\n(in thousands, except %)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCustomer\n \n%\n \nPrincipal\n \n%\n \nTotal\n \n%\nPeriod\n \nOrders\n \nChange\n \nOrders\n \nChange\n \nOrders\n \nChange\n2022\n \n 532,064 \n \n \n \n 26,966 \n \n \n \n 559,030 \n \n \n2023\n \n 483,015 \n \n(9%)\n \n 29,712 \n \n10%\n \n 512,727 \n \n(8%)\n2024\n \n 661,666 \n \n37%\n \n 63,348 \n \n113%\n \n 725,014 \n \n41%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3Q2024\n \n 171,620 \n \n \n \n 17,722 \n \n \n \n 189,342 \n \n \n3Q2025\n \n 229,635 \n \n34%\n \n 30,659 \n \n73%\n \n 260,294 \n \n37%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2Q2025\n \n 220,215 \n \n \n \n 28,372 \n \n \n \n 248,587 \n \n \n3Q2025\n \n 229,635 \n \n4%\n \n 30,659 \n \n8%\n \n 260,294 \n \n5%\n \nCONTRACT AND SHARE VOLUMES:\n(in thousands, except %)\n \nTOTAL\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOptions\n \n%\n \nFutures \n1\n \n%\n \nStocks\n \n%\nPeriod\n \n(contracts)\n \nChange\n \n(contracts)\n \nChange\n \n(shares)\n \nChange\n2022\n \n 908,415 \n \n \n \n 207,138 \n \n \n \n 330,035,586 \n \n \n2023\n \n 1,020,736 \n \n12%\n \n 209,034 \n \n1%\n \n 252,742,847 \n \n(23%)\n2024\n \n 1,344,855 \n \n32%\n \n 218,327 \n \n4%\n \n 307,489,711 \n \n22%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3Q2024\n \n 344,540 \n \n \n \n 56,825 \n \n \n \n 72,117,770 \n \n \n3Q2025\n \n 428,524 \n \n24%\n \n 52,233 \n \n(8%)\n \n 119,250,686 \n \n65%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2Q2025\n \n 393,051 \n \n \n \n 64,271 \n \n \n \n 96,450,620 \n \n \n3Q2025\n \n 428,524 \n \n9%\n \n 52,233 \n \n(19%)\n \n 119,250,686 \n \n24%\n \nCUSTOMER\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOptions\n \n%\n \nFutures \n1\n \n%\n \nStocks\n \n%\nPeriod\n \n(contracts)\n \nChange\n \n(contracts)\n \nChange\n \n(shares)\n \nChange\n2022\n \n 873,914 \n \n \n \n 203,933 \n \n \n \n 325,368,714 \n \n \n2023\n \n 981,172 \n \n12%\n \n 206,073 \n \n1%\n \n 248,588,960 \n \n(24%)\n2024\n \n 1,290,770 \n \n32%\n \n 214,864 \n \n4%\n \n 302,040,873 \n \n22%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3Q2024\n \n 330,173 \n \n \n \n 56,078 \n \n \n \n 70,751,412 \n \n \n3Q2025\n \n 418,389 \n \n27%\n \n 51,936 \n \n(7%)\n \n 118,307,826 \n \n67%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2Q2025\n \n 382,195 \n \n \n \n 63,918 \n \n \n \n 95,276,485 \n \n \n3Q2025\n \n 418,389 \n \n9%\n \n 51,936 \n \n(19%)\n \n 118,307,826 \n \n24%\n_________________________\n1.\nFutures contract volume includes options on futures.\n \n‎\n \n\n\n45\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \n \nPRINCIPAL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOptions\n \n%\n \nFutures \n1\n \n%\n \nStocks\n \n%\nPeriod\n \n(contracts)\n \nChange\n \n(contracts)\n \nChange\n \n(shares)\n \nChange\n2022\n \n 34,501 \n \n \n \n 3,205 \n \n \n \n 4,666,872 \n \n \n2023\n \n 39,564 \n \n15%\n \n 2,961 \n \n(8%)\n \n 4,153,887 \n \n(11%)\n2024\n \n 54,085 \n \n37%\n \n 3,463 \n \n17%\n \n 5,448,838 \n \n31%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3Q2024\n \n 14,367 \n \n \n \n 747 \n \n \n \n 1,366,358 \n \n \n3Q2025\n \n 10,135 \n \n(29%)\n \n 297 \n \n(60%)\n \n 942,860 \n \n(31%)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2Q2025\n \n 10,856 \n \n \n \n 353 \n \n \n \n 1,174,135 \n \n \n3Q2025\n \n 10,135 \n \n(7%)\n \n 297 \n \n(16%)\n \n 942,860 \n \n(20%)\n________________________\n1.\nFutures contract volume includes options on futures. \n \nCUSTOMER STATISTICS:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYear over Year\n \n3Q2025\n \n3Q2024\n \n% Change\nTotal Accounts (in thousands)\n \n \n 4,127 \n \n \n 3,120 \n \n32%\nCustomer Equity (in billions) \n1\n \n$\n 757.5 \n \n$\n 541.5 \n \n40%\nTotal Customer DARTs (in thousands) \n2\n \n \n 3,616 \n \n \n 2,703 \n \n34%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCleared Customers\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommission per Cleared Commissionable Order \n3\n \n$\n 2.70 \n \n$\n 2.83 \n \n(5%)\nCleared Avg.

The increase in net revenues was due to higher net interest income, commissions and other income; partially offset by lower other fees and services.\n \nCommissions\n \nWe earn commissions from our cleared customers for whom we act as an executing and clearing broker and from our non\n-\ncleared customers for whom we act as an execution\n-\nonly broker. Our commission structure allows customers to choose between (1) an all\n-\ninclusive fixed, or “bundled”, rate; (2) a tiered, or “unbundled”, rate that offers lower commissions for high volume customers where we pass through regulatory and exchange fees; and (3) our \nIBKR Lite\nSM\n offering, \nwhich provides commission-free trades on U.S. exchange-listed stocks and ETFs. \nIBKR Lite\nSM\n trades\n generate payments from market makers and others to whom we route these orders, which are reported in commissions\n. \nOur commissions are geographically diversified.\n \nCommissions, for the current quarter, increased $102 million, or 23%, compared to the prior-year quarter, to $537 million, driven by higher customer volume in stocks and options; partially offset by lower customer trading volumes in futures. Total customer stock share and options contract volumes increased 67% and 27%, respectively, while futures contract volume decreased 7%. Total DARTs for the current quarter increased 34% to 3.6 million, compared to 2.7 million for the prior-year quarter. Average commission per commissionable order for cleared customers decreased 5% to $2.70 for the current quarter compared to $2.83 for the prior-year quarter, due to lower average commissions per contract in stocks and options, primarily due to the SEC Section 31 transaction fee rate which was reduced to zero on May 14, 2025, and to greater capture of liquidity rebates, which, as pass-throughs, serve to lower both our commission revenues and our execution costs.\n \nOther Fees and Services\n \n \nWe earn fee income on services provided to customers, which includes market data fees, risk exposure fees, payments for order flow from exchange-mandated programs, FDIC sweep fees, and other fees and services charged to customers.\n \nOther fees and services, for the current quarter, decreased $6 million, or 8%, compared to the prior-year quarter, to $66 million, driven by a $12 million decrease in risk exposure fees as customers exhibited more cautious risk-taking behavior, partially offset by a $3 million increase in FDIC sweep fees and a $2 million increase in market data fees.\n \nOther Income\n \n \nOther income consists of foreign exchange gains (losses) from our currency diversification strategy, gains (losses) from principal transactions, gains (losses) from our equity method and other investments, and other revenue not directly attributable to our core business offerings. A discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”\n \nOther income, for the current quarter, increased $29 million, or 52% compared to the prior-year quarter, to $85 million. This increase was mainly due to $42 million related to our investing activities, \npartially offset by a $21 million lower gain related to our currency diversification strategy, which gained $4 million in the current quarter compared to a gain of $25 million in the prior-year quarter.\n \nInterest Income and Interest Expense\n \n \nWe earn interest on margin lending to customers that is secured by marketable securities and currency balances these customers hold with us; from our investments in U.S. and foreign government securities; from borrowing and lending securities; on deposits (in positive interest rate currencies) with banks; and on certain customers’ cash balances in negative rate currencies. We pay interest on customer cash balances (in sufficiently positive interest rate currencies); for borrowing and lending securities; on deposits (in negative interest rate currencies) with banks; and on our borrowings.\n \nNet interest income (interest income less interest expense), for the current quarter, increased $165 million, or 21%, compared to the prior-year quarter, to $967 million. The increase in net interest income was driven by stronger securities lending activity and higher average customer margin loans and customer credit balances, partially offset by lower benchmark interest rates. \n \n\n\n48\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nNet interest income on customer balances, for the current quarter, increased $48 million compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by increases of $34.9 billion, $20.1 billion and $16.2 billion in average customer credit balances, segregated cash and securities, and margin loans, respectively. Yields on all three components decreased as rates have declined worldwide. See the “Business Environment” section above in this Item 2 for a further discussion about the change in interest rates in the current quarter. \n \nThe Company measures return on interest-earning assets using net interest margin (“NIM”). NIM is computed by dividing the annualized net interest income by the average interest-earning assets for the period. Interest-earning assets consist of cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes (including U.S. government securities and \nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell)\n, customer margin loans, securities borrowed, other interest-earning assets (solely firm assets) and customer cash balances swept into FDIC-insured banks as part of our Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program. Interest-bearing liabilities consist of customer credit balances, securities loaned, and other interest-bearing liabilities.\n \nYields are generally a reflection of benchmark interest rates in each currency in which the Company and its customers hold cash balances. Because a meaningful portion of customer cash and margin loans are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, changes in U.S. benchmark interest rates do not impact the total amount of segregated cash and securities, customer margin loans and customer credit balances. Furthermore, because interest, when benchmark rates are at sufficiently high levels, is paid only on eligible cash credit balances (i.e., balances over $10 thousand or equivalent, in securities accounts with over $100 thousand in equity, and in smaller accounts at reduced rates), changes in benchmark interest rates are not passed through to the total amount of customer credit balances. Finally, the Company’s policies with respect to currencies with near zero or negative interest rates impact the overall yields on segregated cash and customer credit balances as effective interest rates in those currencies move above or below zero. \n \nWe earn income on securities loaned and borrowed to support customer long and short stock holdings in margin accounts.\n \nOur Stock Yield Enhancement Program provides an opportunity for customers with fully-paid stock to allow us to lend it out. We pay customers a rebate on the cash collateral generally equal to 50% of a market-based rate for lending the shares. We place cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities as collateral securing the loans in the customer’s account, which is held in segregated accounts or at an affiliate acting as collateral agent for the benefit of our customer.\n \nA securities lending transaction generates (1) net interest earned on lending a security, which is based on supply and demand for that security, and (2) interest earned on the cash collateral deposited for the loan of that security, which is based on benchmark interest rates. Interest on this collateral is reported as net interest on segregated cash, since cash collateral from securities lending is held in specially-designated bank accounts for the benefit of customers, in accordance with U.S. customer protection rules. Generally, as benchmark interest rates rise, while the overall revenue generated from a securities lending transaction may not change, the portion derived from interest earned on the cash collateral, which is classified as net interest income on “Segregated cash and securities, net” increases, while the portion classified as “Securities borrowed and loaned, net” decreases. \n \nIn the current quarter, average securities borrowed balances increased 45%, to $9.0 billion, and average securities loaned balances increased 45%, to $20.7 billion, compared to the prior-year quarter. Net interest earned from securities lending is affected by the level of demand for securities positions held by our customers that investors are looking to sell short. During the current quarter, net interest earned from securities lending transactions increased $117 million, or 731%, compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by a higher level of short sale activity and a significant rise in the notional value of the securities we lent. However, as noted above, the rise in benchmark interest rates from near zero in 2022 has shifted a portion of the interest reported as generated by lending securities to interest income on segregated cash (see further explanation above). It should be noted that securities lending transactions entered into to support customer activity may produce interest income (expense) that is offset by interest expense (income) related to customer balances.\n \nWe estimate that if the interest earned and paid on cash collateral related to our securities lending transactions were included under “Securities borrowed and loaned, net” in the table below, the total net interest income related to our securities lending activities would have been $314 million in the current quarter, compared to $156 million in the prior-year quarter. Such additional interest attributed to our securities lending activities would be reclassified from net interest income on “Segregated cash and securities, net” and “Customer credit balances, net” in the table below, so it would have no effect on our overall net interest income or net interest margin.\n \n \n‎\n \n\n\n49\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nThe table below presents net interest income information corresponding to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(in millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAverage interest-earning assets\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSegregated cash and securities\n \n$\n 81,906 \n \n$\n 61,813 \nCustomer margin loans\n \n \n 70,805 \n \n \n 54,647 \nSecurities borrowed\n \n \n 9,037 \n \n \n 6,241 \nOther interest-earning assets\n \n \n 16,037 \n \n \n 11,678 \nFDIC sweeps \n1,3\n \n \n 5,962 \n \n \n 4,330 \n \n \n$\n 183,747 \n \n$\n 138,709 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAverage interest-bearing liabilities\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCustomer credit balances\n \n$\n 141,763 \n \n$\n 106,865 \nSecurities loaned\n \n \n 20,691 \n \n \n 14,258 \nOther interest-bearing liabilities\n \n \n 361 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n$\n 162,815 \n \n$\n 121,124 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet interest income\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSegregated cash and securities, net\n \n$\n 786 \n \n$\n 763 \nCustomer margin loans \n2\n \n \n 821 \n \n \n 787 \nSecurities borrowed and loaned, net \n \n \n 133 \n \n \n 16 \nCustomer credit balances, net \n2\n \n \n (945)\n \n \n (936)\nOther net interest income \n1,3\n \n \n 204 \n \n \n 196 \nNet interest income \n3\n \n$\n 999 \n \n$\n 826 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet interest margin (\"NIM\")\n \n \n2.16%\n \n \n2.37%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Annualized Yields\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSegregated cash and securities\n \n \n3.81%\n \n \n4.91%\nCustomer margin loans\n \n \n4.60%\n \n \n5.73%\nCustomer credit balances\n \n \n2.64%\n \n \n3.48%\n______________________________\n1.\nRepresents the average amount of customer cash swept into FDIC-insured banks as part of our Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program.

For the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, $10 million and $7 million were reported in other fees and services, respectively; and $22 million and $17 million were reported in other income, respectively. \n \nNon\n-\nInterest Expenses\n \nNon-interest expenses, for the current quarter, decreased $113 million, or 25%, compared to the prior-year quarter, to $343 million, mainly due to a $91 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, a $24 million decrease in execution, clearing and distribution fees, and a $9 million decrease in customer bad debt expense; partially offset by an $11 million increase in employee compensation and benefits. As a percentage of total net revenues, non-interest expenses were 21% for the current quarter and 33% for the prior-year quarter.\n \n \n\n\n50\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nExecution, Clearing\n and Distribution Fees\n \n \nExecution, clearing and distribution fees include the costs of executing and clearing trades, net of liquidity rebates received from various exchanges and market centers, as well as regulatory fees and market data fees. Execution fees are paid primarily to electronic exchanges and market centers on which we trade. Clearing fees are paid to clearing houses and clearing agents. Market data fees, which are associated with market data revenue included in other fees and services, are paid to third parties to receive streaming price quotes and related information. \n \nExecution, clearing and distribution fees, for the current quarter, decreased $24 million, or 21%,\n \ncompared to the prior-year quarter, to $92 million, mainly driven by a $17 million decrease in regulatory fees as the SEC Section 31 transaction fee rate was reduced to zero on May 14, 2025, and by greater capture of liquidity rebates from certain exchanges on higher customer trading volumes in stocks and options; partially offset by a new FINRA Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”) fee, which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024. SEC and CAT fees, as with other regulatory fees, are passed through to customers. As a percentage of total net revenues, execution, clearing and distribution fees were 6% for the current quarter and 8% for the prior-year quarter. \n \nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\n \nEmployee compensation and benefits include salaries, bonuses and other incentive compensation plans, group insurance, contributions to benefit programs and other related employee costs. \n \nEmployee compensation and benefits expenses, for the current quarter, increased $11 million, or 8%,\n \ncompared to the prior-year quarter, to $156 million, associated with a combination of staffing increases and inflation. The average number of employees increased 5% to 3,109 for the current quarter, compared to 2,960 for the prior-year quarter. As we continue to grow, our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff. As a percentage of total net revenues, employee compensation and benefits expenses were \n9% \nfor the current quarter and 11% for the prior-year quarter.\n \nOccupancy, Depreciation and Amortization\n \nOccupancy expenses consist primarily of rental payments on office and data center leases and related occupancy costs, such as utilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses result from the depreciation of fixed assets, such as computing and communications hardware, as well as amortization of leasehold improvements and capitalized in\n-\nhouse software development. \n \nOccupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses, for the current quarter, decreased $2 million, or 8%, compared to the prior-year quarter, to $24 million, mainly due to lower depreciation and amortization expense. As a percentage of total net revenues, occupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses were 1% for the current quarter and 2% for the prior-year quarter.\n \nCommunications \n \nCommunications expenses consist primarily of the cost of voice and data telecommunications lines supporting our business, including connectivity to exchanges and market centers around the world.\n \nCommunications expenses, for the current quarter, increased $2 million, or 22%, compared to the prior-year quarter, to $11 million.

See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below in this Item 2 for additional details.\n‎\n \n\n\n52\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n (“current nine-month period”) compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 (“prior-year nine-month period”)\n \nNet Revenues\n \nTotal net revenues, for the current nine-month period, increased $764 million, or 20%, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to $4,562 million. The increase in net revenues was due to higher commissions, net interest income, other income, and other fees and services. \n \nCommissions\n \nCommissions, for the current nine-month period, increased $347 million, or 28%, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to $1,567 million, driven by higher customer trading volumes across all product types. Total customer options and futures contract and stock share volumes increased 25%, 9% and 49%, respectively. Total DARTs for the current nine-month period increased 44% to 3.6 million, compared to 2.5 million for the prior-year nine-month period. Average commission per commissionable order for cleared customers, for the current nine-month period, decreased 8% to $2.70, compared to $2.92\n \nfor the prior-year nine-month period, mainly due to greater capture of liquidity rebates passed through to customers.\n \nOther Fees and Services\n \n \nOther fees and services, for the current nine-month period, increased $7 million, or 4%, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to $206 million, driven by a $7 million increase in FDIC sweep fees due to higher customer balances, a $6 million increase in market data fees due to higher number of customers, and a $2 million increase in payments for order flow from exchange-mandated programs driven by higher customer trading volumes; partially offset by a $10 million decrease in risk exposure fees as customers exhibited more cautious risk-taking behavior. \n \nOther Income\n \n \nOther income, for the current nine-month period, increased $154 million, or 405%, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to $192 million. This increase was mainly due to (1) $85 million related to our investing activities, (2) the non-recurrence of a loss of $48 million on positions taken over as a customer accommodation due to a technical issue at the New York Stock Exchange that occurred on the morning of June 3, 2024, as previously disclosed; and (3)\n $16 million related to our currency diversification strategy, which gained $19 million in the current nine-month period compared to $3 million in the prior-year nine-month period.\n \nInterest Income and Interest Expense\n \n \nNet interest income (interest income less interest expense), for the current nine-month period, increased $256 million, or 11%, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to $2,597 million. The increase in net interest income was driven by stronger securities lending activity and higher average customer margin loans and customer credit balances, partially offset by lower benchmark interest rates. In the current nine-month period, \nnet interest income includes a $26 million one-time credit related to recovery of taxes withheld at source.\n \nNet interest income on customer balances, for the current nine-month period, increased $115 million compared to the prior-year nine-month period, driven by increases of $27.2 billion, $14.9 billion and $14.1 billion in average customer credit balances, segregated cash and securities, and margin loans, respectively. Yields on all three components decreased as rates have declined worldwide. See the “Business Environment” section above in this Item 2 for a further discussion about the change in interest rates in the current nine-month period. \n \nThe Company measures return on interest-earning assets using net interest margin (“NIM”). NIM is computed by dividing the annualized net interest income by the average interest-earning assets for the period. Interest-earning assets consist of cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes (including U.S. government securities and \nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell)\n, customer margin loans, securities borrowed, other interest-earning assets (solely firm assets) and customer cash balances swept into FDIC-insured banks as part of our Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program. Interest-bearing liabilities consist of customer credit balances, securities loaned, and other interest-bearing liabilities.\n \nYields are generally a reflection of benchmark interest rates in each currency in which the Company and its customers hold cash balances. Because a meaningful portion of customer cash and margin loans are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, changes in U.S. benchmark interest rates do not impact the total amount of segregated cash and securities, customer margin loans and customer credit balances. Furthermore, because interest, when benchmark rates are at sufficiently high levels, is paid only on eligible cash credit balances (i.e., balances over $10 thousand or equivalent, in securities accounts with over $100 thousand in equity, and in smaller accounts at reduced rates), changes in benchmark interest rates are not passed through to the total amount of customer credit balances. \n\n\n53\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\nFinally, the Company’s policies with respect to currencies with near zero or negative interest rates impact the overall yields on segregated cash and customer credit balances as effective interest rates in those currencies move above or below zero. \n \nWe earn income on securities loaned and borrowed to support customer long and short stock holdings in margin accounts.\n \nOur Stock Yield Enhancement Program provides an opportunity for customers with fully-paid stock to allow us to lend it out. We pay customers a rebate on the cash collateral generally equal to 50% of a market-based rate for lending the shares. We place cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities as collateral securing the loans in the customer’s account, which is held in segregated accounts or at an affiliate acting as collateral agent for the benefit of our customer.\n \nA securities lending transaction generates (1) net interest earned on lending a security, which is based on supply and demand for that security, and (2) interest earned on the cash collateral deposited for the loan of that security, which is based on benchmark interest rates. Interest on this collateral is reported as net interest on segregated cash, since cash collateral from securities lending is held in specially-designated bank accounts for the benefit of customers, in accordance with U.S. customer protection rules. Generally, as benchmark interest rates rise, while the overall revenue generated from a securities lending transaction may not change, the portion derived from interest earned on the cash collateral, which is classified as net interest income on “Segregated cash and securities, net” increases, while the portion classified as “Securities borrowed and loaned, net” decreases. \n \nIn the current nine-month period, average securities borrowed balances increased 20%, to $7.0 billion, and average securities loaned balances increased 36%, to $18.0 billion, compared to the prior-year nine-month period. Net interest earned from securities lending is affected by the level of demand for securities positions held by our customers that investors are looking to sell short. During the current nine-month period, net interest earned from securities lending transactions increased $137 million, or 204%, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, driven by a higher level of short sale activity and a significant rise in the notional value of the securities we lent. However, as noted above, the rise in benchmark interest rates from near zero in 2022 has shifted a portion of the interest reported as generated by lending securities to interest income on segregated cash (see further explanation above). It should be noted that securities lending transactions entered into to support customer activity may produce interest income (expense) that is offset by interest expense (income) related to customer balances.\n \nWe estimate that if the interest earned and paid on cash collateral related to our securities lending transactions were included under “Securities borrowed and loaned, net” in the table below, the total net interest income related to our securities lending activities would have been $751 million in the current nine-month period, compared to $517 million in the prior-year nine-month period. Such additional interest attributed to our securities lending activities would be reclassified from net interest income on “Segregated cash and securities, net” and “Customer credit balances, net” in the table below, so it would have no effect on our overall net interest income or net interest margin.\n \n \n‎\n \n\n\n54\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nThe table below presents net interest income information corresponding to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(in millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAverage interest-earning assets\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSegregated cash and securities\n \n$\n 75,934 \n \n$\n 61,000 \nCustomer margin loans\n \n \n 65,380 \n \n \n 51,240 \nSecurities borrowed\n \n \n 6,995 \n \n \n 5,836 \nOther interest-earning assets\n \n \n 14,784 \n \n \n 10,949 \nFDIC sweeps \n1,4\n \n \n 5,329 \n \n \n 4,071 \n \n \n$\n 168,422 \n \n$\n 133,096 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAverage interest-bearing liabilities\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCustomer credit balances\n \n$\n 130,262 \n \n$\n 103,028 \nSecurities loaned\n \n \n 18,007 \n \n \n 13,227 \nOther interest-bearing liabilities\n \n \n 160 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n$\n 148,429 \n \n$\n 116,256 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet interest income\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSegregated cash and securities, net \n2\n \n$\n 2,205 \n \n$\n 2,267 \nCustomer margin loans \n3\n \n \n 2,305 \n \n \n 2,220 \nSecurities borrowed and loaned, net \n \n \n 204 \n \n \n 67 \nCustomer credit balances, net \n3\n \n \n (2,619)\n \n \n (2,711)\nOther net interest income \n1,4\n \n \n 559 \n \n \n 550 \nNet interest income \n4\n \n$\n 2,654 \n \n$\n 2,393 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet interest margin (\"NIM\")\n \n \n2.11%\n \n \n2.40%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Annualized Yields\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSegregated cash and securities\n \n \n3.88%\n \n \n4.96%\nCustomer margin loans\n \n \n4.71%\n \n \n5.79%\nCustomer credit balances\n \n \n2.69%\n \n \n3.51%\n______________________________\n1.\nRepresents the average amount of customer cash swept into FDIC-insured banks as part of our Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program.

CAT fees, as with other regulatory fees, are passed through to customers. As a percentage of total net revenues, execution, clearing and distribution fees were 7% for the current nine-month period and 9% for the \nprior-year nine-month period\n.\n \nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\n \nEmployee compensation and benefits expenses, for the current nine-month period, increased $37 million, or 8%,\n \ncompared to the prior-year nine-month period, to $473 million associated with a combination of staffing increases, inflation, and a $7 million increase in U.S. Social Security and Medicare and other social insurance taxes driven by the annual vesting of the Company’s Stock Incentive Plan units at a higher stock price than in the prior year. The average number of employees increased 4% to 3,061 for the current nine-month period, compared to 2,951 for the prior-year nine-month period. As we continue to grow, our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff.

As a percentage of total net revenues, occupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses were 2% for both the current nine-month period and the prior-year nine-month period.\n \nCommunications \n \nCommunications expenses, for the current nine-month period increased $3 million, or 10%, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to $32 million. As a percentage of total net revenues, communications expenses were 1% for both the current nine-month period and the prior-year nine-month period.\n \nGeneral and Administrative\n \nGeneral and administrative expenses, for the current nine-month period, decreased $70 million, or 27%, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to $185 million, primarily due to the non-recurrences of $88 million related to a legal settlement and of $12 million related to the consolidation of our European subsidiaries; partially offset by a $27 million increase in advertising expenses. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses were 4% for the current nine-month period and 7% for the prior-year nine-month period.\n \nCustomer Bad Debt\n \nCustomer bad debt expense, for the current nine-month period, decreased $14 million, compared to the prior-year nine-month period, to less than $1 million, mainly driven by the non-recurrence of customer losses during short periods of extreme market volatility in the prior-year nine-month period.\n‎\n \n\n\n56\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nIncome Tax Expense \nWe pay U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on our taxable income, which is proportional to the percentage we own of IBG LLC.

These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net revenues, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income available for common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important measures of our financial performance because they exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. \nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the operating performance of the business.\n \n•\nWe define adjusted net revenues as net revenues adjusted to remove the effect of our currency diversification strategy and our net mark-to-market gains (losses) on investments.\n \n•\nWe define adjusted income before income taxes as income before income taxes adjusted to remove the effect of our currency diversification strategy and our net mark-to-market gains (losses) on investments.\n \n•\nWe define adjusted net income available to common stockholders as net income available for common stockholders adjusted to remove the after-tax effects attributable to IBG, Inc. of our currency diversification strategy and our net mark-to-market gains (losses) on investments.\n \n•\nWe define adjusted diluted\n EPS as adjusted net income available for common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.\n \nMark-to-market on investments represents the net mark-to-market gains (losses) \non investments in equity securities that do not qualify for equity method accounting, which are measured at fair value; \non our U.S. government and municipal securities portfolios, which are typically held to maturity; and \non certain other investments, including equity securities taken over by the Company from customers as a customer accommodation due to a technical issue at the New York Stock Exchange on the morning of June 3, 2024, as previously disclosed. In the event an investment is sold prior to maturity, accumulated gains (losses) are realized and previously accumulated non-GAAP adjustments are reversed in the period of sale\n.\n \nWe also report compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of adjusted net revenues, as we believe this measure is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the growth of our workforce in relation to the growth of our core revenues.\n \nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP \n1\n. \n__________________________\n1.\nRefers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\n‎\n\n\n58\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\nThe tables below present a reconciliation of consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjusted net revenues (in millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet revenues - GAAP\n \n$\n1,655\n \n$\n1,365\n \n$\n4,562\n \n$\n3,798\nNon-GAAP adjustments\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCurrency diversification strategy, net\n \n \n(4)\n \n \n(25)\n \n \n(19)\n \n \n(3)\nMark-to-market on investments\n \n \n(41)\n \n \n (13)\n \n \n(57)\n \n \n 38\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments\n \n \n(45)\n \n \n(38)\n \n \n(76)\n \n \n35\nAdjusted net revenues\n \n$\n1,610\n \n$\n1,327\n \n$\n4,486\n \n$\n3,833\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjusted income before income taxes (in millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIncome before income taxes - GAAP\n \n$\n1,312\n \n$\n909\n \n$\n3,471\n \n$\n2,655\nNon-GAAP adjustments\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCurrency diversification strategy, net\n \n \n(4)\n \n \n(25)\n \n \n(19)\n \n \n(3)\nMark-to-market on investments\n \n \n (41)\n \n \n (13)\n \n \n (57)\n \n \n 38\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments\n \n \n (45)\n \n \n (38)\n \n \n (76)\n \n \n 35\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n \n$\n1,267\n \n$\n871\n \n$\n3,395\n \n$\n2,690\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjusted pre-tax profit margin\n \n \n79%\n \n \n66%\n \n \n76%\n \n \n70%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjusted net income available for common stockholders (in millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet income available for common stockholders - GAAP\n \n$\n263\n \n$\n184\n \n$\n700\n \n$\n538\nNon-GAAP adjustments\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCurrency diversification strategy, net\n \n \n (1)\n \n \n(6)\n \n \n (5)\n \n \n(1)\nMark-to-market on investments\n \n \n (11)\n \n \n (3)\n \n \n (15)\n \n \n 10\nIncome tax effect of above adjustments \n1\n \n \n 3\n \n \n2\n \n \n 5\n \n \n(2)\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments\n \n \n (9)\n \n \n (8)\n \n \n (15)\n \n \n 7\nAdjusted net income available for common stockholders\n \n$\n253\n \n$\n176\n \n$\n684\n \n$\n545\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjusted diluted EPS (in dollars, except share amounts)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiluted EPS - GAAP\n \n$\n0.59\n \n$\n0.42\n \n$\n1.58\n \n$\n1.24\nNon-GAAP adjustments\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCurrency diversification strategy, net\n \n \n(0.00)\n \n \n(0.01)\n \n \n(0.01)\n \n \n(0.00)\nMark-to-market on investments\n \n \n(0.02)\n \n \n(0.01)\n \n \n(0.03)\n \n \n0.02\nIncome tax effect of above adjustments \n1\n \n \n0.01\n \n \n0.01\n \n \n0.02\n \n \n(0.00)\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments\n \n \n(0.02)\n \n \n(0.02)\n \n \n(0.03)\n \n \n0.02\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n \n$\n0.57\n \n$\n0.40\n \n$\n1.55\n \n$\n1.25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n \n \n446,528,983\n \n \n438,145,440\n \n \n442,507,940\n \n \n435,096,780\n \n \nNote: Amounts may not add due to rounding.\n______________________________\n1.\nThe income tax effect is estimated using the statutory income tax rates applicable to the Company.\n‎\n \n\n\n59\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nWe maintain a highly liquid balance sheet. The majority of our assets consists of investments of customer funds, collateralized receivables arising from customer\n-\nrelated and proprietary securities transactions, and exchange\n-\nlisted marketable securities, which are marked\n-\nto\n-\nmarket daily. Collateralized receivables consist primarily of customer margin loans, securities borrowed, and securities purchased under agreements to resell. As of September 30, 2025, total assets were $200.2 billion of which $198.7\n \nbillion, or 99.2%,\n \nwere considered liquid.\n \nDecisions on the allocation of capital are based upon, among other things, prudent risk management guidelines, potential liquidity and cash flow needs for current and future business activities, regulatory capital requirements, and projected profitability. Our Treasury department, Market Risk Committee, Enterprise Risk Management department and other management control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure. The objective of these policies is to support our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. Our significant capital comprises an aggregate across our many regulated subsidiaries, and in addition to supporting our current business and future expansion plans, we believe this financial strength provides our customers with a source of confidence.\n \nDaily monitoring of liquidity needs and available collateral levels is undertaken to help ensure that an appropriate liquidity cushion, in the form of cash and unpledged collateral, is maintained at all times. We actively manage our excess liquidity and maintain significant borrowing capabilities through the securities lending markets and in the form of credit facilities with banks. As a general practice, we maintain sufficient levels of cash on hand to provide us with a buffer should we need immediately available funds for any reason. In addition, pursuant to our liquidity risk management plan we perform periodic liquidity stress tests, which are designed to identify and reserve liquid assets that would be available under market or idiosyncratic stress events. Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for more than the next twelve months. \n \nAs of September 30, 2025, liability balances in connection with securities loaned and payables to customers were higher than their average monthly balances during the current quarter. Short-term borrowing balance was lower than its average monthly balance during the current quarter.\n \nCash and cash equivalents held by our non\n-\nU.S. \noperating subsidiaries\n as of September 30, 2025, were $2,073\n \nmillion ($1,513 million as of December 31, 2024). These funds are primarily intended to finance each individual operating subsidiary’s local operations, and thus would not be available to fund U.S. domestic operations unless repatriated through payment of dividends to IBG LLC. As of September 30, 2025, we had no intention to repatriate any amounts from non-U.S. operating subsidiaries. With the enactment of the U.S. \nTax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017\n, we recognized a liability for the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, in the event dividends were to be paid to the Company in the future by a non\n-\nU.S. operating subsidiaries, the Company would not be required to accrue and pay income taxes on such dividends, except for foreign taxes in the form of dividend withholding tax, and in connection with accumulated other comprehensive income/loss from currency exchange rate changes not previously taxed in the U.S., if any, imposed on the recipient of the distribution or dividend distribution tax imposed on the payor of the distribution. \n \nHistorically, our consolidated equity has consisted primarily of accumulated retained earnings, which to date have been sufficient to fund our operations and growth. Our consolidated equity increased 22% to $19.5 billion as of September 30, 2025, from $16.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. This increase is attributable to total comprehensive income, partially offset by distributions and dividends paid during the last four quarters.\n‎\n \n\n\n60\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nCash Flows \n \nThe table below presents our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods indicated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n \n2025\n \n2024\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n \n$\n 14,202\n \n$\n 6,886\nNet cash used in investing activities\n \n \n (112)\n \n \n (62)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n \n \n (786)\n \n \n (647)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n \n \n 375\n \n \n 41\nIncrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n \n$\n 13,679\n \n$\n 6,218\n \nOur cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (i.e., cash and cash equivalents that are subject to withdrawal or usage restrictions) increased by $13,679 million to $53.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n \nOperating Activities\n \nOur cash flows from operating activities are largely a reflection of the changes in customer credit and margin loan balances. We raised $14.2 billion in net cash from operating activities mainly driven by customer credit balances and securities loaned which increased $34.1 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively; partially offset by receivables from customers, securities segregated for regulatory purposes and securities borrowed, which increased by $13.2 billion, $10.8 billion, and $6.2 billion, respectively.\n \nInvesting Activities\n \nOur cash flows from investing activities are primarily related to other investments, capitalized internal software development, purchases and sales of memberships, trading rights and shares at exchanges where we trade, and strategic investments where such investments may enable us to offer better execution alternatives to our current and prospective customers, allow us to influence exchanges to provide competing products at better prices using sophisticated technology, or enable us to acquire either technology or customers faster than we could develop them on our own. We used net cash of $112 million in our investing activities primarily for purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets and other investments.\n \nFinancing Activities\n \nOur cash flows from financing activities are comprised of short-term borrowings, capital transactions, and payments made to Holdings under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Short-term borrowings from banks are part of our daily cash management in support of operating activities. Capital transactions consist primarily of quarterly dividends paid to common stockholders and related distributions paid to Holdings. We used net cash of $786 million in our financing activities, primarily for distributions to noncontrolling interests, dividends paid to common stockholders and payments made to Holdings under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n \nNine months Ended \nSeptember 30, 2024\n:\n For a discussion of changes in cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 refer to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 7, 2024. \n \nRegulatory Capital Requirements \n \nAs of September 30, 2025, all operating subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory capital requirements. For additional information regarding our regulatory capital requirements see Note 15 – ‘‘Regulatory Requirements’’ to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n \nCapital Expenditures\n \nOur capital expenditures are comprised of compensation costs of our software engineering staff for development of software for internal use and expenditures for computer, networking and communications hardware, and leasehold improvements. These expenditure items are reported as property, equipment, and intangible assets. Capital expenditures for property, equipment, and intangible assets were $45\n million\n and $34 million\n \nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. In the future, we plan to meet capital expenditure needs with cash from operations and cash on hand, as we continue our focus on technology infrastructure initiatives to further enhance our competitive position. In response to changing economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either upward or downward) to match our actual performance. If we pursue any additional strategic acquisitions, we may incur additional capital expenditures.\n \n\n\n61\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nSeasonality\n \nOur businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations, reflecting varying numbers of market participants at times during the year, varying numbers of trading days from quarter\n-\nto\n-\nquarter, and declines in trading activity due to holidays. Typical seasonal trends may be superseded by market or world events, which can have a significant impact on prices and trading volume.\n \nInflation\n \nAlthough we cannot accurately anticipate the effects of inflation on our operations, we believe that, for the past several years, inflation may have indirectly had a material impact on our results of operations. Inflation has been one of the factors driving our employee compensation and benefits expenses higher during the current period, although as a percentage of net revenues these expenses remain stable. Inflation may also be a contributing factor to general uncertainty in the markets in the foreseeable future. Statements about future inflation are subject to the risk that actual inflation and its effects may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in economic growth, impact of supply chain disruptions, unemployment and consumer demand.\n \nInvestments in U.S. Government Securities\n \nWe invest in U.S. government securities to satisfy U.S. regulatory requirements. As a broker-dealer, unlike banks, we are required to mark these investments to market even though we intend to hold them to maturity. Sudden increases (decreases) in interest rates will cause mark-to-market losses (gains) on these securities, which are recovered (eliminated) if we hold them to maturity, as currently intended. As of September 30, 2025, all of our U.S. government securities had maturities within three months. The impact of changes in interest rates is further described in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”\n \nStrategic Investments and Acquisitions\n \nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisitions. We hold strategic investments in certain electronic trading exchanges, including BOX Options Exchange, LLC and Miami International Holdings Inc. We also hold strategic investments in certain businesses, including Zero Hash Holdings Ltd. (a crypto-service provider) and Next Securities Corporation (a South Korea-based securities company).\n \nWe intend to continue making acquisitions on an opportunistic basis, generally only when the acquisition candidate will, in our opinion, enable us to offer better execution alternatives to our current and prospective customers, allow us to influence exchanges to provide competing products at better prices using sophisticated technology, or enable us to acquire either technology or customers faster than we could develop them on our own. \n \nAs of September 30, 2025, there were no definitive agreements with respect to any material acquisition.\n \nCertain Information Concerning Off\n-\nBalance\n-\nSheet Arrangements\n \nWe may be exposed to a risk of loss not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements for futures products, which represent our obligations to settle at contracted prices, and which may require us to repurchase or sell in the market at prevailing prices. Accordingly, these transactions result in off\n-\nbalance sheet risk, as our cost to liquidate such futures contracts may exceed the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.\n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. \nThese estimates and assumptions are based on judgment and the best available information at the time. \nTherefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. We believe that the critical policies listed below represent the most significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 – “Significant Accounting Policies” to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n‎\n \n\n\n62\n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n\n\n \nContingencies\n \nOur policy is to estimate and accrue for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings, to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total liability accrued with respect to litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses based on, among other factors, the progress of each case, our experience with and industry experience with similar cases and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters, particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought, or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages, we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\n \nIncome Taxes \n \nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits are based on enacted tax laws and reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Determining income tax expense requires significant judgment and estimates.\n \nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of the underlying assets and liabilities. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax\n-\nplanning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, historical results are adjusted for changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax\n-\nplanning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, three years of cumulative operating income (loss) are considered. Deferred income taxes have not been provided for U.S. tax liabilities or for additional foreign taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been indefinitely reinvested.\n \nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. For example, \non December 15, 2022, the EU formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, effective January 1, 2024, which provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) Pillar Two Framework. A significant number of other countries have either already or are expected to implement similar legislation with varying effective dates.\n We record tax liabilities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic 740 and adjust these liabilities when management’s judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are different from the current estimates of these tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information becomes available.\n \nWe recognize that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. A tax position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement.\n \nAccounting Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted\n \nFor additional information regarding FASB Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU” s) that have been issued but not yet adopted and that may impact the Company, refer to Note 2 – “Significant Accounting Policies” to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on form 10-Q.\n \n \n‎\n \n\n\n63\n \nTable of Contents"
