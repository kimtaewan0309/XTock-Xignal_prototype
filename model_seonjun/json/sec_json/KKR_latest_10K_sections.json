  "item1": "ITEM 1.  BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a leading global investment firm that offers alternative asset management as well as capital markets and insurance solutions. We aim to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and supporting growth in our portfolio companies and communities. We sponsor funds that invest in private equity, credit, and real assets and have strategic partners that manage hedge funds. Our insurance subsidiaries offer retirement, life, and reinsurance products under the management of Global Atlantic. \nOur asset management business offers a broad range of investment management services to fund investors around the world. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 770 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction value in excess of $790 billion as of December 31, 2024. Since the inception of our firm in 1976, we have expanded our investment strategies and product offerings from traditional private equity to areas such as leveraged credit, alternative credit, infrastructure, energy, real estate, growth equity (including technology, health care, and impact strategies), and core private equity. We also provide capital markets services for our firm, our portfolio companies, and third parties. Our balance sheet provides a significant source of capital for the growth and expansion of our business, which has allowed us to further align our interests with those of our investment vehicle investors. Building on these efforts and leveraging our industry expertise and intellectual capital have allowed us to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source.\nOur insurance business is operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary Global Atlantic, which is a leading retirement and life insurance company that provides a broad suite of protection, legacy and savings products, and reinsurance solutions to clients across individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic primarily offers individuals fixed-rate annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, and targeted life products through a network of banks, broker-dealers, and independent marketing organizations. Global Atlantic provides its institutional clients customized reinsurance solutions, including block, flow, and pension risk transfer reinsurance, as well as funding agreements. Global Atlantic primarily generates income by earning a spread between its investment income and the cost of policyholder benefits. As of December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic served over three and a half million policyholders.\nOur Strategic Holdings business is currently comprised of the firm’s ownership in the businesses we acquired through our participation in our core private equity strategy.  In our core private equity strategy, our objective is to acquire and manage controlling interests in operating companies, which we intend to hold over a longer period of time and that we believe have a lower anticipated risk profile than our investments in businesses acquired through our traditional private equity strategy.  As of December 31, 2024, our Strategic Holdings segment consisted of our ownership stakes in 18 companies that we acquired through our core private equity strategy. \nOur Firm\nWe seek to work proactively and collaboratively across business lines, departments, and geographies, as appropriate, to achieve what we believe are the best investment results for our clients and the firm. Through our offices around the world, we have a pre-eminent global integrated platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital, and carrying out capital markets  activities. We have multilingual and multicultural investment teams with local market knowledge and significant business, investment, and operational experience in the countries in which we invest. We believe that our global capabilities and one-firm philosophy have been critical to our success, including enabling us to raise substantial capital, capture a greater number of investment opportunities, and assist our portfolio companies in their increasing reliance on global markets and sourcing, and have also facilitated the diversification of our operations.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThough our operations span multiple continents and asset classes, our investment professionals are supported by an integrated infrastructure and operate under a common set of principles and business practices that are monitored by a variety of committees. Our investment teams operate with a single culture that rewards investment discipline, creativity, determination, and patience, and emphasizes the sharing of information, resources, expertise and best practices across offices and asset classes. When appropriate, we staff investment transactions across multiple offices and businesses in order to take advantage of the industry-specific expertise of our investment professionals, and we hold regular meetings in which investment professionals throughout our offices share their knowledge and experiences. We believe that the ability to draw on the local cultural fluency of our investment professionals while maintaining a centralized and integrated global infrastructure and strategic focus distinguishes us from other investment firms and has been a substantial contributing factor to our ability to raise funds, invest internationally, and expand our businesses.\nOur Business\nWe operate in three segments: our asset management business, our insurance business, and our strategic holdings business. \nAsset Management\nIn our asset management business, we have five business lines: (1) Private Equity, (2) Real Assets, (3) Credit and Liquid Strategies, (4) Capital Markets, and (5) Principal Activities. Information about our business lines below should be read together with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nAs an asset management firm, we earn fees, including management fees and incentive fees, and carried interest for providing investment management and other services to our investment vehicles, CLOs, managed accounts, portfolio companies, and certain operating companies, and we generate transaction fees from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income by investing our own capital alongside investors in our investment vehicles and from other assets on our balance sheet. Carried interest we receive from our funds and certain other investment vehicles entitles us to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are able to utilize a substantial and diversified capital base; an integrated global investment platform; the expertise of operating professionals, senior advisors, and other advisors; and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. These teams invest capital, a substantial portion of which is of a long duration or not subject to predetermined redemption requirements, which provides us with significant flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 93% of our AUM consists of capital that is either not subject to redemption for at least 8 years from inception or what we refer to as perpetual capital. For more information about the limitations of perpetual capital, please see \"—Risks Related to Our Business—AUM, referred to as perpetual capital, is subject to material reduction, including through withdrawal, redemption or dividends, and termination\" in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report. We believe that these aspects of our business help us continue to grow our asset management business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions.\nSince our inception, one of our fundamental investment philosophies has been to align the interests of the firm and our employees with the interests of our fund investors, portfolio companies, and other stakeholders. We achieve this by putting our own capital behind our ideas. As of December 31, 2024, we and our employees and other personnel have approximately $28.6 billion invested in or committed to our own funds and portfolio companies, including $12.2 billion of capital funded from our balance sheet, $11.0 billion of additional capital committed by our balance sheet to our investment funds and other investment vehicles, $4.2 billion funded from personal investments, and $1.2 billion of additional capital commitments from personal investments.  \n9\nTable of Contents\nPrivate Equity\nOverview\nThrough our Private Equity business line, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic non-controlling minority positions. In addition to our traditional private equity funds that invest in large and mid-sized companies, we sponsor funds that invest in core private equity and growth equity, which includes technology, health care, and impact strategies. Our Private Equity business line includes separately managed accounts that invest in multiple strategies, which may include our credit and real assets strategies, as well as our private equity strategies. These funds and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC-registered investment adviser. As of December 31, 2024, our Private Equity business line had $195.4 billion of AUM, consisting of $139.9 billion in traditional private equity, $37.4 billion in core private equity, and $18.1 billion in growth equity. \nWe are a world leader in private equity, having raised over 30 private equity funds. We invest in industry-leading franchises and attract world-class management teams. Our investment approach leverages our capital base, sourcing advantage, global network, and industry knowledge. It also leverages a sizable team of operating professionals, as well as senior advisors and other advisors, many of whom are former chief executive officers and leaders of the business community. \nOur Private Equity business line consists of the following strategies:\nTraditional Private Equity.\n  Our traditional private equity investment strategy typically seeks to engage in management buyouts, build-ups, or other investments with a view to acquire control or have significant influence. We believe that the combination of our industry knowledge, investment experience, and operational expertise provides KKR with the ability to identify and create value in investment opportunities. Through our portfolio company board oversight, we work closely and cooperatively with the management of our portfolio companies, which are assisted by having access to the resources of our global platform. Since 2022, we have offered a  middle market private equity strategy through our Ascendant fund.\nCore Private Equity.\n  Our core private equity strategy targets investments with a longer holding period and a lower anticipated risk profile than our traditional private equity investments. Our core private equity investments are made in companies that, among other things, we believe are more stable and less cyclical, and typically have lower average leverage over our holding period, than those in our traditional private equity funds.\nGrowth Equity.\n  Since 2016, we have offered growth equity funds that pursue growth equity investment opportunities in the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector in leading growth technology companies across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Israel. Through this strategy, we focus on emerging, high-growth companies and invest across a variety of sub-sectors including software, security, semiconductors, consumer electronics, internet of things (IoT), information services, business services, internet, digital media, content, and communications. \nSince 2016, we have offered growth equity funds to pursue growth equity investment opportunities in the health care sector, primarily in the United States and Europe. Our health care growth strategy targets opportunities across various health care sub-sectors, including biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, life science tools, health care providers, healthcare information technology, and other services. \nSince 2019, we have offered global impact funds, which are focused on identifying and investing behind opportunities across the Americas, Europe, and Asia where financial performance and societal impact are intrinsically aligned. Our global impact funds aim to generate private equity-like risk-adjusted returns by investing in small to medium-sized companies that contribute toward one or more of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. \n10\nTable of Contents\nPrivate Equity Assets Under Management and Select Fund Performance Information\nThe following chart presents the growth in the AUM of our Private Equity business line from December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024.\nPrivate Equity\nAssets Under Management\n(1)\n($ in billions)\n(1)\nAUM of acquired businesses are included in the years in and after the completion of the respective acquisitions or transactions, as applicable. \n11\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, relating to our current private equity and other investment vehicles reported in our Private Equity business line for which we have the ability to earn carried interest.

For further information on management fee calculations, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in our financial statements.\n(2)\nThe end date represents the end of the fund's investment period as defined in the fund's governing documents and is generally not the date upon which management fees cease to accrue. For funds that initially charge management fees on the basis of committed capital, the end date is generally the date on or after which the management fees begin to be calculated instead on the basis of invested capital and may, for certain funds, begin to be calculated using a lower rate. For further information on management fee calculations, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in our financial statements.\n(3)\nThe commitment represents the aggregate capital commitments to the fund, including capital commitments by third-party fund investors and the general partner. Foreign currency commitments have been converted into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate that prevailed on December 31, 2024.\n(4)\nThe remaining cost represents the initial investment of the general partner and limited partners, reduced for returns of capital.\n(5)\nThe \"Invested\" and \"Realized\" columns do not include the amounts of any realized investments that restored the unused capital commitments of the fund investors, if any.\n(6)\n\"Unallocated Commitments\" represent commitments received from our strategic investor partnerships that have yet to be allocated to a particular investment strategy.\nTraditional Private Equity Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2024, our traditional private equity portfolio consisted of over 140 companies with approximately $345 billion of annual revenues. These companies are headquartered in over 30 countries and operate in a variety of industries, which take advantage of our broad and deep industry and operating expertise. Many of these companies are leading franchises with global operations, strong management teams, and attractive growth prospects, which we believe will provide benefits through a broad range of business conditions.\n12\nTable of Contents\nPrivate Equity Investment Process and Fund Characteristics \nInvestment Approach\nOur approach to making private equity investments focuses on achieving multiples of invested capital and attractive risk-adjusted IRRs by selecting high-quality investments that may be made at attractive prices, applying rigorous standards of due diligence when making investment decisions, implementing strategic and operational changes that drive growth and value creation in acquired businesses, carefully monitoring investments, and making informed decisions when developing investment exit strategies.\nWe believe that we have achieved a leading position in the private equity industry by applying a disciplined investment approach and by building strong partnerships with highly motivated management teams who put their own capital at risk. When making private equity investments, we seek out strong business franchises, attractive growth prospects, leading market positions, and the ability to generate attractive returns. In our private equity funds, we do not effect transactions that are \"hostile,\" meaning a target company's board of directors makes an unfavorable recommendation with respect to the transaction or publicly opposes the consummation of the transaction.\nSourcing and Selecting Investments\nWe have access to significant opportunities for making private equity investments as a result of our sizable capital base, global platform, and relationships with leading executives from major companies, commercial and investment banks, and other investment and advisory institutions. Members of our global network contact us with new investment opportunities, including a substantial number of exclusive investment opportunities and opportunities that are made available to only a limited number of other firms. We also proactively pursue business development strategies that are designed to generate deals internally based on the depth of our industry knowledge and our reputation as a leading financial sponsor.\nDue Diligence and the Investment Decision\nWhen an investment team determines that an investment proposal is worth consideration, the proposal is formally presented to the applicable investment committee and the due diligence process commences, if appropriate. The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational improvement and value creation. When conducting due diligence, investment teams evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental, social, governance, legal, and regulatory issues in order to determine whether an investment is suitable. While the due diligence process differs depending on the type of investment we make, generally, in connection with the private equity due diligence process, investment professionals spend significant amounts of time meeting with a company's management and operating personnel, visiting plants and facilities, and where appropriate, speaking with other stakeholders interested in and impacted by the investment in order to understand the opportunities and risks associated with the proposed investment. Our investment professionals may also use the services of outside accountants, consultants, lawyers, investment banks, and industry experts as appropriate to assist them in this process. Investment committees or portfolio managers, as applicable, monitor our due diligence practices and approve an investment before it is made.\nBuilding Successful and Competitive Businesses\nPortfolio management committees are responsible for working with our investment professionals from the date on which a private equity investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored. When investing in a private equity portfolio company, we partner with management teams to execute on our investment thesis, and we rigorously track performance through regular monitoring of detailed operational and financial metrics as well as appropriate environmental, social, and governance issues. We have developed a global network of experienced managers and operating professionals who assist the private equity portfolio companies in making operational improvements and achieving growth. We augment these resources with operational guidance from operating professionals at KKR Capstone, senior advisors, other advisors and investment teams, and with \"100-Day Plans\" that focus the firm's efforts and drive our strategies. We seek to emphasize efficient capital management, top-line growth, R&D spending, geographical expansion, cost optimization, and investment for the long-term. KKR has supported and expanded the implementation of broad-based employee ownership programs to its portfolio companies with the goal of improving financial performance through broad-based employee engagement and financial inclusion.\n13\nTable of Contents\nRealizing Investments\nWe have developed substantial expertise for realizing private equity investments. From our inception through December 31, 2024, the firm has generated approximately $208.1 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our Private Equity portfolio companies in initial public offerings and secondary offerings, dividends, and sales to strategic and financial buyers. When exiting private equity investments, our objective is to structure the exit in a manner that optimizes returns for fund investors and, in the case of publicly traded companies, minimizes the impact that the exit has on the trading price of the company's securities. We believe that our ability to successfully realize investments is attributable in part to the strength and discipline of our portfolio management committees and capital markets business, as well as the firm's longstanding relationships with corporate buyers and members of the investment banking and investing communities.\nPrivate Equity Fund Structures\nThe private equity funds that we sponsor and manage typically have finite lives and investment periods. Each fund is typically organized as one or more partnerships, and each partnership is controlled by a general partner. Private equity fund investors are limited partners who agree to contribute a specified amount of capital to the fund from time to time for use in qualifying investments during the investment period, which generally lasts up to six years depending on how quickly capital is deployed. The investment period for certain funds may be terminated upon supermajority vote (based on capital commitment) of the fund's limited partners or by the fund's advisory committee. The term of our private equity funds generally last for 10 to 12 years and may last up to 15 years from the date of the fund's first or last investment, subject to a limited number of extensions with the consent of the limited partners or the applicable advisory committee. Given the length of the investment periods and terms of our private equity funds and the limited conditions under which such periods can be terminated and commitments may be withdrawn, the AUM of our private equity funds provide a long-term stable capital base.\nEach private equity fund’s general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest that allocates to it 20% of the net profits realized by the limited partners from the fund’s investments. Our private equity funds since 2012 generally have a performance hurdle which requires that we return 7%, compounded annually, to limited partners in the fund prior to receiving our 20% share of net profits realized by limited partners. Such performance hurdles are subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner after the hurdle has been reached. Our earlier private equity funds do not include a performance hurdle. The timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our private equity funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds, and is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a \"netting hole.\" See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity—Sources of Liquidity\" for a discussion of netting holes. Net realized profit or loss is not netted between or among funds. In addition, the agreements governing our private equity funds generally include a \"clawback\" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts to the fund for distribution to fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Asset Management—Revenues—Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\" and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The \"clawback\" provisions in the agreements governing our carry-paying funds may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to our funds and fund investors.\"\nWe enter into management agreements with our private equity funds pursuant to which we receive management fees in exchange for providing the funds with management and other services. Gross management fees for our private equity funds generally range from 1% to 2% of committed capital during the fund's investment period and are generally 0.75% to 1.50% of invested capital after the expiration of the fund's investment period with subsequent reductions over time, which causes the fees to be reduced as investments are liquidated. In addition, in connection with the expiration of the investment period, a private equity fund may establish a reserve on its fund investors' capital commitments on which no fee is paid unless such capital is invested. Management fees are paid by private equity fund investors, who generally contribute capital to the fund in order to allow the fund to pay the fees to us. Our private equity funds generally require that the amount of management fees be subtracted from gains allocable to fund investors before a carried interest may be paid.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe also enter into monitoring agreements with our portfolio companies pursuant to which we receive periodic monitoring fees in exchange for providing them with management, consulting, and other services, and we typically receive transaction fees for providing portfolio companies with financial, advisory, and other services in connection with specific transactions. Monitoring agreements may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control, if certain criteria are satisfied. In some cases, we may be entitled to other fees that are paid by an investment target upon closing of a transaction or when a potential investment is not consummated. Since 2014, our private equity fund agreements typically require us to share 100% of any monitoring, transaction, and other fees that are allocable to a fund (after reduction for expenses incurred allocable to a fund from unconsummated transactions) with fund investors.\nIn addition, the agreements governing our private equity funds enable investors in those funds to reduce their capital commitments available for further investments, on an investor-by-investor basis, in the event one or more \"key persons\" (for example, investment professionals who are named as \"key executives\" for certain geographically or product focused funds) cease to be actively involved in the management of the fund. While these provisions do not allow investors in our funds to withdraw capital that has been invested or cause a fund to terminate, the occurrence of a \"key person\" event could cause disruption in our business, reduce the amount of capital that we have available for future investments, and make it more challenging to raise additional capital in the future.\nBecause private equity fund investors typically are unwilling to invest their capital in a fund unless the fund's manager also invests its own capital in the fund's investments, our private equity fund documents generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to the funds. The amounts of these commitments, which are negotiated by fund investors, generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with our firm's asset allocation strategy. When investments are made, the general partner contributes capital to the fund based on its fund commitment percentage and acquires a capital interest in the investment that is not subject to a carried interest or management fees.\nReal Assets\nOverview\nThrough our Real Assets business line, we manage and sponsor a group of real assets funds and accounts that invest capital in infrastructure, real estate, or energy. These funds and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. or one of its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, our Real Assets business line had $166.0 billion of AUM, consisting of $79.9 billion in infrastructure, $79.5 billion in real estate (of which $42.5 billion is real estate credit and $37.0 billion is real estate equity), $5.2 billion in energy, and $1.4 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic investment partnership.\nInfrastructure\nWe established a dedicated infrastructure team and strategy in 2008, focused on global investment opportunities with an emphasis on investments in assets and businesses located in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \"OECD\"). In January 2020, we expanded our strategy to include investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. Our infrastructure platform seeks to achieve returns including current income through the acquisition and operational improvement of assets important to the functioning of the economy. We believe that the global infrastructure market provides an opportunity for the firm's private investment, operational improvement capabilities and stakeholder engagement. Through this platform we have made investments in sectors such as power and utilities, midstream, energy and energy transition, transportation, asset leasing, water and wastewater, telecommunications infrastructure, and social infrastructure. In 2020, we established the Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund as our first dedicated open-ended core infrastructure fund. Our diversified core infrastructure strategy seeks core infrastructure and infrastructure-related investment opportunities with a focus on investments with predominantly contracted or regulated cash flows in securities, properties, and other assets principally located in North America and Western Europe. In 2023, we established a climate-focused investment strategy, which invests in infrastructure solutions to support the global energy transition. This strategy seeks opportunities that have a combination of risk mitigation through infrastructure-like characteristics, such as hard assets and contracted cash flows. KKR Climate is a global platform that seeks to invest in companies and sectors across the entire physical economy, with a focus on OECD countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. \n15\nTable of Contents\nReal Estate\nOur real estate platform seeks to be a global solutions provider across the capital structure in the real estate industry, focusing on opportunities in the United States, Western Europe, and Asia-Pacific, including a broad range of investments such as property-level equity, debt and special situations transactions, and businesses with significant real estate holdings that can benefit from KKR’s operational expertise. We seek to partner with real estate owners, lenders, operators, and developers to provide flexible capital to respond to transaction-specific needs, including the acquisition or financing of existing assets or companies and the funding of future development or acquisition opportunities.  \nWe make real estate equity investments through opportunistic closed-end vehicles in residential and commercial assets. In addition, we have a core plus real estate strategy that seeks to pursue real estate investments through open-ended funds, primarily with the intent of having influence over the real estate assets or companies in which we make investments. We also source equity real estate investments for KKR Real Estate Select Trust Inc., a continuously offered, registered closed-end investment company, and U.S. real estate investment trust (\"KREST\"), and our Global Atlantic insurance companies. Our real estate credit platform provides capital solutions for real estate transactions with a focus on commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\"), whole loans and subordinated debt. These strategies are deployed in a variety of ways, including through Global Atlantic, KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. (NYSE: KREF), a publicly listed U.S. real estate investment trust (\"KREF\"), and our real estate credit funds which focus on commercial real estate lending and the risk retention tranches of CMBS. Our global presence is strengthened by KJRM, one of the largest Japanese real estate asset managers in Japan. KJRM manages diversified real estate assets, including retail, office, and mixed used properties through two Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed real estate investment trusts: Japan Metropolitan Fund Investment Corporation and Industrial & Infrastructure Fund Investment Corporation. \nEnergy\nOur primary platform for pursuing upstream oil and natural gas opportunities is through Crescent Energy Company (“Crescent”), a publicly listed energy company (NYSE: CRGY), which we manage. Crescent is a U.S. independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition, development, and operation of oil and natural gas properties.   \n16\nTable of Contents\nReal Assets Under Management and Select Fund Performance Information\nThe following chart presents the growth in the AUM of our Real Assets business line from December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024.\nReal Assets\nAssets Under Management \n(1)\n($ in billions)\n \n(1)\nAUM of acquired businesses are included in the years on and after the completion of the respective acquisitions or transactions, as applicable. \n17\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, relating to our current real asset and other investment vehicles reported in our Real Assets business line for which we have the ability to earn carried interest.

For funds that initially charge management fees on the basis of committed capital, the end date is generally the date on or after which the management fees begin to be calculated instead on the basis of invested capital and may, for certain funds, begin to be calculated using a lower rate.

This vehicle's investment period start date and end date will be determined based upon the date of the close of its first investment.\n(7)\n\"Unallocated Commitments\" represent commitments received from our strategic investor partnerships that have yet to be allocated to a particular investment strategy.\n18\nTable of Contents\nReal Asset Investment Process and Fund Characteristics\nReal Asset Investment Process\nOur infrastructure, real estate, and energy investment vehicles have a similar investment process as that described under \"—Private Equity Investment Process and Fund Characteristics.\" Investment teams for a particular real asset strategy formally present potential investments to the applicable strategy oriented investment committee or the portfolio manager, as applicable, which monitors our due diligence practices and approves an investment before it is made. Our Real Asset strategies also typically have a portfolio management team that works with our investment professionals from the date on which an investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored. In addition to leveraging the resources of the firm, our infrastructure, real estate, and energy investment teams typically partner with technical experts and operators to manage our Real Asset investments.\nReal Asset Fund Structures\nOur traditional infrastructure and real estate funds generally have investment periods of up to 6 years and generally have a fund term of up to 13 years. Management fees for such funds generally range from 0.75% to 1.5% on committed capital, invested capital, or net asset value during the investment period and on invested capital or net asset value for investments thereafter, subject to certain adjustments. These funds generally have performance hurdles of 8% to 10% subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner after the hurdle has been reached. Thereafter, the general partners of such funds generally share in 10% to 20% of net profits realized by limited partners.\nOur core real estate and infrastructure funds are open-ended and do not have a fixed termination date. They also do not have a specified termination date for making investments. Management fees for such funds generally range from 0.5% to 1.2% of net asset value, subject to certain adjustments. The general partners of such funds are also entitled to incentive fees ranging generally from 5% to 10% of cash flow or net asset value appreciation, subject to performance hurdles. We also provide investment management services to the publicly available entities in our real assets strategy, including KREF, KREST, and Crescent. These services are pursuant to a management agreement with specific KKR subsidiaries, which provide for the payment of management fees, generally ranging from 1.25% to 1.50% of their equity value or similar metric, as well as incentive fees.\nPrivate Equity and Real Asset Historical Performance\nWe take a long-term approach to Private Equity and Real Assets investing and measure the success of our investments over a period of years rather than months. Given the duration of these investments, the firm focuses on realized multiples of invested capital and internal rates of return (\"IRRs\") when deploying capital in these transactions. We have approximately doubled the value of capital from our inception in 1976 to December 31, 2024 that has been invested by our Private Equity and Real Assets investment funds, turning $203.4 billion of total invested capital into $381.9 billion of total value over that period. \nFrom our inception in 1976 through December 31, 2024, our Private Equity and Real Assets investment funds with at least 24 months of investment activity generated a cumulative gross IRR of 25.5%, compared to the 12.2% and 9.5% gross IRR achieved by the S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index, respectively, over the same period, despite the cyclical and sometimes challenging environments in which we have operated. The S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index are unmanaged indices and their returns assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect any fees or expenses. Our past performance, however, may not be representative of performance in any period other than the period discussed above and is not a guarantee of future results. For additional information regarding impact of market conditions on the value and performance of our investments, see our \"Risk Factors.\"\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, relating to the historical performance of certain of our Private Equity and Real Assets investment vehicles since inception, which we believe illustrates the benefits of our investment approach. This data does not reflect additional capital raised since December 31, 2024, or acquisitions or disposals of investments, changes in investment values, or distributions occurring after that date. The information presented below is not intended to be representative of any past or future performance for any particular period other than the period presented below.

(Guernsey) L.P. (formerly known as KKR Private Equity Investors, L.P.) on October 1, 2009.\n(2)\nWhere commitments are not U.S. dollar-denominated, such amounts have been converted into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate prevailing on December 31, 2024.  \n20\nTable of Contents\n(3)\nThe gross IRR, net IRR and gross multiple of invested capital are calculated for our investment funds that made their first investment at least 24 months prior to December 31, 2024. We therefore have not calculated gross IRRs, net IRRs, and gross multiples of invested capital with respect to these funds. \n(4)\nAn investment is considered realized when it has been disposed of or has otherwise generated disposition proceeds or current income that has been distributed by the relevant fund. \n(5)\nIRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period. Net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses. Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses. \nThe gross multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the fund. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees or organizational expenses.\nKKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds may utilize third-party financing facilities to provide liquidity to such funds. The above net and gross IRRs are calculated from the time capital contributions are due from fund investors to the time fund investors receive a related distribution from the fund, and the use of such financing facilities generally decreases the amount of time that would otherwise be used to calculate IRRs, which tends to increase IRRs when fair value grows over time and decrease IRRs when fair value decreases over time. KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds also generally provide in certain circumstances, which vary depending on the relevant fund documents, for a portion of capital returned to investors to be restored to unused commitments as recycled capital. For KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds that have a preferred return, we take into account recycled capital in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital because the calculation of the preferred return includes the effect of recycled capital. For KKR's Private Equity and Real Assets funds that do not have a preferred return, we do not take recycled capital into account in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital. The inclusion of recycled capital generally causes invested and realized amounts to be higher and IRRs and multiples of invested capital to be lower than had recycled capital not been included. The inclusion of recycled capital would reduce the composite net IRR of all Included Funds by 0.1% and the composite net IRR of all Legacy Funds by 0.5% and would reduce the composite multiple of invested capital of Included Funds by less than 0.1 and the composite multiple of invested capital of Legacy Funds by 0.4. \nFor more information, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Future results of our investments may be different than, and may not achieve the levels of, any of our historical returns.\"\nCredit and Liquid Strategies\nOverview\nThrough our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line, we report our credit and hedge funds platforms on a combined basis. As of December 31, 2024, our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line had $276.2 billion of AUM, comprised of $130.2 billion of assets managed in our leveraged credit strategies, $67.7 billion of assets in asset-based finance, $40.9 billion in direct lending, $7.7 billion of assets managed in our SIG strategy, and $29.7 billion of assets managed through our hedge fund platform, which we refer to as the liquid strategies component of our credit and liquid strategies business. Asset-based finance and direct lending together represent our private credit strategy. We manage $142.3 billion of credit investments for our Global Atlantic insurance companies. Our BDCs have approximately $15.5 billion in assets under management, which is reflected in the AUM of our credit strategies above. We report all of the assets under management of our BDCs in our AUM, but we report only a pro rata portion of the assets under management of our hedge fund partnerships based on our percentage ownership in them.\nCredit\nOur credit platform invests capital in a broad range of corporate debt and collateral-backed investments across asset classes and capital structures. Our credit strategies are primarily managed by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, which is an SEC-registered investment adviser, KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) Unlimited Company, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”), KKR Credit Advisors (EMEA) LLP, which is regulated by the United Kingdom (\"UK\") Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\"), and KKR Credit Advisors (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., which is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and an SEC-registered investment adviser.  We also jointly own with a third party FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, an  investment adviser registered with the SEC that provides investment advisory services to certain registered investment companies, including FS KKR Capital Corp. (NYSE: FSK), a publicly listed BDC, KKR FS Income Trust, a privately-offered BDC and KKR FS Income Trust Select, a privately-offered BDC.  \nOur hedge funds platform consists of strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake. Our hedge fund partnerships offer a range of alternative investment strategies, including long/short equity, hedge fund-of-funds, and energy credit investments.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur credit business pursues a variety of investment strategies in leveraged credit and alternative credit.\nLeveraged Credit.\n Our leveraged credit strategies seek to primarily invest in assets such as leveraged loans (including revolving credit facilities), CLOs, high yield bonds, and structured credit (including CLOs and asset-backed securities). Within leveraged credit, we manage both single-asset class and multi-asset class pools of capital. Our opportunistic credit strategy seeks to deploy capital across investment themes that seek to take advantage of credit market dislocations and relative value opportunities spanning, asset types and liquidity profiles. Our multi-asset credit strategy seeks to dynamically allocate across public liquid credit asset types in a broadly diversified strategy.\nAlternative Credit.\n  Our alternative credit strategy consists of our (i) private credit strategies and (ii) investments overseen by our credit platform’s strategic investments group (“SIG”):\n•\nPrivate Credit.\n Our private credit strategies focus on privately or directly originated and negotiated transactions. These strategies include direct lending typically in the senior part of a company’s capital structure, junior mezzanine debt, and asset-based finance. Through our direct lending strategy, we seek to make investments in primarily senior debt financings for middle-market companies. Through our junior mezzanine debt strategy, investments typically consist of subordinated debt, which generates a current yield, coupled with marginal equity exposure for additional upside potential. Our asset-based finance strategy focuses on multi-sector investments secured by portfolios of financial assets, including loans backed by hard assets across the risk-return spectrum. We also own 19 captive origination platforms that are dedicated to sourcing and structuring asset-based financial assets, hard assets, and contractual cash flows.\n•\nStrategic Investments Group.\n This strategy seeks to provide strategic capital solutions to high quality, mid-to-large cap companies and assets. The strategy pursues investment capital solutions in corporate credit where we believe market volatility or other investment themes have created the opportunity to invest opportunistically across the capital structure and through market cycles to generate outsized returns, and which may include investment terms intended to offer various levels of downside-protection. These investment opportunities may include debt (senior and junior), preferred equity, convertible debt, and structured equity. These investments may include non-control-oriented opportunities, a variety of capital solutions for third-party investment vehicles, balance sheet optimization capital solutions, strategic partner capital, and other event-driven investments in debt or equity.\nHedge Fund Platform\nOur hedge fund platform consists of strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake. This principally consists of a 39.6% interest in Marshall Wace LLP (together with its affiliates, \"Marshall Wace\"), a global alternative investment manager specializing in long/short equity products.  \n22\nTable of Contents\nCredit and Liquid Strategies Assets Under Management and Select Fund Performance Information\nThe following chart presents the growth in the AUM of our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line from December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024.\nCredit and Liquid Strategies\nAssets Under Management \n(1) \n($ in billions)\n(1)\nAUM of acquired businesses and pro rata AUM of hedge fund partnerships in which KKR has made an investment are included in the years on and after the completion of the respective acquisitions or transactions, as applicable. \n23\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, relating to our current credit investment vehicles reported in our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line for which we have the ability to earn carried interest.

The S&P/LSTA Loan Index is a daily tradable index for the U.S. loan market that seeks to mirror the market-weighted performance of the largest institutional loans that meet certain criteria. The BoAML HY Master II Index is an index for high-yield corporate bonds. It is designed to measure the broad high-yield market, including lower-rated securities. The CS Inst West European Leveraged Loan Index contains only institutional loan facilities priced above 90, excluding TL and TLa facilities and loans rated CC, C or are in default. The S&P European Leveraged Loan Index reflects the market-weighted performance of institutional leveraged loan portfolios investing in European credits. While the returns of our leveraged credit strategies reflect the reinvestment of income and dividends, none of the indices presented in the chart above reflect such reinvestment, which has the effect of increasing the reported relative performance of these strategies as compared to the indices. Furthermore, these indices are not subject to management fees, incentive allocations, or expenses.\n(2)\nPerformance is based on a blended composite of Bank Loans, High Yield, and Structured Credit strategy accounts. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Multi-Asset Credit Composite strategy is based on 65% S&P/LSTA Loan Index and 35% BoAML HY Master II Index to May 2022, and 50% S&P/LSTA Loan Index, 50% BoAML HY Master II Index, from June 2022.\n(3)\nThe Opportunistic Credit strategy invests in high-yield securities and corporate loans with no preset allocation. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Opportunistic Credit strategy presented herein is based on 50% S&P/LSTA Loan Index and 50% BoAML HY Master II Index. Funds within this strategy may utilize third-party financing facilities to enhance investment returns. In cases where financing facilities are used, the amounts drawn on the facility are deducted from the assets of the fund in the calculation of net asset value, which tends to increase returns when net asset value grows over time and decrease returns when net asset value decreases over time.\n(4)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Bank Loans strategy is based on the S&P/LSTA Loan Index.\n(5)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in high-yield securities. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the High Yield strategy is based on the BoAML HY Master II Index.\n(6)\nThe returns presented are calculated based on local currency. \n(7)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in higher quality leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the European Leveraged Loans strategy is based on the CS Inst West European Leveraged Loan Index.\n(8)\nPerformance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in European institutional leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the European Credit Opportunities strategy is based on the S&P European Leveraged Loans (All Loans) Index. \n25\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents information regarding our alternative credit investment funds where investors have capital commitments from inception to December 31, 2024.

The use of such financing facilities generally decreases the amount of invested capital that would otherwise be used to calculate IRRs, which tends to increase IRRs when fair value grows over time and decrease IRRs when fair value decreases over time. IRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period and are calculated taking into account recycled capital. Net IRRs presented are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses.  Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses.\n(3)\nThe multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the investors. The use of financing facilities generally decreases the amount of invested capital that would otherwise be used to calculate multiples of invested capital, which tends to increase multiples when fair value grows over time and decrease multiples when fair value decreases over time. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of any realized and unrealized returns on a fund's investments to the fund's general partner pursuant to a carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees and are calculated without taking into account recycled capital. \nFor additional information regarding impact of market conditions on the value and performance of our investments, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult market and economic conditions can, and periodically do, materially adversely affect KKR\" and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Future results of our investments may be different than, and may not achieve the levels of, any of our historical returns.\"\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2024, based on the investment funds or other investment vehicles or accounts offered by our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line.

We report all of the assets under management of these BDCs in our AUM and FPAUM.\nCredit and Liquid Strategies Investment Process and Fund Characteristics\nInvestment Approach\nOur approach to making credit investments focuses on creating investment portfolios that seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by selecting investments that may be made at attractive prices, subjecting investments to regular monitoring and oversight, and, for more liquid investments, making buy and sell decisions based on relative value parameters. The firm employs both \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" analyses when making investments. Our top-down analysis involves, as appropriate, a macro analysis of relative asset valuations, long-term industry trends, business cycles, regulatory trends, interest rate expectations, credit fundamentals and technical factors to target specific industry sectors, and asset classes in which to invest. From a bottom-up perspective, our investment decision is predicated on an investment thesis that is developed using our proprietary resources and knowledge and due diligence.\nSourcing and Selecting Investments\nWe source our credit investment opportunities through a variety of channels, including internal deal generation strategies and the firm's global network of contacts at major companies, corporate executives, commercial and investment banks, financial intermediaries, other private equity sponsors, and other investment and advisory institutions. We are also provided with opportunities to invest, in certain strategies where appropriate, in the securities of KKR's private equity portfolio companies, though there are limitations across the platform on the availability and maximum size of such KKR-affiliated investments.\n27\nTable of Contents\nDue Diligence and the Investment Decision\nOnce a potential credit investment has been identified, our investment professionals screen the opportunity and make a preliminary determination concerning whether we should proceed with further diligence. When evaluating the suitability of an investment for our credit investment vehicles, we typically employ a relative value framework and subject the investment to due diligence. This review considers many factors including, as appropriate, expected returns, capital structure, credit ratings, historical and projected financial data, the issuer's competitive position, the quality and track record of the issuer's management team, margin stability, and industry and company trends. Investment professionals use the services of outside advisors and industry experts as appropriate to assist them in the due diligence process and, when relevant and permitted, leverage the knowledge and experience of our Private Equity and Real Assets investment professionals. Strategy-specific investment committees monitor our due diligence practices.\nMonitoring Investments\nWe monitor our portfolios of investments using, as applicable, daily, quarterly, and annual analyses. Daily analyses include morning market meetings, industry and company pricing runs, industry and company reports, and discussions with the firm's Private Equity, Real Assets and Capital Markets investment professionals on an as-needed basis. Quarterly analyses include the preparation of quarterly operating results, reconciliations of actual results to projections, and updates to financial models (baseline and stress cases). Annual analyses involve conducting internal audits and testing compliance with monitoring and documentation requirements.\nCredit Investment Vehicles and Fund Structures\nWe pursue leveraged credit and alternative credit investments across a range of investment vehicles, including investment funds and separately managed accounts, for which we receive a fee and in certain cases an incentive fee or carried interest.\nWe also manage structured credit investment vehicles in the form of CLOs that hold leveraged loans, high-yield bonds or a combination of both. CLOs are typically structured as special purpose investment vehicles that acquire, monitor and, to varying degrees, manage a pool of credit assets. CLOs generally serve as long-term financing for leveraged credit investments and as a way to reduce refinancing risk, reduce maturity risk and secure a fixed cost of funds over an underlying market interest rate. We typically receive a fee for managing CLOs.\nWe also serve as the investment adviser to investment companies registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"Investment Company Act,\" and such registered investment companies, \"RICs\"), including KKR Income Opportunities Fund (NYSE: KIO), KKR Credit Opportunities Portfolio (an interval fund), as well as FS KKR Capital Corp. (NYSE: FSK), KKR FS Income Trust (a privately offered BDC), and KKR FS Income Trust Select (a privately offered BDC)  through our joint ownership of their investment adviser. We also serve as the investment adviser to other investment vehicles that are available to public investors, including KKR Credit Income Fund (an Australian listed investment trust; ASX: KKC).  The management fees we are paid for managing RICs are generally subject to contractual rights that require their board of directors to provide prior notice in order to terminate our investment management services\n. \n28\nTable of Contents\nCapital Markets\nOur Capital Markets business line is comprised of our global capital markets business, which is integrated with KKR’s asset management business line, and serves our firm, including our insurance business, our portfolio companies, and third-party customers by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or companies seeking financing. These services include arranging debt and equity financing, placing and underwriting securities offerings, and providing other types of capital markets services that result in the firm receiving fees, including underwriting, placement, transaction and syndication fees, commissions, underwriting discounts, interest payments and other compensation, which may be payable in cash or securities, in respect of the activities described above. Third-party clients of our capital markets business include multi-national corporations, public and private companies, financial sponsors, mutual funds, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and hedge funds globally. Our capital markets business provides these clients with differentiated access to capital through our distribution platform.\nOur capital markets business underwrites credit facilities and arranges loan syndications and participations. When we are sole or lead arrangers of a credit facility, we may advance amounts to the borrower on behalf of other lenders, subject to repayment. When we underwrite an offering of securities on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities and generate revenue by purchasing the securities at a discount or for a fee. When we act in an agency capacity or best efforts basis, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing securities with capital markets investors. We may also provide issuers with capital markets advice on capital structuring, access to markets, marketing considerations, securities pricing, and other aspects of capital markets transactions in exchange for a fee. Our capital markets business also provides syndication services in respect of co-investments in transactions participated in by KKR, our funds, Global Atlantic, and third-party clients, which may entitle the firm to receive syndication fees, management fees, and/or a carried interest.\nThe capital markets business has a global footprint, with local presence and licenses to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. Our flagship capital markets subsidiaries include KKR Capital Markets LLC, which is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of FINRA, KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, KKR Capital Markets Partners LLP, which is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, KKR Capital Markets Japan Limited, a Type I and Type II Financial Instruments Business Operator (broker dealer) under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan, KKR Capital Markets Asia Limited, a Hong Kong licensed asset manager and broker-dealer licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong to carry on dealing in securities, advising on securities and asset management regulated activities, and KKR Capital Markets Asia II Limited, a Hong Kong licensed broker-dealer licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong to carry on dealing in securities and advising on securities. \nPrincipal Activities\nThrough our Principal Activities business line, we manage the firm’s own assets on our firm’s balance sheet and deploy capital to support and grow our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines. \nTypically, the funds in our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines contractually require us, as general partner of the funds, to make sizable capital commitments. We believe making general partner commitments assists us in raising new funds from limited partners by demonstrating our conviction in a given fund’s strategy. Our commitments to fund capital also occurs where we are the holder of the subordinated notes or the equity tranche of investment vehicles that we sponsor, including structured transactions. We also use our balance sheet to bridge investment activity during fundraising and, for example, by funding investments for new funds. We also use our own capital to bridge capital selectively for our funds’ investments or finance strategic transactions, although the financial results of an acquired business may be reported in our other business lines.\nOur Principal Activities business line also provides the required capital to fund the various commitments of our Capital Markets business line when underwriting or syndicating securities, or when providing term loan commitments for transactions involving our portfolio companies and for third parties. Our Principal Activities business line also holds assets that are utilized to satisfy regulatory requirements for our Capital Markets business line and risk retention requirements for certain investment vehicles.\nWe also make opportunistic investments through our Principal Activities business line, which include co-investments alongside our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies funds, as well as Principal Activities investments that do not involve our Private Equity, Real Assets, or Credit and Liquid Strategies funds.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe endeavor to use our balance sheet strategically and opportunistically to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on equity in a manner that is consistent with our fiduciary duties, in compliance with applicable laws, and consistent with our one-firm approach.\nPrior to the creation of the Strategic Holdings segment, effective January 2, 2024, the periodic financial operating results of the firm's participation in the core private equity strategy were reported as part of this Principal Activities business line within the Asset Management segment.  Starting with the first quarter of 2024 , those financial operating results are not reflected in the Asset Management segment. See \"Strategic Holdings\" for further information regarding our participation in the core private equity strategy. \nThe chart below presents the holdings of our Principal Activities business line by asset class as of December 31, 2024, excluding our ownership of businesses reported through our Strategic Holdings segment.  \nHoldings by Asset Class \n(1)\n(1)\nGeneral partner commitments to our funds are included in the various asset classes shown above. Assets and revenues of other asset managers with which KKR has formed strategic partnerships where KKR does not hold more than 50% ownership interest are not included in our Principal Activities business line but are reported in the financial results of our other business lines. \n30\nTable of Contents\nFundraising\nWe have dedicated employees on our KKR Global Client Solutions team who are responsible for raising capital for our asset management business globally across products, expanding our investment advisory relationships across asset classes and across types of investors in our investment vehicles, developing products to meet our investors' needs, and servicing our investors and products. We also provide customized solutions for our investors seeking diversified portfolios of investment funds and direct co-investments in privately negotiated investments. \nAs of December 31, 2024 we had over 2,200 investors and platforms who invest in and support our investment vehicles, in addition to a significant underlying individual investor base across asset classes. Our institutional investor base in our investment vehicles is diversified by type, including public and corporate pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, and investment managers. Our private wealth capital comes from multiple sources, including directly from family offices, through our K-Series vehicles and, in the future, via our announced strategic partnership with Capital Group. Our institutional and private wealth capital is sourced from investors spanning over 65 countries.\nThe K-Series suite of vehicles for individual private wealth investors are distributed to the qualified investors of private banks, broker dealers, and independent investment advisors or through third-party managed vehicles sponsored by distributors or third-party feeder providers. Unlike our traditional fund structures, these investments do not have fixed termination dates and provide certain limited opportunities for liquidity. We have K-Series vehicles that operate or invest in private equity companies, infrastructure assets, credit investments, and real estate. We provide our services pursuant to management agreements with these vehicles. Such K-Series' investment vehicles' governing documents provide for management fees, fee related performance fees, and carried interest. As of December 31, 2024, total K-Series AUM was $16.4 billion.\n31\nTable of Contents\nInsurance\nOur insurance business is operated by Global Atlantic, which operates as a separate business with its existing brands and management team. KKR acquired a majority controlling interest in Global Atlantic on February 1, 2021, and the remainder of Global Atlantic on January 2, 2024. Since the first quarter of 2021, we have presented Global Atlantic's financial results as a separate reportable segment.\nGlobal Atlantic is a leading retirement and life insurance company that provides a broad suite of protection, legacy, and savings products to customers and reinsurance solutions to clients across individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic focuses on target markets that it believes support issuing products that have attractive risk and return characteristics. These markets allow Global Atlantic to leverage its strength in distribution and to deploy shareholder capital opportunistically across various market environments. \nGlobal Atlantic offers individual customers fixed-rate annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, and preneed life insurance products primarily through a network of banks, broker-dealers, and independent marketing organizations. Global Atlantic provides its institutional clients customized reinsurance solutions, including block, flow, and pension risk transfer (\"PRT\") transactions, as well as funding agreements. Global Atlantic’s assets generally increase when individual market sales and reinsurance transactions exceed run-off of in-force policies. Global Atlantic primarily generates income by earning a spread on assets under management, as the difference between its net investment income and the cost of policyholder benefits. Global Atlantic also earns fees paid by policyholders on certain types of contracts and fees paid by third-party investors, which are reported in the asset management segment. As of December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic served over three and a half million policyholders. \nGlobal Atlantic operates in the following two complementary markets: individual and institutional.\nIndividual Markets.\n Global Atlantic seeks to reach individuals in the United States who are planning for, or are already in, retirement. Global Atlantic’s annuity products are distributed primarily through a network of distribution partners, including over 200 banks and broker-dealers and over 200 independent marketing organizations. Global Atlantic generated $15.4 billion of sales from retirement and preneed products for the year ended December 31, 2024. Global Atlantic's preneed life insurance products are distributed primarily through approximately 2,400 funeral homes. \n•\nFixed-Rate and Fixed-Indexed Annuities.\n With an annuity product, the policyholder provides Global Atlantic cash, referred to as a premium, in exchange for earning interest on a tax deferred basis and the ability based on the contract terms to take lump sum or periodic withdrawals of their account value. Global Atlantic’s annuity products typically also offer a death benefit that guarantees the full account value for the beneficiaries in the event of the death of the policyholder. Fixed-rate annuities offer policyholders tax-deferred savings accumulation and income based on a fixed rate that may be guaranteed for a period of time. Fixed-indexed annuities allow the policyholder to elect strategies where interest is credited based on the performance of a market index. This selection allows the policyholder to participate in the upside performance of the selected index, subject to limits and protection from downside market risks. Global Atlantic primarily generates income from annuity products by earning a spread between net investment income and the cost of providing benefits under the annuity contract.\n•\nLife Products.\n Global Atlantic’s targeted product in this category is preneed life insurance. For preneed products, the policyholder generally purchases the preneed product along with a contract with a funeral home that guarantees the policyholder a pre-planned funeral, funded by proceeds from the preneed policy. Global Atlantic primarily generates income from life products from premiums, fees, and investment income, net of the cost of policyholder benefits. Global Atlantic does not underwrite new indexed universal life products, but previously underwritten indexed universal life policies remain in-force.\n \n32\nTable of Contents\nInstitutional Markets.\n Global Atlantic provides its institutional clients customized reinsurance solutions to assist them in meeting their strategic, risk management, and capital goals. In general, by reinsuring policies, the institutional client reduces or releases capital that it held for the reinsured business and may use such capital for its other business goals. Global Atlantic's institutional solutions include block, flow, PRT, and funding agreements. Global Atlantic’s reinsurance solutions are offered through a client coverage effort focused on domestic and international retirement and life companies. Since Global Atlantic’s founding, it has closed multiple reinsurance transactions, including block, flow, and PRT, with 32 clients representing a total of $162.6 billion of assets as of December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic generated $11.9 billion and $1.0 billion of flow and PRT reinsurance production, respectively. To further scale its institutional markets business, Global Atlantic sponsors co-investment vehicles (the \"Ivy and other co-investment vehicles\") to participate alongside Global Atlantic in certain qualifying reinsurance transactions. Global Atlantic also participates in the funding agreement market, including through membership in Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and as a provider of funding agreements in connection with a funding agreement backed notes (\"FABN\") program established in 2021. Global Atlantic primarily generates income from the Institutional Markets channel by earning a spread between net investment income earned on the net assets assumed and the cost of providing benefits to policyholders.\n•\nBlock Reinsurance.\n Block reinsurance is a transaction in which an insurance company divests a block of insurance policies to Global Atlantic in exchange for Global Atlantic’s obligation to pay a specified portion of future insurance claims arising from that block. Global Atlantic operates in the block reinsurance market by offering solutions to its clients across various sizes of transactions and across multiple product types, including both retirement and life products. In block reinsurance transactions, Global Atlantic’s insurance company subsidiaries assume the obligation to pay the policy benefits from the cedant in exchange for a transfer of assets.\n•\nFlow Reinsurance.\n Flow reinsurance is an agreement in which an insurance company writes new retail policies and shares an economic portion of such newly issued policies with an insurance company subsidiary of Global Atlantic, as its reinsurer, on an ongoing basis. Global Atlantic operates in flow reinsurance by partnering with insurance companies that sell retirement products, such as multi-year guaranteed annuities or single premium immediate annuities. Global Atlantic seeks to ensure that its partnerships generate profitable growth, repricing flow reinsurance products as market conditions evolve.\n•\nPRT Transactions.\n PRT is a transaction in which a pension plan sponsor, such as a corporation, transfers the risk associated with the pension plan’s liabilities to an insurance company. Global Atlantic directly underwrites PRT transactions and also operates in the PRT market indirectly through reinsurance relationships with insurance company clients that directly underwrite and assume corporate pension liabilities. Insurance company subsidiaries of Global Atlantic act as the reinsurer in respect of these indirect PRT transactions, and Global Atlantic’s clients are the ceding companies. Global Atlantic’s clients seek PRT transactions to manage risk and to reduce capital requirements. \n•\nFunding Agreements.\n Funding agreements, including those issued in connection with a FABN program, are a deposit-type contract issued by Global Atlantic’s insurance company subsidiaries. In general, a funding agreement provides its holder with a guaranteed return of principal and periodic interest payments. As of December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic had $5.3 billion of funding agreements outstanding under the FABN program.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents Global Atlantic’s new business volumes by business and product for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n($ in millions)\nIndividual Channel:\nFixed-Rate Annuities\n$\n7,777 \n$\n7,509 \nFixed-Indexed Annuities\n7,025 \n3,606 \nVariable Annuities\n19 \n23 \nTotal Retirement Products\n(1)\n$\n14,821\n \n$\n11,138\n \nLife Insurance Products\n(2)\n$\n— \n$\n9 \nPreneed Life\n$\n605 \n$\n299 \nInstitutional Channel:\nBlock\n$\n11,881 \n$\n10,854 \nFlow\n11,865 \n9,787 \nPension Risk Transfer\n996 \n1,471 \nFunding Agreements\n(3)\n2,373 \n510 \nTotal Institutional Channel\n(4)(5)\n$\n27,115\n \n$\n22,622\n \n(1)\nNew business volumes in individual markets are referred to as sales. In Global Atlantic's individual market channel, sales of annuities include all money paid into new and existing contracts. Individual market channel sales of life insurance products are based on commissionable premium and individual market channel sales for preneed life are based on the face amount of insurance. Life insurance product sales do not include the recurring premiums that policyholders may pay over time. \n(2)\nEffective July 1, 2023, Global Atlantic no longer underwrites new indexed universal life products. Indexed universal life policies written prior to this date remain effective.\n(3)\nFunding agreements new business volumes represent funding agreements issued in connection with the FABN and FHLB funding agreements programs.\n(4)\nBlock reinsurance transactions may be episodic and volumes may fluctuate. Similarly, funding agreements issued in the FABN program are subject to capital markets conditions and volumes may fluctuate. Flow and pension risk transfer new business volumes typically occur throughout the year. See “—Risks Related to Our Business—Many parts of our earnings and cash flow are highly variable due to the nature of our business.”\n(5)\nNew business volumes from Global Atlantic’s institutional market channel are based on the assets assumed, net of any ceding commission, and are gross of any retrocessions to investment vehicles that participate in qualifying reinsurance transactions sourced by Global Atlantic and to other third party reinsurers.\nGlobal Atlantic seeks to have a diversified set of policy liabilities in order to manage adverse developments across liability types. As of December 31, 2024, 41% of its reserves were in its individual markets and 59% were in its institutional markets.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe table below represents a breakdown of Global Atlantic’s policy liabilities by business and product type as of December 31, 2024, separated by reserves originated through its individual and institutional markets.\nReserves as of December 31, 2024\nIndividual Market\nInstitutional Market\n(4)\nTotal\nCeded\nTotal, net\nPercentage of Total\n($ in thousands, except percentages, if applicable)\nFixed-Rate Annuities\n(1)\n$\n28,585,274 \n$\n36,642,286 \n$\n65,227,560 \n$\n(10,306,503)\n$\n54,921,057 \n34.5 \n%\nFixed-Indexed Annuities\n(1)\n28,985,285 \n11,107,669 \n40,092,954 \n(4,461,289)\n35,631,665 \n21.2 \n%\nPayout Annuities\n(1)\n568,014 \n22,248,618 \n22,816,632 \n(11,765,332)\n11,051,300 \n12.1 \n%\nVariable Annuities\n2,251,687 \n5,396,401 \n7,648,088 \n(2,141,907)\n5,506,181 \n4.0 \n%\nInterest Sensitive Life\n(1)\n13,721,883 \n18,996,534 \n32,718,417 \n(8,957,109)\n23,761,308 \n17.3 \n%\nOther Life Insurance\n(2)\n3,723,878 \n4,137,697 \n7,861,575 \n(2,898,149)\n4,963,426 \n4.2 \n%\nFunding Agreements\n(3)\n— \n7,158,103 \n7,158,103 \n— \n7,158,103 \n3.8 \n%\nClosed Block and Other Corporate Products\n— \n1,035,059 \n1,035,059 \n(974,331)\n60,728 \n0.5 \n%\nOther\n(5)\n— \n4,628,038 \n4,628,038 \n(3,645,319)\n982,719 \n2.4 \n%\nTotal Reserves\n$\n77,836,021\n \n$\n111,350,405\n \n$\n189,186,426\n \n$\n(45,149,939)\n$\n144,036,487\n \n100.0\n \n%\nTotal General Account\n$\n75,833,868 \n$\n109,371,498 \n$\n185,205,366 \n$\n(45,149,939)\n$\n140,055,427 \n97.9 \n%\nTotal Separate Account\n2,002,153 \n1,978,907 \n3,981,060 \n— \n3,981,060 \n2.1 \n%\nTotal Reserves\n$\n77,836,021\n \n$\n111,350,405\n \n$\n189,186,426\n \n$\n(45,149,939)\n$\n144,036,487\n \n100.0\n \n%\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024, 82% of the account value in Global Atlantic's general account associated with its fixed-rate and fixed-indexed annuity products, and 42% of account value in its general account associated with universal life products, was protected by surrender charges.\n(2)\n\"Other life products” includes universal life, term, and whole life insurance products.\n(3)\n\"Funding agreements” includes funding agreements associated with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and under Global Atlantic's funding-agreement backed-notes program.\n(4)\nInstitutional market reserves are sourced using customized reinsurance solutions such as block, flow, and PRT. As of December 31, 2024, reserves sourced through block, flow, and PRT transactions were $63.3 billion, $31.6 billion, and $6.2 billion, respectively.\n(5)\n“Other” includes long-term care insurance where Global Atlantic has ceded mortality and morbidity risk to a third-party reinsurance company.\nUnderwriting and Pricing\nGlobal Atlantic’s underwriting and pricing functions have dedicated teams, who are supported by multiple corporate functions, including actuarial, finance, operations, compliance, investments, and risk. These functions have guidelines and procedures designed to assess and quantify the risks of each product type originated through its individual or institutional markets.\nGlobal Atlantic’s internal, proprietary technology platform incorporates analytic models with customized third-party software and database technology, allowing Global Atlantic to dynamically analyze its asset and liability cash flow profile across a range of market and policyholder behavior scenarios. This proprietary platform allows Global Atlantic to integrate investment allocation decisions with product pricing, so that the terms of the liabilities it originates reflect its view of the investment environment. The committees responsible for underwriting and pricing are also aligned with other business functions and include representatives from actuarial, finance, operations, investments, risk, and sales.\nGlobal Atlantic also performs suitability reviews for new annuity sales. For sales through banks and broker-dealers, Global Atlantic generally delegates suitability reviews to these distribution partners.\nWhen pricing reinsurance transactions in the institutional market, Global Atlantic performs asset and liability modeling of the block of business to be reinsured and typically re-underwrites the liability assumptions on the block using then-current market conditions, actuarial experience provided by the ceding company, and its own experience from business Global Atlantic has originated. Reinsured blocks of business are integrated into Global Atlantic’s technology and infrastructure systems and monitored in the same manner used across the broader business, combining input from actuarial, risk, investment management, and other functions.\n35\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Management\nGlobal Atlantic has an excellent track record of generating strong investment results, and since February 2021, KKR has been the investment manager of Global Atlantic’s assets. Global Atlantic believes that KKR's investment expertise, broad range of investment management services, and strong origination capabilities are key to maintaining Global Atlantic's successful track record of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. Global Atlantic’s investment management strategy seeks to procure assets that are well-suited to the stable and long-dated nature of Global Atlantic's insurance liabilities.\nGlobal Atlantic seeks to focus on investments that have the potential to generate stable, predictable, long-dated asset cash flows, are of high credit quality, and that focus on capital protection. These kinds of investments have historically consisted of corporate debt, asset-backed finance, specialty finance, transportation finance, securitizations, private loan facilities, and commercial and residential real estate investment opportunities, amongst other asset classes. However, Global Atlantic’s investments are not limited to solely those asset classes.\nSupplementing KKR’s role as an investment advisor, Global Atlantic has retained in-house certain investment origination and allocation functions with expertise in consideration of insurance company asset portfolios. These considerations include asset-liability matching, asset allocation, ongoing portfolio management, and new business pricing across both Global Atlantic’s individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic believes that matching asset and liability cash flows is key to protecting policyholders and achieving its target returns. Global Atlantic’s investment origination and allocation functions are closely integrated with its risk management team, and a group of its risk management professionals is dedicated to supporting investment decision-making. Global Atlantic uses a proprietary risk platform to develop a comprehensive view of the expected cash flow profile of its liabilities and determine the optimal profile of its asset cash flows. Global Atlantic is also capable of developing a bottoms-up view of the cash flows of investments that it considers. These processes help to identify the investments that offer a cash flow profile that is consistent with Global Atlantic’s risk tolerances.\nWorking within Global Atlantic’s cash flow matching framework as well as its regulatory and rating agency requirements, Global Atlantic has a flexible investment mandate, which allows it to pursue asset classes and investment types that it believes offer the best risk-adjusted returns. Global Atlantic believes that the integration of the analytics around its assets and liabilities and its flexible investment mandate enable Global Atlantic to respond dynamically to market conditions and make investment decisions that maximize risk adjusted returns while still protecting Global Atlantic’s policyholders.\nFor additional information regarding Global Atlantic's investment portfolio, see Note 7 \"Investments\" in our financial statements and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segment Balance Sheet Investments—Global Atlantic's Investment Portfolio\".\nCapital\nCapital strength allows insurance companies to meet their future policyholder obligations and to support the growth of their businesses. Global Atlantic believes it has built a strong financial foundation to meet these objectives. Global Atlantic is well capitalized, and its capital position, combined with annual capital generation from its seasoned in-force book of business and third-party capital, helps it to fund new business volume growth. Global Atlantic takes a responsible and flexible capital approach to allocating capital to where it believes is the most attractive alternative available. Global Atlantic manages its capital and liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity to be able to capture investment opportunities as they arise and meet policyholder obligations, even in times of foreseeable stress. \nThe financial strength of Global Atlantic’s life insurance operating subsidiaries is recognized by several ratings agencies. The financial strength ratings of these subsidiaries are “A” with a stable outlook from A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), “A2” with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), “A-” with a positive outlook from S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), and “A” with a stable outlook from Fitch Ratings, Inc. (\"Fitch\").\nGlobal Atlantic also sponsors third-party co-investment vehicles to participate alongside Global Atlantic in qualifying reinsurance opportunities. These sponsored reinsurance vehicles provide third-party capital to support reinsurance transactions. As of December 31, 2024, third parties have committed capital to the sponsored reinsurance vehicles of approximately $5.5 billion, of which $3.1 billion has been deployed. \n36\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Holdings\nStarting with the first quarter of 2024, we report a third segment named Strategic Holdings. Our Strategic Holdings segment is currently comprised of the firm’s ownership in the businesses we acquired through our participation in our core private equity strategy. In our core private equity strategy, our objective is to acquire and manage controlling interests in operating companies, which we intend to hold over a longer period of time and that we believe have a lower anticipated risk profile than our investments in businesses acquired through our traditional private equity strategy. Our core private equity portfolio companies are generally expected to be more stable and typically have lower leverage over our holding period than our traditional private equity portfolio companies. We may acquire in the future other long-term assets in our Strategic Holdings segment that are not part of the core private equity strategy, and our Strategic Holdings segment is not limited to specific industry or constrained to any investment strategy that we may manage for our investment funds or vehicles. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our Strategic Holdings segment consisted of our ownership stakes in 18 companies that we acquired through our core private equity strategy. Based on certain information made available to management as of December 31, 2024, approximately 66% of these companies are based in the Americas, 28% in Europe, and 6% in the Asia-Pacific (based on the geographic location of their headquarters). In addition, based on such information, these companies are primarily engaged in the following business sectors: approximately 33% in Business Services, 30% in Consumer, 14% in technology-media-telecommunications (TMT), 13% in Healthcare, and 10% in Infrastructure.  We currently expect our Strategic Holdings segment to generate income from the receipt of dividends from our ownership stakes in these businesses, and if any ownership stake were to be sold, we would recognize realized investment income from such sale.  \nThe fees and carried interest paid by the third party investors in our core private equity funds continues to be reported in our Asset Management segment and are not reported in our Strategic Holdings segment. Our Asset Management segment charges a quarterly management fee based on invested capital in our Strategic Holdings segment. Additionally, our Asset Management segment charges a performance fee from the sale of our interests in the companies included in our Strategic Holdings segment. The management and performance fees are charged in order to represent the cost of providing advisory services by our Asset Management segment rather than determining the allocable costs borne by our Asset Management segment to support our Strategic Holdings segment. \nCompetition\nOur asset management business competes with other investment managers for both investors in our investment vehicles and investment opportunities. The firm's competitors consist primarily of traditional and alternative asset manager sponsors of public and private investment vehicles, real estate development companies, BDCs, investment banks (including activities conducted by their broker-dealers and investment advisers), commercial finance companies, and operating companies acting as strategic buyers. We believe that competition for investors in our investment vehicles is based primarily on investment performance, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, investor perception of investment managers' drive, focus and alignment of interest, business reputation, duration of relationships, quality of services, pricing, fund terms including fees, and the relative attractiveness of the types of investments that have been or are to be made. We believe that competition for investment opportunities is based primarily on the pricing, terms, and structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution. In addition to these traditional competitors within the global investment management industry, we also face competition from local and regional firms, financial institutions, and sovereign wealth funds in the various countries in which we invest. In certain emerging markets, local firms may have more established relationships with the companies in which we are attempting to invest. These competitors often fall into one of the aforementioned categories but in some cases may represent new types of fund investors, including high net worth individuals, family offices, and state-sponsored entities.  \nThere are numerous funds focused on private equity, real assets, credit, and hedge fund strategies that compete for investor capital. Fund managers have also increasingly adopted investment strategies outside of their traditional focus. For example, traditional asset management firms have acquired alternative asset management firms, and hedge funds focused on credit and equity strategies have taken control positions in companies, while private equity funds have acquired minority equity or debt positions in publicly listed companies. This convergence heighten competition for investments. Furthermore, as institutional fund investors increasingly consolidate their relationships for multiple investment products with a few investment firms, competition for capital from such institutional fund investors may become more acute. However, such consolidation may also lead institutional fund investors to prefer more established investment firms, which could help us to compete against newer entrants or investment firms that are smaller in size or offer more limited types of investment strategies.  We also face extensive competition from both traditional and alternative asset management firms in connection with our business initiatives to increase the number and types of investment products, including our K-Series vehicles, and fundraise directly and indirectly from individual investors, including accredited investors and mass affluent individuals.  \n37\nTable of Contents\nSome of the entities that we compete with as an investment firm may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, and more personnel than us.  In the case of some asset classes and certain investment products, including those offered to individual investors, our competitors may, and sometimes do, have longer operating histories, more established relationships, or greater experience. Several of our competitors also have raised, or may raise, significant amounts of capital and have investment objectives that are similar to the investment objectives of our funds, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive advantages for them. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider range of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Strategic buyers may also be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue enhancements with respect to a targeted portfolio company, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for such investments.\nOur capital markets business competes primarily with investment banks and independent broker-dealers in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. We principally focus our capital markets activities on the firm, our portfolio companies, and fund investors, but we also seek to service other third parties. While we generally target customers with whom we have existing relationships, those customers may have similar relationships with the firm's competitors, many of whom will have access to competing securities transactions, greater financial, technical or marketing resources, or more established reputations than us.\nGlobal Atlantic has always operated in highly competitive markets, but there has been a substantial increase in Global Atlantic's competition in the insurance business as non-traditional firms, including those owned by or with strategic partnerships with alternative asset managers, have entered the insurance sector at a rapid pace. Traditional insurers and reinsurers have also been significantly expanding their areas of expertise and product lines, which could have a significant effect on competition in the insurance industry. These new and traditional competitors may be able to price new business aggressively, with a higher investment risk tolerance, as part of a strategy to gain market share, or increase assets under management.   \nWithin individual markets, Global Atlantic faces a variety of large and small industry participants. Large, established insurers often operate with the benefit of well-known brands, entrenched distribution relationships, or proprietary distribution. All of these companies compete for individual markets sales. Global Atlantic’s flow reinsurance business may also be impacted by competition among insurers in individual markets. The competitiveness of Global Atlantic’s product offerings will depend on the actions of its competitors and Global Atlantic’s ability to actively manage its product offerings. In institutional markets, there have been many block reinsurance transactions as many insurers continue to reevaluate their commitment to business lines and seek reinsurance solutions as a way to de-emphasize or divest non-core businesses, reduce risk, seek capital relief, or improve profitability. The block reinsurance and pension risk transfer markets are also experiencing competition due to new entrants, including entrants which have strategic partnerships with alternative asset managers and entrants based outside of the United States. Increased competition across all of our product offerings may make it more difficult for Global Atlantic to identify and execute transactions with terms that are commercially acceptable based on our risk tolerance and target return objectives. Increased competition may also increase regulatory scrutiny of individual or institutional markets activity.\nCompetition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees and consultants, including those with industry-specific expertise, such as employees and consultants in our insurance business. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new investment professionals, other employees, and consultants and retain and motivate our existing investment professionals, other employees, and consultants. We are also impacted by Global Atlantic's ability to attract and retain insurance professionals in the United States and Bermuda, including wholesalers, actuaries, risk management professionals, and agents.\nFor additional information regarding the level of competition we face, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The investment management and insurance businesses are intensely competitive.\"\nHuman Capital\nWe believe our people and our culture are the keys to our success and what sets our firm apart. We strive to create a workplace environment where employees thrive both professionally and personally. At KKR, our philosophy is to ensure we rigorously and effectively invest in our people throughout their careers. Our key focuses include driving exceptional performance and enhancing our firm's culture of collaboration. \n38\nTable of Contents\nThe primary goal in our human capital management team is to attract, develop, and retain exceptional talent at KKR by providing them with meaningful and well-understood careers. We therefore focus on employee training and professional development. Where appropriate, we offer workshops, mentoring, and executive coaching to supplement on-the-job experiences and ongoing feedback and coaching to maximize performance. In addition, fostering a culture of physical, mental, and emotional health and wellness is a priority for KKR, and we offer tools and resources to our employees so they can make informed health care decisions for themselves and their families. \nIn a people driven business, we believe a breadth of perspectives, skills, and experiences working together collaboratively is the most effective means of producing exceptional results. We pursue this aspiration in a variety of ways including through our different internal committees, strategic external partnerships, and our broader engagement in different communities. We believe this multi-faceted approach gives us the best opportunity to attract, develop, and retain the best possible talent, which we believe is integral to our success.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 4,834 people worldwide\n(1)\n:\nAsset Management\n2,523 \nInsurance\n1,613 \nSubsidiary Organizations\n(2)\n698 \nTotal Employees\n4,834\n \n(1)\nThe employment headcount categories above align with our internal human capital headcount reporting and may diverge in certain respects with respect to our employees who are responsible for generating the financial results within each of our three reporting segments. Certain employees reported in the separate categories above, including our business operations professionals, may also perform certain functions in support of another headcount category.  Our strategic holdings segment is supported by employees within the asset management headcount category.  \n(2)\nIncludes employees from our majority owned and controlled subsidiaries that do not directly engage in KKR's legacy asset management or insurance businesses.\nAsset Management \nOur asset management employees includes our investment professionals, our team of operating professionals at KKR Capstone, and our business operations professionals (some of whom may also support our insurance business). \nOur asset management employees come from diverse professional backgrounds in private equity, real assets, credit, and other asset classes and include employees with operations, strategic consulting, risk management, liability management, and finance experience. As a group, these professionals provide us with a strong global team for identifying attractive investment opportunities, creating value, and generating superior returns. We have developed an institutionalized process for creating value in investments. As part of our effort, we utilize a team of operating professionals at KKR Capstone, who work exclusively with our investment professionals and portfolio company management teams or our designees. With professionals in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, KKR Capstone provides additional expertise for assessing investment opportunities and assisting managers of portfolio companies in defining strategic priorities and implementing operational changes. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 941 investment professionals and KKR Capstone operating professionals. \nOur other asset management employees come from diverse professional backgrounds in capital markets, operations, economics, capital raising, client services, public affairs, finance, tax, legal, compliance, risk management, human capital, marketing and communications, investor relations, and information technology. As a group, these professionals provide us with a strong team for supporting our investment activities and performing capital markets activities, servicing our existing clients, and creating relationships with new clients globally.  \nInsurance\nGlobal Atlantic employs professionals with diverse professional backgrounds in the insurance industry, including individual channel sales, reinsurance, investment origination and allocation, risk management, actuarial and business operations support functions (some of whom may also support our asset management business). Global Atlantic's employees seek to provide attractive products for Global Atlantic's policyholders, solutions for its clients and risk-adjusted returns for us.\n39\nTable of Contents\nResponsible Investment Management \nIn our experience, the thoughtful review and possible management of sustainability, regulatory, and geopolitical issues is an essential part of long-term business success in a rapidly changing world. We believe incorporating such business-relevant issues in our investment process can help us both create and protect value. We seek to invest responsibly by incorporating sustainability, regulatory, and geopolitical considerations into our investment decision-making and investment management practices using an approach that prioritizes business-relevant topics that KKR considers most significant for maximizing and protecting the value of our portfolio companies and assets. Our Responsible Investment Policy, which is publicly available, articulates KKR’s responsible investment framework and approaches that KKR believes are broadly relevant for each asset class.  \n40\nTable of Contents\nOrganizational Structure  \nThe following simplified diagram, which excludes multiple legal entities, illustrates our organizational structure as of February 28, 2025.  \n(1)\nKKR Management LLP, which is owned by senior KKR employees, is the sole holder of Series I preferred stock of KKR & Co. Inc. The Series I preferred stock will be redeemed and cancelled, and KKR & Co. Inc.'s common stock will become vested with all common voting powers on a one vote per share basis, on the \"Sunset Date\" (which will be no later than December 31, 2026 as provided in the Reorganization Agreement); see \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this report. \n(2)\nCarried interest earned from our investment funds is allocated to KKR Associates Holdings L.P., which we refer to as the carry pool, from which carried interest that is earned from our investment funds is allocable to our employees and other persons.  This entity and the carry pool are not reflected in the organizational structure chart. See  \"Part III—Item 11—Executive Compensation\" and \"Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Asset Management—Expenses—Compensation and Benefits\" in this report for further detail on the percentage of carried interest that is allocable to the carry pool. A wholly-owned subsidiary of KKR & Co. Inc. will become the general partner of KKR Associates Holdings L.P. and thereby acquire control of the carry pool on the \"Sunset Date\" (which will be no later than December 31, 2026 as provided in the Reorganization Agreement; see \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" in this report). \n(3)\nIncludes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., the SEC-registered investment adviser, which in turn is the parent company of KKR's other principal investment management and broker-dealer subsidiaries.\n(4)\nIncludes our insurance business operated by Global Atlantic. \n41\nTable of Contents\nRegulation\nOur operations are subject to regulation and supervision in a number of jurisdictions. The level of regulation and supervision to which we are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. We, in conjunction with our outside advisors and counsel, seek to manage our business and operations in compliance with such regulation and supervision. The regulatory and legal requirements that apply to our activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more restrictive, which may make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business activities in the manner in which they are now conducted. Changes in applicable regulatory and legal requirements, including changes in their enforcement, could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. As a matter of public policy, the regulatory bodies that regulate our business activities are generally responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities, insurance and financial markets and protecting fund investors and policyholders who participate in those markets rather than protecting the interests of our stockholders. For further information regarding potential risks relating to these and other regulatory and legal requirements that could significantly affect our business, see the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report, including \"—Risks Related to Our Business—Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties, which could materially and adversely affect KKR.\" \nUnited States\nRegulation as an Investment Adviser\nWe conduct our advisory business through our investment adviser subsidiaries, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, KKR Registered Advisor LLC and KKR Credit Advisors (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., each of which is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \"Investment Advisers Act\"). We also jointly own with a third party FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, which is an investment adviser registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. In addition, we own Global Atlantic's investment adviser, Global Atlantic Investment Advisors, LLC, which is another investment adviser registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. The investment advisers are subject to, among other Investment Advisers Act provisions, the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions, which apply to our relationships with our advisory clients globally, including funds that we manage. These provisions and duties impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our fund investors and our investments, including for example restrictions on agency cross and principal transactions. Our registered investment advisers are subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements under the Investment Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit advisory clients. These additional requirements relate, among other things, to maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance program, record-keeping and reporting requirements and disclosure requirements. The Investment Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines.\nKKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, KKR Registered Advisor LLC and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. are also subject to regulation as investment advisers to RICs under the Investment Company Act. RICs advised by our investment advisers include KKR Income Opportunities Fund, KKR Credit Opportunities Portfolio and KREST. The Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, among other things, regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or restrict principal transactions and joint transactions. FS/KKR Advisor serves as investment adviser to FS KKR Capital Corp., KKR FS Income Trust and KKR FS Income Trust Select, which are subject to regulations applicable to BDCs under the Investment Company Act, including portfolio construction requirements and limitations on transactions with affiliates. Certain subsidiaries of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. also serve as investment advisers to publicly listed companies, including KKR Real Estate Finance Trust and Crescent Energy.\n42\nTable of Contents\nRegulation as a Broker-Dealer\nKKR Capital Markets, LLC, one of our subsidiaries, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC under the Exchange Act and in 53 U.S. states and territories, and is a member of FINRA. Global Atlantic's distribution of insurance products that are regulated as securities is conducted by Global Atlantic Distributors, LLC, which is also registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC under the Exchange Act and in 52 U.S. states and territories, and is also a member of the FINRA. As registered broker-dealers, KKR Capital Markets, LLC and Global Atlantic Distributors, LLC are subject to periodic SEC and FINRA examinations and reviews. A broker-dealer is subject to legal requirements covering all aspects of its securities business, including sales and trading practices, public and private securities offerings, the suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers' funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers, employees, and other associated persons. These requirements include the SEC's \"uniform net capital rule,\" which specifies the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain, requires a significant part of the broker-dealer's assets to be kept in relatively liquid form, imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing its capital and subjects any distributions or withdrawals of capital by a broker-dealer to notice requirements. These and other requirements also include rules that limit a broker-dealer's ratio of subordinated debt to equity in its regulatory capital composition, constrain a broker-dealer's ability to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose additional requirements when the broker-dealer participates in securities offerings of affiliated entities. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of the broker-dealer or its officers or employees or other similar consequences by regulatory bodies.\nInsurance Regulation\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision under U.S. federal and state laws. Each U.S. state, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories and possessions have insurance laws that apply to companies licensed to carry on an insurance business in the applicable jurisdiction. The primary regulator of an insurance company, however, is located in the insurance company's state of domicile. Both Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company and First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company are organized and domiciled in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; Accordia Life and Annuity Company (\"Accordia\") is organized and domiciled in the State of Iowa; and Forethought Life Insurance Company is organized and domiciled in the State of Indiana (together, these four companies constitute our \"U.S. insurance subsidiaries\"). Additionally, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact insurance business in, and are subject to regulation and supervision by, all 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,  and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nState insurance authorities have broad administrative powers over each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries with respect to all aspects of the insurance business. Insurance subsidiaries must prepare financial statements on regulatory capital in accordance with statutory financial accounting, must report on their risk management and corporate governance and must receive regulatory approval for certain transactions, including transactions with affiliates. As part of their routine regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts and operations of insurance companies that are domiciled in their states. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other, non-domiciliary states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \"NAIC\"). State insurance departments also regularly conduct regulatory inquiries of the insurance companies licensed in their states.\nWe also have special purpose financial captive insurance company subsidiaries domiciled in Vermont and Iowa that provide reinsurance to Accordia in order to facilitate the financing of redundant reserve requirements associated with the application of the NAIC Model Regulation entitled \"Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation\" (\"Regulation XXX\") and NAIC Actuarial Guideline XXXVIII (\"AG38\"). The application of both Regulation XXX and AG38 requires Global Atlantic to maintain statutory reserves which may be in excess of reserves required under GAAP.\nThe rates, policy terms, and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any regulatory authority. However, the ability of a primary insurer to take credit for the reinsurance purchased from reinsurance companies is a significant component of reinsurance regulation. Typically, a primary insurer will only enter into a reinsurance agreement if it can obtain credit against its reserves on its statutory basis financial statements for the reinsurance ceded to the reinsurer.\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Any proposed dividend in excess of the amount permitted by law is considered an \"extraordinary dividend or distribution\" and may not be paid until it has been approved, or a 30-day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved, by the commissioner of the applicable domiciliary state of the U.S. insurance subsidiary. None of our special purpose financial captive insurance company subsidiaries may declare or pay dividends or distributions in any form to us other than in accordance with its transaction agreements and governing licensing order.\n43\nTable of Contents\nState insurance holding company laws and regulations generally provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in any parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of such insurance company's domiciliary state insurance regulator. Under the laws of each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary states, acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered to have acquired control of the insurer, although such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not in fact exist.\nFinally, while the United States federal government in most contexts currently does not directly regulate the insurance business, the Federal Insurance Office (the \"FIO\") established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") now has an oversight role with respect to insurance regulation.\nRegulation Related to Special Servicing  \nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, K-Star Asset Management LLC (\"K-Star\") serves as a special servicer for certain CMBS and CLO transactions in which funds and/or accounts managed by our investment adviser subsidiaries have controlling positions. Its business is subject to state regulations in certain states in which it operates, including regulations requiring K-Star to maintain a special servicer rating from Fitch, S&P Global Ratings, and DB Morningstar, applicable regulations in the states in which such serviced property is located, and other regulations applicable to K-Star's obligations under the relevant servicing agreements.\nIreland\nWe have a number of subsidiaries which are authorized and regulated by the CBI. The CBI is responsible for, among other things, regulating and supervising firms that provide financial services in Ireland, including broker-dealers and investment firms. The CBI also develops and maintains regulatory policies for Ireland's financial services sector. The CBI has the authority to approve applications from financial services providers in Ireland, monitor compliance with its standards, and take enforcement action for non-compliance. Violation of the CBI's requirements may result in administrative sanctions; investigations; refusal, revocation or cancellation of authorization or registrations; criminal prosecution; and/or reports to other agencies. \nKKR Alternative Investment Management Unlimited Company, KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) Unlimited Company and KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited Company are regulated by the CBI. KKR Alternative Investment Management Unlimited Company is an authorized European Union (\"EU\") alternative investment manager permitted to conduct portfolio management, risk management and certain administrative activities. KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) Unlimited Company is authorized to carry out a number of regulated activities under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”), including receiving and transmitting orders, portfolio management and providing investment advice. KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) Unlimited Company is also subject to limited regulatory supervision in Germany through KKR Credit Advisors Ireland Frankfurt Branch, France through KKR Credit Advisors Ireland Paris Branch, and Denmark through KKR Credit Advisors Ireland Copenhagen Branch, where these entities operate under the MiFID Freedom of Establishment rules.

KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited also benefits from a passport under the single market directives to offer services cross border into all countries in the European Economic Area.\nIn Europe, we operate in accordance with the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (the “AIFMD”), which establishes a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework for alternative investment fund managers (“AIFMs”) that manage or market alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) in the EU. \nUnited Kingdom\nWe have several subsidiaries which are authorized and regulated by the FCA under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"FSMA\"). FSMA and related rules govern most aspects of investment business, including investment management, sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, corporate finance, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, regulatory capital, record-keeping, margin practices and procedures, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering, periodic reporting, and settlement procedures. The FCA is responsible for administering these requirements and our compliance with the FSMA and related rules. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, imposition of additional requirements, injunctions, restitution orders, revocation or modification of permissions or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from certain \"controlled functions\" within the financial services industry of officers or employees performing such functions or other similar consequences.\n44\nTable of Contents\nKKR Capital Markets Partners LLP has permission to engage in a number of regulated activities regulated under FSMA, including dealing as principal or agent and arranging deals in relation to certain types of specified investments and arranging the safeguarding and administration of assets. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Partners LLP has permission to engage in a number of regulated activities including advising on and arranging deals relating to corporate finance business in relation to certain types of specified investments. KKR Credit Advisors (EMEA) LLP has permission to engage in a number of regulated activities including managing, advising on and arranging deals in relation to certain types of specified investments.\nBermuda\nOur insurance subsidiaries organized in Bermuda, Global Atlantic Re and Global Atlantic Assurance, and reinsurance co-investment vehicles sponsored by Global Atlantic are subject to regulation and supervision by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (\"BMA\") and compliance with all applicable Bermuda laws and Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Bermuda Insurance Act. The Bermuda Insurance Act grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies and to approve any change or controllers. The Bermuda Insurance Act imposes solvency, capital and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies. The Bermuda Insurance Act prohibits our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year unless certain financial conditions are met or prior approval from the BMA is received. A Bermuda licensed insurer is required to maintain a sufficiently staffed principal office in Bermuda.\nOther Jurisdictions\nCertain other subsidiaries or funds that we advise are registered with, have been licensed by or have obtained authorizations to operate in their respective jurisdictions other than the jurisdictions described above, including Australia, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and United Arab Emirates.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR & Co. Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors.\" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  \nBusiness Environment\nOur asset management, insurance, and strategic holdings segments are affected by the various market and economic conditions of the various countries and regions in which we operate. Market and economic conditions are expected to continue to have a substantial impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and our business in various ways that we are unable to control, including our ability to make new investments, the valuations of the investments we manage, the amount of investment proceeds we realize when we exit our investments, the timing for such realization activity, our ability to fundraise or to sell our various investment and insurance products and services, and the level of our capital markets activities, as discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Report. \nIn 2024, the United States continued to experience economic growth while also continuing to experience persistent inflation in excess of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s target rate. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board lowered the target range for the federal funds rate three times in 2024, including a rate reduction in December lowering the target range to 4.25-4.50%. However, in early 2025, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate, noting its dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.\nGDP growth in the Eurozone in 2024 was moderately positive. In Europe, the European Central Bank lowered rates four times in 2024, lowering the deposit rate to 3% as Eurozone inflation slowed as compared to the prior year albeit remaining above the European Central Bank’s 2% inflation target. \nIn Asia, the two largest economies continued to experience divergent economic conditions during 2024. Japan’s economy is expected to have experienced positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Bank of Japan raised interest rates twice in 2024, ultimately up to 0.25%. In China, the economy grew in 2024, but Chinese growth remains subject to various headwinds including in the property sector. \nSeveral key economic indicators in the United States and in other countries and regions in which we operate include:\n•\nGDP.\n In the United States, real gross domestic product (“GDP”) is expanded by 2.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to an expansion of 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Eurozone real GDP increased by 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, up from 0.4% growth for the year ended December 31, 2023. In Japan, real GDP is estimated to have decreased by 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, down from 1.5% expansion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Real GDP in China increased by 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to growth of 5.4% reported for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n•\nInterest Rates.\n The effective federal funds rate set by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board was 4.33% as of December 31, 2024, down from 5.33% as of December 31, 2023. The short-term benchmark interest rate set by the European Central Bank was 3.15% as of December 31, 2024, down from 4.5% as of December 31, 2023. The short-term benchmark interest rate set by the Bank of Japan was 0.25% as of December 31, 2024, up from -0.1% as of December 31, 2023. The short-term benchmark interest rate set by The People's Bank of China was 3.10% as of December 31, 2024, down from 3.45% as of December 31, 2023.\n•\nInflation.\n The U.S. core consumer price index rose 3.2% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2024, down from 3.9% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2023. Eurozone core inflation was 2.7% as of December 31, 2024, down from 3.4% as of December 31, 2023. In Japan, core inflation rose to 1.6% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2024, down from 2.8% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2023. Core inflation in China was 0.4% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2024, down from 0.6% as of December 31, 2023.\n•\nUnemployment. \nThe U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1% as of December 31, 2024, up from 3.8% as of December 31, 2023. Eurozone unemployment was 6.3% as of December 31, 2024, down from 6.5% as of December 31, 2023. The unemployment rate in Japan was 2.5% as of December 31, 2024, unchanged from 2.5% as of December 31, 2023. The unemployment rate in China was 5.0% as of December 31, 2024, unchanged from 5.0% as of December 31, 2023.  \n132\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, the United States equity markets, appreciated significantly on a year-over-year basis, with varying volatility throughout the year, and the U.S. 10-year benchmark treasury yield also fluctuated throughout the year to end at a rate lower at year-end than at the prior year-end of 2023. Short term interest rates fell as the Federal Reserve lowered benchmark interest rates; however, there was an increase in longer term U.S. interest rates. European, Japanese and Chinese equity markets all appreciated on a year-over-year basis.\nSeveral key financial market indicators in the United States and in other countries and regions in which we operate include:  \n•\nEquity Markets.\n For the year ended December 31, 2024, the S&P 500 was up 25.5%, the MSCI Europe Index was up 2.6%, the MSCI Asia Index was up 10.4% and the MSCI World Index was up 19.5% on a total return basis including dividends. Equity market volatility as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of volatility, ended at 17.4 as of December 31, 2024, increasing from 12.5 as of December 31, 2023, and peaking at 38.6 as of August 5, 2024.\n•\nCredit Markets.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, U.S. investment grade corporate bond spreads (BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index) tightened by 22 basis points. The non-investment grade credit indices were up during the year ended December 31, 2024 with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index up 9.0% and the BofAML HY Master II Index up 8.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the 10-year government bond yields rose 69 basis points in the United States, rose 34 basis points in Germany, rose 49 basis points in Japan, rose 103 basis points in the UK and fell 89 basis points in China.\n•\nCommodity Markets.\n During the year ended December 31, 2024, the 3-year forward price of WTI crude oil decreased approximately 0.5%, and the 3-year forward price of natural gas decreased from approximately $4.44 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2023 to $4.36 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2024. The Japan spot LNG import price decreased to approximately $13.82 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2024 from approximately $16.92 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2023. \n•\nForeign Exchange Rates.\n For the year ended December 31, 2024, the euro fell 6.2%, the British pound fell 1.7%, the Japanese yen fell 10.3%, and the Chinese renminbi fell 2.7%, respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar.\nOther Trends, Uncertainties and Risks Related to Our Business\nPlease refer to the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Report for important additional detail regarding risks, uncertainties, and other conditions that could have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on our businesses, including the impact of market and economic conditions on valuations of investments and the impact of competition we face.\n \nThese risks, uncertainties, and other conditions should be read in conjunction with this Business Environment section and the entire Risk Factor section. In particular, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Our valuation methodologies for certain assets can be subjective, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such subjective methodologies is uncertain and may never be realized”,  “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investment Activities—Various market and economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on our financial results”, and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The investment management and insurance businesses are intensely competitive.\"\nBasis of Accounting and Key Financial Measures under GAAP\nWe manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our operating activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See Note 2 “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our financial statements and “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in this section below. Our key Segment and non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics are discussed below. \n133\nTable of Contents\nKey Segment and Non-GAAP Performance Measures \nThe following key segment and non-GAAP performance measures are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the performance of KKR's business. They include certain financial measures that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These performance measures as described below are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. Inc. and holders of exchangeable securities and as such represent the entire KKR business in total. In addition, these performance measures are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of certain investment funds and collateralized financing entities (\"CFEs\") that KKR manages.\nWe believe that providing these segment and non-GAAP performance measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's business. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable are included under \"—Segment Balance Sheet Measures—Reconciliations to GAAP Measures.\"\nModification of Segment Information and Non-GAAP Measures\nIn connection with the scaling of the core private equity strategy on KKR’s balance sheet and the acquisition of all of the remaining equity interests in Global Atlantic on January 2, 2024, KKR reevaluated the manner in which it makes operational and resource deployment decisions and assesses the overall performance of KKR's business. Effective with the first quarter of 2024, the items detailed below have changed with respect to the preparation of the reports used by KKR's chief operating decision makers. As a result, KKR has modified the presentation of its segment financial information with retrospective application to all prior periods presented.\n The most significant changes between KKR's current segment presentation and its previous segment presentation reported prior to the first quarter of 2024, are as follows:\n•\nCreating a new business segment, Strategic Holdings - The new segment is currently comprised of KKR’s participation in its core private equity strategy. Our participation in our core private equity has scaled into a business KKR now evaluates separately from its Asset Management segment. Additionally, KKR may also acquire other long-term assets that are not part of the core private equity strategy for this segment. As of the first quarter of 2024, KKR’s participation in its core private equity strategy no longer is reported as part of the Asset Management segment. The Asset Management segment continues to represent KKR's business separate from its insurance operations and continues to reflect how the chief operating decision makers allocate resources and assess performance in the asset management business, which includes operating collaboratively across its business lines, with predominantly a single expense pool. Effective as of the first quarter of 2024, the results of our Strategic Holdings segment includes a management fee and performance fee that is paid to our Asset Management segment for providing advisory services rather than allocating the costs borne by our Asset Management segment to support our Strategic Holdings segment. The historical amounts presented herein do not include any management or performance fees since the governing agreement was not in place prior to the first quarter of 2024. \n•\nSegment Earnings - Segment Earnings is the performance measure for KKR's segment profitability and is used by management in making operational decisions and to assess performance.\n134\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income (\"ANI\") is a performance measure of KKR’s earnings, which is derived from KKR’s reported segment results. ANI is used to assess the performance of KKR’s business operations and measures the earnings potentially available for distribution to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business. ANI is equal to Total Segment Earnings less Interest Expense, Net and Other and Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings. Interest Expense, Net and Other includes interest expense on debt obligations not attributable to any particular segment net of interest income earned on cash and short-term investments. Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings represents the (i) amount of income taxes that would be paid assuming that all pre-tax Asset Management and Strategic Holdings segment earnings were allocated to KKR & Co. Inc. and taxed at the same effective rate, which assumes that all securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. were exchanged and (ii) amount of income taxes on Insurance Operating Earnings. Income taxes on Insurance Operating Earnings represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments. Equity based compensation expense is excluded from ANI, because (i) KKR believes that the cost of equity awards granted to employees does not contribute to the earnings potentially available for distributions to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business and (ii) excluding this expense makes KKR’s reporting metric more comparable to the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in KKR’s industry, which KKR believes enhances an investor’s ability to compare KKR’s performance to these other companies. Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings includes the benefit of tax deductions arising from equity-based compensation, which reduces Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings during the period. If tax deductions from equity-based compensation were to be excluded from Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings, KKR’s ANI would be lower and KKR’s effective tax rate would appear to be higher, even though a lower amount of income taxes would have actually been paid or payable during the period. KKR separately discloses the amount of tax deduction from equity-based compensation for the period reported and the effect of its inclusion in ANI for the period. KKR makes these adjustments when calculating ANI in order to more accurately reflect the net realized earnings that are expected to be or become available for distribution to KKR’s equity holders or reinvestment into KKR’s business. However, ANI does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under KKR’s dividend policy, which is a fixed amount per period, and ANI should not be viewed as a measure of KKR’s liquidity.  \nTotal Segment Earnings\nTotal Segment Earnings is a performance measure that KKR believes is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that KKR does not believe arise from or relate directly to KKR's operations. Total Segment Earnings excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, and (iii) transaction-related and non-operating items, if any. Transaction-related and non-operating items arise from corporate actions and non-operating items, which consist of: (i) impairments, (ii) transaction costs from acquisitions, (iii) depreciation on real estate that KKR owns and occupies, (iv) contingent liabilities, net of any recoveries, and (v) other gains or charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of KKR's ongoing operational performance. Inter-segment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. These transactions include (i) management fees earned by our Asset Management segment as the investment adviser for Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) management and performance fees earned by our Asset Management segment for acquiring and managing the companies included in our Strategic Holdings segment, and (iii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where our Asset Management segment borrows from our Insurance segment. All these inter-segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the applicable governing agreements. Total Segment Earnings represents the total segment earnings of KKR’s Asset Management, Insurance and Strategic Holdings segments.\nAsset Management Segment Earnings\nAsset management segment earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Realized Performance Income, (iii) Realized Performance Income Compensation, (iv) Realized Investment Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income Compensation. Asset Management Segment Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) unrealized gains (losses) on investments, (ii) unrealized carried interest, and (iii) unrealized carried interest compensation. Management fees earned by KKR as the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, vehicles and accounts, including its Global Atlantic insurance companies and Strategic Holdings segment, are included in Asset Management Segment Earnings.\n135\nTable of Contents\nInsurance Operating Earnings\nInsurance Operating Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Insurance segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Net Investment Income, (ii) Net Cost of Insurance, and (iii) General, Administrative, and Other Expenses. Insurance Operating Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) investment gains (losses) which include realized gains (losses) related to asset/liability matching investment strategies and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (ii) non-operating changes in policy liabilities and derivatives which includes (a) changes in the fair value of market risk benefits and other policy liabilities measured at fair value and related benefit payments, (b) fees attributed to guaranteed benefits, (c) derivatives used to manage the risks associated with policy liabilities, and (d) losses at contract issuance on payout annuities. Insurance Operating Earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related to asset/liability matching investment strategies and (ii) the investment management costs that are earned by our Asset Management segment as the investment adviser of the Global Atlantic insurance companies. \nStrategic Holdings Segment Earnings\nStrategic Holdings Segment Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Strategic Holdings segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: Dividends, Net and Net Realized Investment Income. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings excludes the impact of unrealized gains (losses) on investments. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings includes management fees and performance fee expenses that are earned by the Asset Management segment. \nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess the Asset Management segment’s generation of earnings from revenues that are measured and received on a more recurring basis as compared to KKR’s investing earnings. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of our fee generating asset management and capital markets businesses. FRE equals (i) Management Fees, including fees paid by the Insurance and Strategic Holdings segments to the Asset Management segment and fees paid by Ivy vehicles and other reinsurance vehicles, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (x) Fee Related Compensation, and (y) Other Operating Expenses.  \n \nFee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of performance fees from certain AUM that has an indefinite term and for which there is no immediate requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. Fee related performance revenues consists of performance fees (i) expected to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) that are not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.\nFee Related Compensation refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, paid from (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues.\nOther Operating Expenses represents the sum of (i) occupancy and related charges and (ii) other operating expenses.\nStrategic Holdings Operating Earnings\nStrategic Holdings Operating Earnings is a performance measure used to assess the firm’s earnings from companies and businesses reported through its Strategic Holdings segment. Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings currently consists of earnings derived from dividends that the firm receives from businesses acquired through the firm’s participation in our core private equity strategy. Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings currently equals dividends less management fees that are earned by our Asset Management segment. This measure is used by management to assess the Strategic Holdings segment’s generation of earnings from revenues that are measured and received on a more recurring basis than, and are not dependent on, realizations from investment activities.\nTotal Operating Earnings\nTotal Operating Earnings is a performance measure that represents the sum of (i) FRE, (ii) Insurance Operating Earnings, and (iii) Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of the most recurring forms of earnings from each of KKR’s segments as compared to investing earnings.\n136\nTable of Contents\nTotal Investing Earnings\nTotal Investing Earnings is a performance measure that represents the sum of (i) Net Realized Performance Income and (ii) Net Realized Investment Income. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the earnings of KKR’s segments from the realization of investments.\nTotal Asset Management Segment Revenues\nTotal Asset Management Segment Revenues is a performance measure that represents the realized revenues of the Asset Management segment (which excludes unrealized carried interest and unrealized gains (losses) on investments) and is the sum of (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, (iv) Realized Performance Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income. Asset Management Segment Revenues excludes Realized Investment Income earned based on the performance of businesses presented in the Strategic Holdings segment. KKR believes that this performance measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into all forms of realized revenues generated by our Asset Management segment.\nKey Operating and Capital Metrics  \nAssets Under Management\nAssets under management represent the assets managed, advised or sponsored by KKR from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees or performance income (currently or upon a future event), general partner capital, and assets managed, advised or sponsored by our strategic BDC partnership and the hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of KKR and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed or sponsored capital. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds and certain co-investment vehicles; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently not earning management fees or performance income; (iii) the asset value of the Global Atlantic insurance companies; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs; (v) KKR's pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest; (vi) all of the AUM of KKR's strategic BDC partnership; (vii) the acquisition cost of invested assets of certain non-US real estate investment trusts and (viii) the value of other assets managed or sponsored by KKR. The pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on KKR’s percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity’s respective AUM. KKR's definition of AUM (i) is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the governing documents of the investment funds, vehicles, accounts or other entities whose capital is included in this definition, (ii) includes assets for which KKR does not act as an investment adviser, and (iii) is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. \nCapital Invested\nCapital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) KKR’s investment funds and Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) KKR's Principal Activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) KKR's Principal Activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by KKR's Capital Markets business line, if any. Capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at KKR during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across KKR’s business lines. Capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. Capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by KKR’s Capital Markets business line. Capital syndicated by KKR's Capital Markets business line to third parties other than KKR’s investment funds or Principal Activities business line is not included in capital invested.  \nFee Paying AUM\nFee paying AUM represents only the AUM from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's and its hedge fund and BDC partnership management fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which KKR is not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it is entitled to receive only performance income or is otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.\n137\nTable of Contents\nUncalled Commitments\nUncalled commitments is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments that KKR’s investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments, and the amount of uncalled commitments is not reduced by capital invested using borrowings under an investment fund’s subscription facility until capital is called from our fund investors. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR’s investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles to make future investments. Uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements or investments we have committed to make but remain unfunded at the reporting date.\n138\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) \nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations on a GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

The increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees from Americas Fund XII and Asian Fund III due to a step-down in each fund's management fee rate and a decrease in invested capital over the past twelve months and (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors IV as a result of entering its post-investment period in the current year, and now earns fees based on invested capital rather than capital committed.\n140\nTable of Contents\nManagement fees due from consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other investment vehicles were not consolidated. For a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" \nFee credits increased compared to the prior period as a result of (i) a higher level of transaction fees in our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines and (ii) a higher level of monitoring fees in our Private Equity and Real Assets business lines. Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other investment vehicles were not consolidated. Transaction and monitoring fees earned from KKR portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, transaction fees earned in our capital markets business are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in our revenues without a corresponding fee credit.\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments in many of our unconsolidated carry-earning investment vehicles, most notably North America Fund XIII, Global Infrastructure Investors IV, and our private equity and infrastructure K-Series vehicles. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments in many of our unconsolidated carry-earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund III, and Global Infrastructure Investors III.\nKKR calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance, resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments.\nInvestment Income (Loss) \nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2024\nThe net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 were comprised of net realized gains of $246.8 million and net unrealized gains of $3,196.0 million.\nInvestment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) as described above. \nRealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, net realized gains related primarily to (i) realized gains on the sale of Söderberg & Partners (financial services sector), FiberCop S.p.A. (infrastructure: telecommunications infrastructure sector), and BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: BBIO) and (ii) realized gains on certain foreign exchange forward contracts. Partially offsetting these realized gains were (i) realized losses on our investments in Selecta Group HoldCo. (consumer products sector), Unzer GmbH (financial services sector), and Telepizza SAU (consumer products sector) and (ii) realized losses from the distribution of certain assets to third-party fund investors in certain of our consolidated energy funds.\n141\nTable of Contents\nUnrealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by mark-to-market gains primarily relating to our investment in USI, Inc. (financial services sector), 1-800 Contacts Inc. (healthcare sector), April SA (financial services sector), and Exact Holding B.V. (technology sector) held through our consolidated core investment vehicles. These unrealized gains were partially offset by (i) mark-to-market losses primarily relating to our investment in BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., PetVet Care Centers, LLC (healthcare sector), and Accell Group N.V. (consumer products sector) and (ii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above.\nThe factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net gains were primarily generated in the following asset classes:\n•\nPrivate Equity (including core private equity), which were primarily impacted by (i) overall positive operating performance of its portfolio companies and (ii) the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments; and\n•\nInfrastructure, which primarily benefited from the positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets and, to a lesser extent, by the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments.\nSee \"Risk Factors\" and \"—Business Environment\" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuation.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2023\nThe net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 were comprised of net realized losses of $(776.5) million and net unrealized gains of $3,801.9 million. \nRealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net realized losses related primarily to (i) a realized loss on our investment in GenesisCare Pty Ltd. (healthcare sector), (ii) realized losses from the distribution of certain assets to third-party investors in certain of our consolidated energy funds, predominantly allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their ownership in our investment funds, (iii) a realized loss on our investment in Envision Healthcare Corporation (healthcare sector), and (iv) realized losses on alternative credit investments, Hilding Anders International AB (consumer products sector) and Chembulk Group (transportation sector), predominantly allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their ownership in our investment funds. Partially offsetting these realized losses were realized gains primarily relating to (i) realizations on certain foreign exchange forward contracts and (ii) the sale of our investment in KnowBe4, Inc. (NASDAQ: KNBE) and Flutter Entertainment PLC (NYSE: FLUT).\nUnrealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains primarily relating to BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., Exact Holding B.V., and USI, Inc., (ii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses relating to the realization activity described above, and (iii) certain investments held in our consolidated CLOs. These unrealized gains were partially offset by mark-to-market losses primarily relating to (i) PetVet Care Centers, LLC, (ii) certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) debt obligations of our consolidated CLOs.\nFor a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" For additional information about net gains (losses) from investment activities, see Note 4 \"Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management and Strategic Holdings\" in our financial statements.\n142\nTable of Contents\nDividend Income\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, dividend income was primarily from (i) our investments in 1-800 Contacts Inc. and Exact Holdings B.V. held through our consolidated core investment vehicles, (ii) certain of our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds, and (iii) our investment in MásOrange (telecommunications sector), held through our consolidated European Fund V. During the year ended December 31, 2023, dividend income was primarily from (i) certain investments held in our consolidated open-ended core infrastructure fund, Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund, (ii) certain of our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds, and (iii) Cegid Group S.A. (technology sector) and Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc. (infrastructure: transportation sector), both held in our consolidated core private equity funds.\nSignificant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's dividend income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" \nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to (i) the impact of closing CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to December 31, 2023 and (ii) the impact of higher interest rates during the period on floating rate credit investments held in consolidated CLOs and our consolidated private credit funds. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\"\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to (i) the increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from certain consolidated funds and other investment vehicles, (ii) the impact of closing CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to December 31, 2023, (iii) the impact of higher interest rates during the current period on floating rate debt obligations held in consolidated CLOs, and (iv) the impact of issuances of KKR senior notes after December 31, 2023. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see \"—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures.\"\nExpenses \nCompensation and Benefits \nThe increase in compensation and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a higher level of accrued carried interest compensation in the current period driven by a higher level of carried interest income earned and a higher percentage allocable to our carry pool in the current period. Additionally, the number of equity-based compensation awards granted in 2023 was higher than in 2022, which resulted in higher equity-based compensation in the current period. \nOccupancy and Related Charges\nThe increase in occupancy and related charges during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the commencement of new office leases in the current period.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\nThe increase in general, administrative and other during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to (i) a provision for legal reserves in the current period, (ii) a higher level of expenses reimbursable by our unconsolidated investment funds, and (iii) issuance costs from newly formed consolidated CLOs in the current period.\nIn periods of increased fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our General, Administrative and Other are expected to increase accordingly. \n143\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) - Insurance\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, revenues consisted of the following: \n \nYears Ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nNet Premiums\n$\n7,898,834 \n$\n1,975,675 \n$\n5,923,159 \nPolicy Fees\n1,377,686 \n1,260,249 \n117,437 \nNet Investment Income\n6,574,608 \n5,514,902 \n1,059,706 \nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n(1,423,086)\n(235,262)\n(1,187,824)\nOther Income\n238,410 \n176,442 \n61,968 \nTotal Insurance Revenues\n$\n14,666,452\n \n$\n8,692,006\n \n$\n5,974,446\n \nNet Premiums\nNet premiums increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in initial premiums assumed from reinsurance transactions with life contingencies or morbidity risk during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was partially offset by higher retrocessions to third party reinsurers during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The initial premiums on assumed reinsurance were offset by a comparable increase in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below under “Expenses—Net policy benefits and claims”).\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in Global Atlantic's institutional market channel as a result of new reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales, and (ii) growth in portfolio yields due to portfolio optimization and asset rotation. \nNet Investment-related Gains (Losses)\nThe components of net investment-related gains (losses) were as follows:\n \nYears Ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nFunds Withheld Payable Embedded Derivatives\n$\n350,241 \n$\n(1,040,463)\n$\n1,390,704 \nEquity Futures Contracts\n(87,484)\n(116,766)\n29,282 \nForeign Exchange and Other Derivative Contracts\n121,716 \n19,891 \n101,825 \nEquity Index Options\n567,543 \n482,121 \n85,422 \nInterest Rate Contracts\n(569,315)\n(101,376)\n(467,939)\nFunds Withheld Receivable Embedded Derivatives\n37,226 \n75,876 \n(38,650)\nNet Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments\n419,927\n \n(680,717)\n1,100,644\n \nNet Other Investment Gains (Losses)\n(1,843,013)\n445,455 \n(2,288,468)\nNet Investment-related Gains (Losses)\n$\n(1,423,086)\n$\n(235,262)\n$\n(1,187,824)\nNet Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments\nThe increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities (designated as trading for accounting purposes), mortgage and other loan receivables, and real asset investments. The underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio decreased in value during the year ended December 31, 2024, and increased during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to market interest rates ending 2023 relatively flat (having generally increased during 2023, and then decreased at the end of fourth quarter 2023). \n144\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in the fair value of foreign exchange and other derivative contracts was primarily driven by a combination of an increase in the notional amount of foreign exchange derivatives, and a strengthening of the U.S. dollar (primarily against the euro and British pound) during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe increase in the fair value of equity index options was primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which these options are based. Global Atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change in which is accounted for in net policy benefits and claims). The majority of Global Atlantic's equity index options are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased during both the year ended December 31, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe decrease in the fair value of interest rate contracts was primarily driven by an increase in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to relatively flat market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in a larger loss on interest rate contracts for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNet Other Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe components of net other investment gains (losses) were as follows:\n \nYears Ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nRealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Not Supporting Asset-Liability Matching Strategies\n$\n22,468 \n$\n36,689 \n$\n(14,221)\nRealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturity Securities\n(567,985)\n(64,140)\n(503,845)\nCredit Loss Allowances\n(390,498)\n(373,282)\n(17,216)\nImpairment of Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturity Securities Due to Intent to Sell\n— \n(26,741)\n26,741 \nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Fixed Maturity Securities Classified as Trading\n(735,209)\n1,031,227 \n(1,766,436)\nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Other Investments Accounted Under a Fair-Value Option and Equity Investments\n9,560 \n(23,540)\n33,100 \nUnrealized Gains (Losses) on Real Assets\n(167,873)\n(202,671)\n34,798 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Real Assets\n11,418 \n71,158 \n(59,740)\nRealized Gains (Losses) on Funds Withheld at Interest Payable Portfolio\n126,422 \n25,427 \n100,995 \nRealized Gains (Losses) on Funds Withheld at Interest Receivable Portfolio\n(62,493)\n(9,193)\n(53,300)\nOther\n(88,823)\n(19,479)\n(69,344)\nNet Other Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n$\n(1,843,013)\n$\n445,455\n \n$\n(2,288,468)\nThe increase in net other investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to (i) an increase in unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities classified as trading primarily as a result of an increase in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to relatively flat market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2023, (having generally increased during 2023, and then decreased at the end of fourth quarter 2023), (ii) an increase in realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities as result of portfolio optimization and asset rotation, and (iii) a decrease in realized gains on real assets.\nOffsetting these increases in net other investment losses was an increase in realized gains on funds withheld at interest payable portfolio.\n145\nTable of Contents\nExpenses\nNet Policy Benefits and Claims\nNet policy benefits and claims increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to (i) an increase in net flows from both individual and institutional market channel sales, (ii) higher initial reserves assumed related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies or morbidity risk in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, (iii) higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the ordinary-course run-off of older business originated in a lower interest rate environment, and (iv) an increase in the value of embedded derivatives in Global Atlantic’s fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of new business inflows and equity market gains (as discussed above under \"–Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)–Revenues–Net investment-related gains (losses),\" Global Atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains (losses) on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims).\nThese increases were offset in part by (i) favorable impacts related to the assumption review described below, and (ii) an increase in market risk benefits gains due to an increase in interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses, and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter, referred to as an \"assumption review.\" As Global Atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent Global Atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an “unlocking” impact. Generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the net favorable assumption review impact of $74.6 million on income before taxes was primarily due to (i) higher assumed mortality rates for guaranteed income riders on fixed-indexed annuities, and (ii) higher assumed interest rate margins on certain interest-sensitive life products due to an increase in assumed reinvestment rates and flat crediting rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by (i) lower assumed surrender rates on interest-sensitive life products without secondary guarantees, (ii) an increase in the option budget assumptions for certain fixed-indexed annuities and interest sensitive life products, and (iii) higher surrender rate assumption for certain assumed flow annuity business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the net unfavorable assumption review impact of $(15.5) million on income before taxes was primarily due to (i) an increase in option cost assumptions for indexed products (net of the impact of reducing caps), (ii) an increase in mortality assumptions related to certain annuity products, and (iii) a decrease in expected surrenders on income annuities and life insurance products. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a favorable impact of lower expected surrenders on accumulation annuities.  \nAmortization of Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of policy acquisition costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to growth in Global Atlantic’s individual market and institutional market channels.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in total debt outstanding.\nInsurance Expenses\nInsurance expenses decreased\n \nfor the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in commission expenses as a result of the timing of new business flow in the institutional markets channel.\n146\nTable of Contents\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\nGeneral, administrative and other decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to decreased employee compensation-related expenses, partially offset by increased technology costs.\nOther Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by the lower level of income before taxes attributable to common stockholders. For a discussion of factors that impacted KKR's tax provision, see Note 18 \"Income Taxes\" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2024 relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to: (i) third-party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles and (ii) exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership until they are exchanged for common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily related to net gains from investment activities at our consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. \nNet income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher level of net policy benefits and claims expense and investment related losses recognized from our insurance operations and higher carried interest compensation expense from our asset management operations. The decrease was partially offset by a higher level of fees and capital allocation-based income from our asset management operations and higher investment-related income recognized by our asset management and strategic holdings operations, as described above.\n147\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) \n \nYears Ended\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange\n \n($ in thousands)\nRevenues\n \n \nAsset Management and Strategic Holdings\nFees and Other\n$\n2,963,869 \n$\n2,821,627 \n$\n142,242 \nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\n2,843,437 \n(2,500,509)\n5,343,946 \n5,807,306 \n321,118 \n5,486,188 \nInsurance\nNet Premiums\n1,975,675 \n1,182,461 \n793,214 \nPolicy Fees\n1,260,249 \n1,261,721 \n(1,472)\nNet Investment Income\n5,514,902 \n4,118,246 \n1,396,656 \nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n(235,262)\n(1,318,490)\n1,083,228 \nOther Income\n176,442 \n139,124 \n37,318 \n8,692,006 \n5,383,062 \n3,308,944 \nTotal Revenues\n14,499,312 \n5,704,180 \n8,795,132 \nExpenses\nAsset Management and Strategic Holdings\nCompensation and Benefits\n3,012,687 \n1,144,666 \n1,868,021 \nOccupancy and Related Charges\n93,391 \n77,271 \n16,120 \nGeneral, Administrative and Other\n1,056,899 \n993,548 \n63,351 \n4,162,977 \n2,215,485 \n1,947,492 \nInsurance\nNet Policy Benefits and Claims (including market risk benefit (gain) loss of $224,380 and $(673,399), respectively; remeasurement (gain) loss on policy liabilities: $15,497 and $(57,128), respectively.)\n6,362,257 \n2,358,238 \n4,004,019 \nAmortization of Policy Acquisition Costs\n87,275 \n55,349 \n31,926 \nInterest Expense\n173,883 \n87,182 \n86,701 \nInsurance Expenses\n825,998 \n562,585 \n263,413 \nGeneral, Administrative and Other\n746,215 \n718,977 \n27,238 \n8,195,628 \n3,782,331 \n4,413,297 \nTotal Expenses\n12,358,605 \n5,997,816 \n6,360,789 \nInvestment Income (Loss) - Asset Management and Strategic Holdings\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities\n3,025,383 \n(1,665,537)\n4,690,920 \nDividend Income\n791,160 \n1,322,447 \n(531,287)\nInterest Income\n3,369,447 \n1,895,282 \n1,474,165 \nInterest Expense\n(2,772,088)\n(1,550,777)\n(1,221,311)\nTotal Investment Income (Loss)\n4,413,902\n \n1,415\n \n4,412,487\n \nIncome (Loss) Before Taxes\n6,554,609 \n(292,221)\n6,846,830 \nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n1,197,523 \n125,393 \n1,072,130 \n148\nTable of Contents\nYears Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nNet Income (Loss)\n5,357,086 \n(417,614)\n5,774,700 \nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n(5,405)\n2,792 \n(8,197)\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n1,630,230 \n101,258 \n1,528,972 \nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co.

The increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees from Americas Fund XII due to a step-down in the management fee rate in 2023 and a decrease in invested capital, (ii) management fees earned on new capital raised for North America Fund XIII in the first quarter of 2022 that was retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period, and (iii) a lower level of management fees from Asian Fund III due to a decrease in its fee base, invested capital, as a result of the sale of investments. There were no management fees that were retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period for the year ended December 31, 2023 for North America Fund XIII.\nManagement fees due from consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other investment vehicles were not consolidated. For a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" \n150\nTable of Contents\nFee credits decreased compared to the prior period primarily as a result of a lower level of transaction fees in our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines in the current period. Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other investment vehicles were not consolidated. Transaction and monitoring fees earned from KKR portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, transaction fees earned in our capital markets business are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in our revenues without a corresponding fee credit.\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments in many of our unconsolidated carry-earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund III, and Global Infrastructure Investors III. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was negative primarily due to the net depreciation of the underlying investments in many of our carry-earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund II, and Asian Fund III.\nKKR generally calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance, resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments.\nInvestment Income (Loss) \nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2023\nThe net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 were comprised of net realized losses of $(776.5) million and net unrealized gains of $3,801.9 million.\nInvestment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) as described above.\nRealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net realized losses related primarily to (i) a realized loss on our investment in GenesisCare Pty Ltd., (ii) realized losses from the distribution of certain assets to third-party investors in certain of our consolidated energy funds, predominantly allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their ownership in our investment funds, (iii) a realized loss on our investment in Envision Healthcare Corporation, and (iv) realized losses on alternative credit investments, Hilding Anders International AB and Chembulk Group, predominantly allocated to noncontrolling interests based on their ownership in our investment funds. Partially offsetting these realized losses were realized gains primarily relating to (i) realizations on certain foreign exchange forward contracts and (ii) the sale of our investment in KnowBe4, Inc. and Flutter Entertainment PLC. \nUnrealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains primarily relating to BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., Exact Holding B.V., and USI, Inc., (ii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses relating to the realization activity described above, and (iii) certain investments held in our consolidated CLOs. These unrealized gains were partially offset by mark-to-market losses primarily relating to (i) PetVet Care Centers, LLC, (ii) certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) debt obligations of our consolidated CLOs.\n151\nTable of Contents\nThe extent and the factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. For the year ended December 31, 2023 net unrealized gains were primarily generated in the following asset classes:\n•\nTraditional private equity (excluding core private equity), which were primarily impacted by (i) the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments and (ii) overall positive operating performance of its portfolio companies;\n•\nCredit, which were primarily impacted by positive performance of our CLOs and by the tightening of the credit spreads during the year; and\n•\nInfrastructure, which primarily benefited from the positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets and, to a lesser extent, by the positive returns of global equity markets and the related increase of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments.\nPartially offsetting the gains in the asset classes above, there were unrealized losses generated in the real estate investments, which, notwithstanding the positive operating performance at certain properties, were negatively impacted by capitalization rates widening further in 2023. See \"Risk Factors\" and \"—Business Environment\" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuation.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2022\nThe net losses from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 were comprised of net realized gains of $1,298.5 million and net unrealized losses of $(2,964.0) million.\nRealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of our investment in Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), (ii) realizations on certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) the sale of real estate investments held in certain consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds. Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating to (i) various investments held in our consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) a realized loss on Magneti Marelli CK Holdings (industrials sector) held in certain consolidated funds, and (iii) realized losses from the sales of revolving credit facilities.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses from Investment Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net unrealized losses were driven primarily by mark-to-market losses from (i) certain debt investments held in our consolidated CLOs and consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) OutSystems Holdings S.A. (technology sector) held in certain consolidated funds, and (iii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above. These unrealized losses were partially offset by mark-to-market gains related to (i) energy investments held in certain consolidated energy funds, (ii) USI, Inc., and (iii) ERM Worldwide Group Limited (services sector).\nFor a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\" For additional information about net gains (losses) from investment activities, see Note 4 \"Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management and Strategic Holdings\" in our financial statements.\nDividend Income\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, dividend income was primarily from (i) our open-ended core infrastructure fund, Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund, (ii) our consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds, and (iii) Cegid Group S.A. and Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc., both held in our consolidated core investment vehicles. During the year ended December 31, 2022, dividend income was primarily from (i) our consolidated core plus and opportunistic real estate equity funds and (ii) our investment in Exact Group B.V. held in our consolidated core investment vehicles.\nSignificant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's dividend income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\"\n152\nTable of Contents\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) the impact of closing CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to December 31, 2022, (ii) higher interest rates on floating rate investments held in consolidated CLOs and our consolidated private credit funds, and (iii) a higher level of interest income from certain of our consolidated private credit funds, related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed.  For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest income, see \"—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.\"\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) the increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from certain consolidated funds and other investment vehicles, (ii) the impact of closing CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to December 31, 2022, (iii) higher interest rates on floating rate debt obligations held in consolidated CLOs, and (iv) the impact of issuances of KKR senior notes after December 31, 2022. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see \"—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures.\"\nExpenses \nCompensation and Benefits  \nThe increase in compensation and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to accrued carried interest compensation in the current period compared to the reversal of previously recognized carried interest compensation in the prior period. Partially offsetting the increase is a lower level of accrued discretionary cash compensation resulting from a lower level of asset management segment revenues in the current period.  \nGeneral, Administrative and Other\nThe increase in general, administrative and other during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) a higher level of expenses from our consolidated investment funds and CLOs due to the impact of consolidating certain new funds and CLOs subsequent to December 31, 2022 and (ii) a higher level of information technology and other administrative costs in connection with the overall growth of the firm. The increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of expenses reimbursable by our unconsolidated investment funds and (ii) a lower level of corporate travel costs and placement fees.\nIn periods of increased fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our General, Administrative and Other are expected to increase accordingly. \nConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) - Insurance\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, revenues consisted of the following: \n \nYears Ended\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nNet Premiums\n$\n1,975,675 \n$\n1,182,461 \n$\n793,214 \nPolicy Fees\n1,260,249 \n1,261,721 \n(1,472)\nNet Investment Income\n5,514,902 \n4,118,246 \n1,396,656 \nNet Investment-Related Gains (Losses)\n(235,262)\n(1,318,490)\n1,083,228 \nOther Income\n176,442 \n139,124 \n37,318 \nTotal Insurance Revenues\n$\n8,692,006\n \n$\n5,383,062\n \n$\n3,308,944\n \n153\nTable of Contents\nNet Premiums\nNet premiums increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in initial premiums assumed from reinsurance transactions with life contingencies during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was partially offset by higher retrocessions to third party reinsurers during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The initial premiums on assumed reinsurance were offset by a comparable increase in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below).\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in Global Atlantic's institutional market channel as a result of new reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales, and (ii) growth in portfolio yields due to higher market interest rates and the benefit in 2023 from rotating into higher yielding assets during 2022.\nNet Investment-related Gains (Losses)\nThe components of net investment-related gains (losses) were as follows:\n \nYears Ended\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nFunds Withheld Payable Embedded Derivatives\n$\n(1,040,463)\n$\n3,448,710 \n$\n(4,489,173)\nEquity Futures Contracts\n(116,766)\n167,924 \n(284,690)\nForeign Exchange and Other Derivative Contracts\n19,891 \n18,821 \n1,070 \nEquity Index Options\n482,121 \n(895,602)\n1,377,723 \nInterest Rate Contracts\n(101,376)\n(333,937)\n232,561 \nFunds Withheld Receivable Embedded Derivatives\n75,876 \n(29,390)\n105,266 \nOther\n— \n(29,779)\n29,779 \nNet Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments\n(680,717)\n2,346,747\n \n(3,027,464)\nNet Other Investment Gains (Losses)\n445,455 \n(3,665,237)\n4,110,692 \nNet Investment-related Gains (Losses)\n$\n(235,262)\n$\n(1,318,490)\n$\n1,083,228\n \nNet Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments\nThe decrease in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities (designated as trading for accounting purposes), mortgage and other loan receivables, and real assets. The underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio increased in value during the year ended December 31, 2023, and decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022, due to market interest rates ending 2023 relatively flat (having generally increased during 2023, and then decreased at the end of fourth quarter 2023) as compared to a significant increase during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease in the fair value of equity futures was driven primarily by the performance of equity markets. Global Atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in its variable annuity products which are accounted for in policy benefits and claims. The majority of Global Atlantic's equity futures are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a decrease during the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in, respectively, a loss, and a gain, on equity futures contracts in the respective periods.\nThe increase in the fair value of interest rate contracts was primarily driven by volatile market interest rates over the course of the year ended December 31, 2023, ending relatively flat for the year in general, as compared to a significant increase in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in a loss on interest rate contracts in both periods, respectively.\n154\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in the fair value of equity index options was primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which call options are based. Global Atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change in which is accounted for in net policy benefits and claims). The majority of Global Atlantic's equity index call options are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a decrease during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest receivable was primarily due to a narrowing of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a widening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNet Other Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe components of net other investment gains (losses) were as

investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to net other investment gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2022, were primarily due to (i) an increase in unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities classified as trading which was primarily due to market interest rates ending the year relatively flat after being volatile during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a significant increase in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2022, (ii) a decrease in realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities which was primarily due to a decrease in portfolio rotation activity during the year ended December 31, 2023, and (iii) an increase in realized gains from real assets, primarily due to a net decrease in realized losses from the disposition of renewable energy investments in the current and prior year.\nOffsetting these increases in net other investment gains were (i) an increase in unrealized losses on real assets due to higher interest and capitalization rates during the year ended December 31, 2023, and (ii) a decrease in realized gains on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies.\n155\nTable of Contents\nExpenses\nNet Policy Benefits and Claims\nNet policy benefits and claims increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) an increase in the value of embedded derivatives in Global Atlantic's indexed universal life and fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of higher equity market returns (as discussed above under \"—Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)—Revenues—Net investment-related gains (losses),\" Global Atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims), (ii) an increase in losses on market risk benefits due to market interest rates generally ending the year relatively flat after being volatile during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to a significant increase in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2022, (iii) an increase in net flows from both individual and institutional market channel sales, (iv) higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the ordinary-course run-off of older business originated in a lower interest rate environment, (v) higher initial reserves assumed related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and (vi) an increase in unfavorable assumption review impacts as discussed below.\nOffsetting these increases was a decrease in variable annuity market risk benefit liabilities primarily due to higher equity market returns for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the net unfavorable assumption review impact of $(15.5) million on income before taxes was primarily due to (i) an increase in option cost assumptions for indexed products (net of the impact of reducing caps), (ii) an increase in mortality assumptions related to certain annuity products, and (iii) a decrease in expected surrenders on income annuities and life insurance products. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a favorable impact of lower expected surrenders on accumulation annuities. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the net favorable assumption review impact of $57.1 million to income before taxes was primarily due to lower utilization of fixed-indexed annuity income benefits and higher variable annuity fees, offset by lower life and annuity surrender rates. \nAmortization of Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of policy acquisition costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to growth in Global Atlantic's individual market and institutional market channels.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) a net increase in total debt outstanding, and (ii) an increase in interest expense on floating rate debt (i.e., Global Atlantic's fixed-to-floating swaps on its fixed rate debt) due to higher market interest rates during portions of the year ended December 31, 2023.\nInsurance Expenses\nInsurance expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased commission expenses and reinsurance transaction expense allowances.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\nGeneral, administrative and other increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased employee compensation and benefits related expenses.\nOther Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to asset management net operating income in the current period as compared to a net operating loss in the prior period driven by Asset Management capital allocation-based losses. For a discussion of factors that impacted KKR's tax provision, see Note 18 \"Income Taxes\" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report. \n156\nTable of Contents\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2023 relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to: (i) exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership, (ii) third party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds, and (iii) interests that third-party investors hold in Global Atlantic. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to net gains from investment activities at our consolidated investment funds and positive income allocable to interests that third party investors hold in Global Atlantic.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. \nNet income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023 was positive as compared to a net loss in the prior period. Net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by capital allocation-based income and net gains from investment activities in asset management in the period. The Net loss attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2022 was driven by capital allocation-based losses and net losses from investment activities in asset management.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition (GAAP Basis)\nPlease see our consolidated statements of financial condition on a GAAP basis as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in our financial statements included in this report.\nOn January 2, 2024, KKR completed the 2024 GA Acquisition. Prior to becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of KKR in the 2024 GA Acquisition, Global Atlantic was majority owned and controlled by KKR, and KKR already consolidated Global Atlantic in the consolidated financial statements of KKR & Co. Inc. The purchase price paid by KKR was approximately $2.6 billion, including the issuance of $41 million of securities exchangeable for shares of KKR & Co. Inc. common stock. Global Atlantic was consolidated prior to January 2, 2024 and consequently, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. At the time of the 2024 GA Acquisition, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in Global Atlantic was lower than the purchase price paid by KKR, which was determined by excluding unrealized losses on its available-for-sale portfolio, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. As such, this transaction resulted in a decrease in KKR & Co. Inc. Stockholders’ Equity. However, this decrease was more than offset by net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. common stockholders, which overall resulted in an increase in Stockholder's Equity - Common Stock compared to December 31, 2023. \n157\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows (GAAP Basis)\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. \nThe consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities, which include certain consolidated investment funds, CLOs and certain variable interest entities formed by Global Atlantic notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those investment funds and CFEs. The assets of our consolidated investment funds and CFEs, on a gross basis, can be substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, could have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and CFEs involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated investment funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.\nNet Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities\nOur net cash provided (used) by operating activities was $6.6 billion, $(1.5) billion, and $(5.3) billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our operating activities primarily included: (i) investments purchased (asset management and strategic holdings), net of proceeds from investments (asset management and strategic holdings) of $(0.7) billion, $(8.6) billion, and $(10.4) billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments (asset management and strategic holdings) of $0.2 billion, $(0.8) billion, and $1.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments (asset management and strategic holdings) of $3.2 billion, $3.8 billion, and $(3.0) billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (iv) capital allocation-based income (loss) (asset management and strategic holdings) of $3.6 billion,  $2.8 billion, and $(2.5) billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (v) net investment and policy liability-related gains (losses) (insurance) of $(3.3) billion, $(2.6) billion, and $(0.4) billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and (vi) interest credited to policyholder account balances (net of policy fees) (insurance) of $4.2 billion, $2.8 billion, and $1.2 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Investment funds are investment companies under GAAP and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value.\nNet Cash Provided (Used) by Investing Activities\nOur net cash provided (used) by investing activities was $(19.0) billion, $(3.9) billion, and $(13.6) billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our investing activities primarily included: (i) investments purchased (insurance), net of proceeds from investments (insurance), of $(18.9) billion, $(3.8) billion, and $(11.8) billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (ii) the purchase of fixed assets of $(141.5) million, $(108.4) million, and $(85.1) million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and (iii) the acquisition of KJRM, net of cash acquired of $(1.7) billion during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNet Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities\nOur net cash provided (used) by financing activities was $7.1 billion, $12.8 billion, and $22.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) contributions from, net of distributions to, our noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests of $0.1 billion, $6.4 billion, and $6.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (ii) proceeds received, net of repayment of debt obligations, of $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion, and $6.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (iii) additions to, net of withdrawals from, contractholder deposit funds (insurance) of $7.9 billion, $1.9 billion, and $9.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (iv) cash consideration for the 2024 GA Acquisition of $(2.6) billion during the year ended December 31, 2024, (v) reinsurance transactions, net of cash provided (insurance) of $47.8 million, $1.2 billion, and $69.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, (vi) common stock dividends of $(612.1) million, $(563.3) million, and $(444.3) million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and (vii) Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends of $(51.7) million, and $(69.0) million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n158\nTable of Contents\nAnalysis of Segment Operating Results\nThe following is a discussion of the results of our business on a segment basis for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

The increase was partially offset by a lower level of management fees from Americas Fund XII and Asian Fund III due to a step-down in each funds' management fee rate and a decrease in invested capital over the past twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately $40.2 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that were retroactive to the start of the relevant fund's investment period.\n159\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in Real Assets management fees was primarily attributable to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from Global Atlantic primarily due to the growth in assets from inflows, (ii) management fees commencing at Global Infrastructure Investors V in the current period, and (iii) management fees earned on new capital raised over the past twelve months at our infrastructure K-Series vehicles. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors IV as a result of entering its post-investment period, which now pays fees based on invested capital rather than capital committed. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately $7.2 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the relevant fund's investment period.\nThe increase in Credit and Liquid Strategies management fees was primarily attributable to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from Global Atlantic primarily due to the growth in assets from inflows, (ii) an increase in capital invested in certain alternative credit strategy accounts, which resulted in an increase in its fee base, and (iii) a higher level of management fees earned from FS KKR Capital Corp. (NYSE: FSK) (\"FSK\"). The increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees from certain leveraged credit strategy accounts driven by the decrease in their fee base from distributions to, and redemptions from, fund investors and (ii) a lower level of management fees from certain SIG funds primarily due to a decrease in the funds' fee base from the sale of investments and the waiver of fees on certain SIG funds.\nTransaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\nThe following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nTransaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\nPrivate Equity\n$\n100,619 \n$\n115,276 \n$\n(14,657)\nReal Assets\n52,508 \n20,564 \n31,944 \nCredit and Liquid Strategies\n10,994 \n7,197 \n3,797 \nCapital Markets\n1,001,763 \n577,617 \n424,146 \nTotal Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\n$\n1,165,884\n \n$\n720,654\n \n$\n445,230\n \nOur Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors. For most of our investment funds, transaction and monitoring fees are credited against fund management fees up to 100% of the amount of the transaction and monitoring fees attributable to that investment fund, which results in a decrease of our monitoring and transaction fees. Our Capital Markets business line earns transaction fees, which are generally not shared with fund investors.\nThe increase in transaction and monitoring fees, net is primarily due to a higher level of transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line. The increase in capital markets transaction fees was primarily due to an increase in the number of capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting increased levels of capital markets issuance activity across the global equity and leveraged loan markets. Overall, we completed 397 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2024, of which 56 represented equity offerings and 341 represented debt offerings, as compared to 239 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which 45 represented equity offerings and 194 represented debt offerings. We earn fees in connection with underwriting, syndication, and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes.\nOur capital markets fees are generated in connection with activity involving our private equity, real assets, and credit funds as well as from third-party companies. For both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 13% of our transaction fees in our Capital Markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 47% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 39% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.\n160\nTable of Contents\nFee Related Performance Revenues\nThe following table presents fee related performance revenues by business line:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nFee Related Performance Revenues\nPrivate Equity\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \nReal Assets\n59,557 \n21,648 \n37,909 \nCredit and Liquid Strategies\n78,435 \n72,779 \n5,656 \nTotal Fee Related Performance Revenues\n$\n137,992\n \n$\n94,427\n \n$\n43,565\n \nFee related performance revenues represent performance fees that are (i) expected to be received from our investment funds, investment vehicles and accounts on a more recurring basis and (ii) not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.\nThese performance fees are primarily earned from (i) FSK (one of our BDCs) in our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line and (ii) KKR Real Estate Select Trust Inc.

If and when such management fees are earned, a portion of existing FPAUM may cease paying fees or pay lower fees, thus offsetting a portion of any new management fees earned.\nSee \"Risk Factors\" and \"—Business Environment\" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuations.\nUncalled Commitments\nPrivate Equity\nAs of December 31, 2024, our Private Equity business line had $54.9 billion of remaining uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $57.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period, which was partially offset by new capital commitments from fund investors.\nReal Assets\nAs of December 31, 2024, our Real Assets business line had $33.3 billion of remaining uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $24.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.\nCredit and Liquid Strategies\nAs of December 31, 2024, our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line had $21.4 billion of remaining uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $16.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, which was partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.\nCapital Invested\nPrivate Equity\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, $17.1 billion of capital was invested by our Private Equity business line, as compared to $13.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by a $6.4 billion increase in capital invested in our traditional private equity strategy and a $1.5 billion increase in capital invested in our growth equity strategy, partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in capital invested in our core private equity strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 58% of capital deployed in private equity was in transactions in North America, 28% was in Europe, and 14% was in the Asia-Pacific region. The number of large private equity investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods.\nReal Assets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, $27.9 billion of capital was invested by our Real Assets business line, as compared to $15.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by a $7.1 billion increase in capital invested in our real estate strategy and a $5.4 billion increase in capital invested in our infrastructure strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 55% of capital deployed in real assets was in transactions in North America, 30% was in Europe, and 15% was in the Asia-Pacific region. The number of large real assets investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods.\n169\nTable of Contents\nCredit and Liquid Strategies\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, $38.6 billion of capital was invested by our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line, as compared to $15.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by a higher level of capital deployed across our various private credit strategies, most notably asset-based finance and direct lending. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 89% of capital deployed was in transactions in North America, 9% was in Europe, and 2% was in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAnalysis of Insurance Segment Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth information regarding KKR's insurance segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nNet Investment Income\n$\n6,328,822 \n$\n5,377,817 \n$\n951,005 \nNet Cost of Insurance\n(4,448,886)\n(3,283,009)\n(1,165,877)\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\n(865,390)\n(805,109)\n(60,281)\nPre-Tax Operating Earnings\n1,014,546 \n1,289,699 \n(275,153)\nPre-Tax Operating Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n— \n(473,062)\n473,062 \nInsurance Operating Earnings\n$\n1,014,546\n \n$\n816,637\n \n$\n197,909\n \nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in the institutional market channel as a result of reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales from new business growth, and (ii) increases in portfolio yields due to portfolio optimization and asset rotation.\nNet Cost of Insurance\nNet cost of insurance increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to (i) growth in reserves in the institutional market channel as a result of recent reinsurance transactions and in the individual market channel as a result of new business volumes, and (ii) higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the routine run-off of older business originated in a lower interest rate environment.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest expense due to a net increase in total debt outstanding.\nInsurance Operating Earnings\nInsurance operating earnings increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining minority interests of Global Atlantic not already held by KKR on January 2, 2024.

This increase was partially offset by (i) a lower level of management fees from Americas Fund XII due to a step-down in the management fee rate in 2023 and a decrease in invested capital, (ii) management fees earned on new capital raised for North America Fund XIII in the first quarter of 2022 that were retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period, and (iii) a lower level of management fees from Asian Fund III due to a decrease in its fee base, which had invested capital reduced from the sale of investments. There were no management fees that were retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period for the year ended December 31, 2023 for North America Fund XIII. During the fourth quarter of 2023, approximately $14.9 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the relevant fund's investment period.\nThe increase in Real Assets management fees was primarily attributable to (i) management fees earned from Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors II for the full year 2023, which entered its investment period in the third quarter of 2022, (ii) a higher level of management fees earned from Global Atlantic due to an increase in their assets being managed by our asset management segment, and (iii) management fees earned from Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund due to an increase in its fee base, due to higher capital inflows and investment appreciation year over year. This increase was partially offset by a lower level of management fees from our first Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors fund in the current year as a result of entering its post-investment period in the third quarter of 2022 and, consequently, management fees being earned on invested capital rather than committed capital. During the fourth quarter of 2023, approximately $4.7 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the relevant fund's investment period.\n173\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in Credit and Liquid Strategies management fees was primarily attributable to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from Global Atlantic due to an increase in assets being managed by our asset management segment, (ii) a higher level of management fees earned from Marshall Wace, and (iii) the issuance of various U.S. and European CLOs over the last twelve months. The increase was partially offset by a lower level of management fees from certain SIG funds primarily due to (i) a decrease in its fee base from the sale of investments and (ii) the waiver of fees on certain SIG funds.\nTransaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\nThe following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange\n($ in thousands)\nTransaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\nPrivate Equity\n$\n115,276 \n$\n120,410 \n$\n(5,134)\nReal Assets\n20,564 \n33,202 \n(12,638)\nCredit and Liquid Strategies\n7,197 \n22,018 \n(14,821)\nCapital Markets\n577,617 \n600,303 \n(22,686)\nTotal Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net\n$\n720,654\n \n$\n775,933\n \n$\n(55,279)\nThe decrease in transaction and monitoring fees, net is primarily due to a lower level of transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line. The decrease in capital markets transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the size of capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Overall, we completed 239 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which 45 represented equity offerings and 194 represented debt offerings, as compared to 240 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2022, of which 29 represented equity offerings and 211 represented debt offerings. We earn fees in connection with underwriting, syndication, and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes.\nOur capital markets fees are generated in connection with activity involving our private equity, real assets, and credit funds as well as from third-party companies. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 13% of our transaction fees in our Capital Markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 14% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 39% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 46% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.\nTransaction and monitoring fees, net were lower for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year across our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines primarily due to the decrease in transaction activity resulting in a decline in the level of capital invested year over year.

Partially offsetting the increase was distributions to fund investors primarily as a result of realized proceeds, most notably from Americas Fund XII, our core private equity strategy, and Asian Fund III.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the value of our traditional private equity investment portfolio increased by 16%.

These increases in value were partially offset by decreases in value relating primarily to various assets held in our opportunistic real estate equity investment portfolio and energy portfolio. The increased valuations of individual companies or assets in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company or asset performance and (ii) a decrease in interest rates which reduced the cost of capital in our discounted cash flow methodology for certain valuations. The decreased valuations of individual companies or assets in the aggregate, generally related to an increase in capitalization rates and discount rates which generally negatively impacted our real estate equity portfolio, and a decrease in oil and natural gas prices, which generally negatively impact our energy portfolio.

Within these categories, 94%, 96%, and 90% of Global Atlantic's Corporate, RMBS, and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NAIC ratings, and 94%, 74%, and 59% of its Corporate, RMBS, and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NRSRO ratings as of December 31, 2024. The three largest asset categories in Global Atlantic's AFS fixed maturity security portfolio as of December 31, 2023, were Corporate, RMBS, and CMBS securities, comprising 28%, 6%, and 5% of Global Atlantic's investment portfolio, respectively. Within these categories, 95%, 96%, and 93% of Global Atlantic's Corporate, RMBS, and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NAIC ratings, and 95%, 61%, and 56% of its Corporate, RMBS, and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NRSRO ratings as of December 31, 2023. NRSRO and NAIC ratings have different methodologies. Global Atlantic believes the NAIC ratings methodology, which considers the likelihood of recovery of amortized cost as opposed to the recovery of all contractual payments including the principal at par, as the more appropriate way to view the ratings quality of its AFS fixed maturity portfolio since a large portion of its holdings were purchased at a significant discount to par value. The portion of Global Atlantic's investment portfolio consisting of floating rate assets was 25% and 27% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWithin the funds withheld receivable at interest portfolio, 97% of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade by NAIC designation as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTrading fixed maturity securities back funds withheld payable at interest where the investment performance is ceded to reinsurers under the terms of the respective reinsurance agreements.\nCredit Quality of AFS Fixed Maturity Securities\nThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the AFS fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called “NAIC designations.” Using an internally developed rating is permitted by the NAIC if no rating is available. These designations are generally similar to the credit quality designations of NRSROs for marketable fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. NAIC designations of “1,” highest quality, and “2,” high quality, include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade by NRSROs. NAIC designations “3” through “6” include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade by NRSROs.\nConsistent with the NAIC Process and Procedures Manual, a NRSRO rating was assigned based on the following criteria: (i) the equivalent S&P rating where the security is rated by one NRSRO; (ii) the equivalent S&P rating of the lowest NRSRO when the security is rated by two NRSROs; and (iii) the equivalent S&P rating of the second lowest NRSRO if the security is rated by three or more NRSROs. If the lowest two NRSROs’ ratings are equal, then such rating will be the assigned rating. NRSROs’ ratings available for the periods presented were S&P, Fitch, Moody’s, DBRS, Inc., and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nSubstantially all of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, 95% and 96% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was invested in investment grade assets with a NAIC rating of 1 or 2.\nThe portion of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio that was considered below investment grade by NAIC designation was 5% and 4% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Pursuant to Global Atlantic's investment guidelines, Global Atlantic actively monitors the percentage of its portfolio that is held in investments rated NAIC 3 or lower and must obtain an additional approval from Global Atlantic's management investment committee before making a significant investment in an asset rated NAIC 3 or lower.\n187\nTable of Contents\nCorporate Fixed Maturity Securities\nGlobal Atlantic maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities across industries and issuers. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 55% and 58% of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in corporate fixed maturity securities, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 5% and 6% of the portfolio is denominated in foreign currency, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 94% and 95% of the total fair value of corporate fixed maturity securities is rated NAIC investment grade, respectively, and 94% and 95% is rated NRSROs investment grade, respectively.\nResidential Mortgage-backed Securities\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 13% and 11% of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in RMBS, respectively. RMBS are securities constructed from pools of residential mortgages and backed by payments from those pools. Excluding limitations on access to lending and other extraordinary economic conditions, Global Atlantic would expect prepayments of principal on the underlying loans to accelerate with decreases in market interest rates and diminish with increases in market interest rates.\nThe NAIC designations for RMBS, including prime, sub-prime, alt-A, and adjustable rate mortgages with variable payment options (\"Option ARM\"), are based upon a comparison of the bond’s amortized cost to the NAIC’s loss expectation for each security. Accordingly, an investment in the same security at a lower cost may result in a higher quality NAIC designation in recognition of the lower likelihood the investment would result in a realized loss. Prime residential mortgage lending includes loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime, which also includes certain non-qualified mortgages. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the business of originating residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weaker credit profiles.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 84% and 89% of RMBS securities that are below investment grade as rated by the NRSRO, carry an NAIC 1 (\"highest quality\") designation, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Alt-A, Agency, Option ARM, Sub-prime, and Re-Performing represent 44%, 20%, 15%, 8%, and 6% of the total RMBS portfolio ($10.3 billion), respectively. As of December 31, 2023, Alt-A, Option ARM, Re-Performing, and Sub-prime represent 45%, 21%, 10%, and 10% of the total RMBS portfolio ($7.9 billion), respectively.\nUnrealized Gains and Losses for AFS Fixed Maturity Securities\nGlobal Atlantic's investments in AFS fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes and offsets. Unrealized gains and losses can be created by changes in interest rates or by changes in credit spreads.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Global Atlantic had gross unrealized losses on below investment grade AFS fixed maturity securities of $584.3 million and $750.3 million based on NRSRO ratings, and $245.6 million and $267.2 million based on NAIC ratings, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, unrealized losses were not recognized in net income on these fixed maturity securities since Global Atlantic neither intends to sell the securities nor does it believe that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost or amortized cost basis. \nCredit Quality of Mortgage and Other Loan Receivables\nMortgage and other loan receivables consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and other loan receivables. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 31% and 28% of Global Atlantic's total investments consisted of mortgage and other loan receivables, respectively. \nGlobal Atlantic invests in U.S. mortgage loans, comprised of first lien and mezzanine commercial mortgage loans and first lien residential mortgage loans. For Global Atlantic’s commercial mortgage loan portfolio, the most prevalent property type is multi-family residential buildings, which represents approximately half of the portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and over half of the portfolio as of December 31, 2023. Office and retail properties represent approximately 20% and 23% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGlobal Atlantic's commercial mortgage loans are assigned NAIC designations, with designations “CM1” and “CM2” considered to be investment grade. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 91% and 89% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio were rated investment grade based on NAIC designation, respectively. The payment status of over 99% and over 98% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is current as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n188\nTable of Contents\nThe loan-to-value ratio is expressed as a percentage of the current amount of the loan relative to the value of the underlying collateral. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 90% and 88%, respectively, of the commercial mortgage loans have a loan-to-value ratio of 70% or less and 1% and 2% have loan-to-value ratio over 90%, respectively.\nChanging economic conditions and updated assumptions affect Global Atlantic’s assessment of the collectibility of commercial mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the analysis that Global Atlantic performs to measure the allowance for credit losses. In addition, Global Atlantic continuously monitors its commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have exposure to specific geographic events or have deteriorating credit.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the payment status of 97% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio is current, and approximately $275.1 million is 90 days or more past due or in process of foreclosure (representing 1% of the total residential mortgage portfolio). As of December 31, 2023, the payment status of 96% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was current and approximately $231.2 million were 90 days or more past due or in process of foreclosure (representing 2% of the total residential mortgage portfolio).\nThe weighted average loan-to-value ratio for residential mortgage loans was 63% as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nGlobal Atlantic's residential mortgage loan portfolio primarily includes mortgage loans backed by single family rental properties, prime loans, and re-performing loans that were purchased at a discount after they were modified and returned to performing status. Global Atlantic has also extended financing to counterparties in the form of repurchase agreements secured by mortgage loans, including performing and non-performing mortgage loans. \nGlobal Atlantic’s consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of home improvement loans, residential solar loans, student loans, and auto loans. As of December 31, 2024, 98% of the consumer loan portfolio is in current status and approximately $26.9 million is 90 days or more past due or in process of foreclosure (representing 1% of the total consumer loan portfolio).\nAdditional Information\nTo provide supplemental information to stockholders about the net assets of KKR on a segment basis, KKR’s book value was $31.1 billion as of December 31, 2024, which included cash and short-term investments of $4.2 billion. KKR's book value includes its net investment in Global Atlantic, investments in the Asset Management and Strategic Holdings segments, and the net impact of certain other assets and liabilities, including income taxes. KKR's book value excludes the net assets allocable to investors in KKR’s investment funds and other noncontrolling interest holders.  \n189\nTable of Contents\nReconciliations to GAAP Measures \nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co.

The overall liquidity framework and cash management approach of our insurance business are also based on seeking to build an investment portfolio that is cash flow matched, providing cash inflows from insurance assets that meet our insurance companies' expected cash outflows to pay their liabilities. Our primary cash flow activities typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends), as well as through the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and CLOs; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products, and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets, and businesses; (v) underwriting and funding capital commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our stockholders and any holders of our preferred stock, if any; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments, and repayments under credit agreements, our senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowing arrangements. See \"—Liquidity,\" \"—Liquidity Needs,\" and \"—Dividends and Stock Repurchases.\" \nSee \"Risk Factors\" and \"—Business Environment\" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuations.\nSources of Liquidity \nOur primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in CLOs; (iv) in our insurance business, cash inflows in respect of new premiums, policyholder deposits, reinsurance transactions, and funding agreements, including through memberships in FHLBs; (v) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments or other assets for fund formations (including CLOs and other investment vehicles); and (vi) borrowings, including advances under our revolving credit facilities, debt offerings, repurchase agreements, and other borrowing arrangements. In addition, we may generate cash proceeds from issuances of our or our subsidiaries' equity securities.\nMany of our investment funds like our private equity and real assets funds provide for carried interest. With respect to our carry-paying investment funds, carried interest is eligible to be distributed to the general partner of the fund only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. Even after all of the preceding conditions are met, the general partner of the fund may, in its sole discretion, decide to defer the distribution of carried interest to it to a later date. In addition, these funds generally include what is called a “clawback” provision, which provides that the general partner must return any carried interest that is paid in excess of what the general partner is entitled to receive at the end of the term of the fund, as discussed further below.\nAs of December 31, 2024, certain of our investment funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a \"netting hole.\" When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. A fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. Strategic investor partnerships with fund investors may require netting across the various funds in which they invest, which may reduce the carried interest we otherwise would have earned if such fund investors were to have invested in our funds without the existence of the strategic investor partnership. \n192\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, netting holes in excess of $50 million existed at North America Fund XI and Health Care Strategic Growth Fund in the amounts of $112 million and $64 million, respectively. In accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. There are also investment funds that are not accruing carried interest and do not have a netting hole although they may be in a clawback position. If the investment fund has distributed carried interest, but subsequently does not have sufficient value to provide for the distribution of carried interest at the end of the life of the investment fund, the general partner is typically required to return previously distributed carried interest to the fund investors. Although our current and former employees who received distributions of carried interest subject to clawback are required to return them to KKR, it is KKR’s obligation to return carried interest subject to clawback to the fund investors. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $546 million of carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry-paying funds and their alternative investment vehicles were liquidated at their December 31, 2024 fair values. As of December 31, 2024, Asian Fund II is the only investment fund with a clawback obligation in excess of $50 million. See Note 24 \"Commitments and Contingencies—Contingent Repayment Guarantees\" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. See also the negative amounts included in the Carried Interest column in the table included in this Item 1 in “Asset Management—Private Equity” for further information on clawback obligations.\nWe have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. \nFor a discussion of our debt obligations, including our debt securities, revolving credit agreements and loans, see Note 16 \"Debt Obligations\" in our financial statements.\nLiquidity Needs\nWe expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to meet various obligations, including, without limitation, to:\n•\ncontinue to support and grow our asset management business, including seeding new investment strategies, supporting capital commitments made by our investment vehicles to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies and otherwise supporting the investment vehicles that we sponsor;\n•\ncontinue to support and grow our insurance business;\n•\ncontinue to support and grow our strategic holdings business;\n•\ngrow and expand our businesses generally, including by acquiring or launching new, complementary, or adjacent businesses;\n•\nwarehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, accounts or CLOs or other investment vehicles pending the contribution of committed capital by the fund investors in such investment vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs;\n•\nservice debt obligations including the payment of obligations at maturity, on interest payment dates or upon redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities, including from litigation, that may give rise to future cash payments, including funding requirements to levered investment vehicles or structured transactions;\n•\nfund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including for litigation matters and guarantees;\n•\npay corporate income taxes and other taxes;\n•\npay policyholders and amounts in our insurance business related to investment, reinvestment, reinsurance, or funding agreement activity;\n•\npay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement;\n•\npay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our common stock or the terms of our preferred stock, if any;\n•\nunderwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds, and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business;\n193\nTable of Contents\n•\npost or return collateral in respect of derivative contracts;\n•\nacquire other assets (including businesses, investments, and other assets) for our businesses, some of which may be required to satisfy regulatory requirements for our capital markets business or risk retention requirements for CLOs (to the extent they may apply); \n•\naddress capital needs of regulated subsidiaries as well as non-regulated subsidiaries; and\n•\nrepurchase shares of our common stock or retire equity awards pursuant to the share repurchase program or repurchase or redeem other securities issued by us.\nFor a discussion of KKR's share repurchase program, see Note 22 \"Equity\" in our financial statements.\nCapital Commitments\nThe agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with the asset allocation strategy in our Principal Activities business line, and in our Strategic Holdings segment.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, KKR had unfunded commitments consisting of $11.0 billion to its investment funds and other investment vehicles across Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines. These unfunded commitments include $3.0 billion of uncalled capital commitments to certain investment vehicles in connection with investments in the core private equity strategy. These unfunded commitments also include funding requirements to levered investment vehicles and structured transactions to fund or otherwise be liable for a portion of the vehicle's investment losses and/or to provide the vehicle with liquidity upon certain termination events. \nIn addition to these uncalled commitments and funding obligations to KKR's investment funds and investment vehicles, KKR has entered into contractual commitments primarily with respect to underwriting transactions, debt financing, revolving credit facilities, and equity syndications in our Capital Markets business line. As of December 31, 2024, these capital markets commitments amounted to $0.7 billion. Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such capital markets commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. From time to time, we fund these various capital markets commitments noted above in our capital markets business by drawing all or substantially all of our availability for borrowings under our available credit facilities available for our Capital Markets business line. We generally expect these borrowings by our capital markets business to be repaid promptly as these commitments are syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment. Additionally, KKR's capital markets business has arrangements with third parties, which are expected to reduce KKR's risk under certain circumstances when underwriting certain debt transactions. As a result, our unfunded capital markets commitments as of December 31, 2024 have been reduced to reflect the amount expected to be funded by such third parties. As of December 31, 2024, KKR's capital markets business line has entered into such arrangements representing a total notional amount of $4.5 billion. For more information about our Capital Markets business line's risks, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our capital markets activities expose us to material risks\" in this report. \nTax Receivable Agreement\nOn May 30, 2022, KKR terminated the tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings other than with respect to exchanges of KKR Holdings Units completed prior to such date. As of December 31, 2024, an undiscounted payable of $379.0 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed for certain exchanges of KKR Holdings Units that took place prior to the termination of the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $103.9 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement since inception.\n194\nTable of Contents\nDividends and Stock Repurchases \nA dividend of $0.175 per share of our common stock has been declared and will be paid on February 28, 2025 to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on February 14, 2025.\nWhen KKR & Co. Inc. receives distributions from KKR Group Partnership, holders of exchangeable securities receive their pro rata share of such distributions from KKR Group Partnership. \nThe declaration and payment of dividends to our common stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. We announced on February 4, 2025 that our current dividend policy will be to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an annual aggregate amount of $0.74 per share (or a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per share) beginning with the dividend announced with the results of the quarter ended March 31, 2025. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including KKR’s future financial performance and other considerations that the Board of Directors deems relevant, and compliance with the terms of KKR & Co. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and applicable law. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay (including dividends on our preferred stock) generally will be treated as qualified dividend income for U.S. individual stockholders to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that future dividends will be made as intended or at all or that any particular dividend policy for our common stock will be maintained. Furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by KKR Group Partnership and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements.\nSince 2015, KKR has repurchased, or retired equity awards representing, a total of 93.1 million shares of common stock for $2.6 billion, which equates to an average price of $28.32 per share. For further information, see \"Part II—Item 5—Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\" \n195\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds and CFEs enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. Contractual arrangements include (1) commitments to fund the purchase of investments or other assets (including obligations to fund capital commitments as the general partner of our investment funds) or to fund collateral for derivative transactions or otherwise, (2) obligations arising under our senior notes, subordinated notes, and other indebtedness, (3) commitments by our capital markets business to underwrite transactions or to lend capital, (4) obligations arising under insurance policies written, (5) other contractual obligations, including servicing agreements with third-party administrators for insurance policy administration, and (6) commitments to fund the business, operations or investments of our subsidiaries.  In addition, we may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future.  For more information about these contingent liabilities, please see Note 24 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in our financial statements.\nThe following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2024 excluding consolidated funds and CFEs with a reconciliation of such amounts to anticipated future cash payments by us (including Global Atlantic) and our consolidated funds and CFEs.\n \nPayments due by Period\nTypes of Contractual Obligations\n<1 Year\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\n>5 Years\nTotal\n \n($ in millions)\nAsset Management & Strategic Holdings\nUncalled Commitments to Investment Funds \n(1)\n$\n10,968.7 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n10,968.7 \nDebt Payment Obligations \n(2)\n31.8 \n231.4 \n2,022.3 \n6,290.4 \n8,575.9 \nInterest Obligations on Debt Payment Obligations \n(3)\n387.0 \n651.4 \n620.8 \n3,724.2 \n5,383.4 \nUnderwriting Commitments \n(4)\n501.6 \n— \n— \n— \n501.6 \nLending Commitments \n(5)\n167.5 \n— \n— \n— \n167.5 \nPurchase Commitments \n(6)\n55.4 \n— \n— \n— \n55.4 \nLease Obligations\n51.6 \n153.9 \n137.3 \n584.5 \n927.3 \nInsurance \n(7)\nPolicy Liabilities \n(8)\n20,094.2 \n41,886.9 \n40,886.8 \n132,737.1 \n235,605.0 \nDebt Payment Obligations \n(9)\n— \n— \n500.0 \n3,400.0 \n3,900.0 \nInterest Obligations on Debt Payment Obligations \n(10)\n229.6 \n498.3 \n510.4 \n3,993.8 \n5,232.1 \nPurchase and Lease Commitments \n(11)\n54.4 \n87.3 \n49.2 \n344.2 \n535.1 \nTotal Contractual Obligations of KKR\n$\n32,541.8 \n$\n43,509.2 \n$\n44,726.8 \n$\n151,074.2 \n$\n271,852.0 \n(+) Uncalled Commitments of Consolidated Funds \n(12)\n17,887.0 \n— \n— \n— \n17,887.0 \n(+) Debt Payment Obligations of Consolidated Funds, CFEs and Other \n(13)  \n- Asset Management & Strategic Holdings \n3,195.9 \n901.1 \n1,189.2 \n31,921.6 \n37,207.8 \n(+) Corporate Real Estate Borrowings \n(14)\n490.0 \n— \n— \n— \n490.0 \n(+) Interest Obligations of Consolidated Funds, CFEs and Other \n(15)\n- Asset Management & Strategic Holdings\n2,197.6 \n3,908.5 \n3,743.1 \n8,775.7 \n18,624.9 \n(+) Debt and Interest Payment Obligations of Consolidated Special Purpose Vehicles - Insurance\n5.7 \n77.8 \n— \n— \n83.5 \nTotal Consolidated Contractual Obligations\n$\n56,318.0 \n$\n48,396.6 \n$\n49,659.1 \n$\n191,771.5 \n$\n346,145.2 \n(1)\nThese uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See \"—Liquidity Needs\" and Note 16 \"Debt Obligations\" in our financial statements.\n(2)\nAmounts include senior notes and subordinated notes issued by KKR and its subsidiaries. KFN's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of KFN.\n(3)\nThese interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the term of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2024, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.\n(4)\nRepresents various commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities and other financial instruments. These commitments are shown net of amounts syndicated.\n196\nTable of Contents\n(5)\nRepresents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities.\n(6)\nRepresents commitments of KKR's asset management business line including KFN to fund the purchase of various investments.\n(7)\nGlobal Atlantic has other obligations related to collateral payable held for derivative instruments ($157.8 million) and outstanding commitments to make investments in commercial mortgage loans, other lending facilities, and real asset investments ($3.1 billion) which have not been included in the above table as the exact timing of these payments cannot be estimated. Global Atlantic's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of Global Atlantic.\n(8)\nPolicy liabilities for insurance obligations consist of amounts required to meet future obligations for future policy benefits and policy account balances. Amounts presented in the table represent estimated cash payments under such contracts, including significant assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums, mortality, lapse, renewal, withdrawal, and annuitization comparable with actual experience. These assumptions also include market growth and policy crediting. All estimated cash payments are not discounted to present value. Accordingly, the total of cash flows presented for all years of $235.6 billion significantly exceeds total policy liabilities of $185.2 billion recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2024. Estimated cash payments are also presented gross of reinsurance. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could differ materially from actual results.\n(9)\nThe payments due by period for debt obligations reflect the contractual maturities of principal. \n(10)\nReflects estimated future interest payments. Future interest on variable rate debt (which includes borrowings under Global Atlantic's revolving credit facility and the subordinated debentures) was computed using prevailing rates as of December 31, 2024 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. Future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations.\n(11)\nReflects operational servicing agreements with third-party administrators for policy administration.\n(12)\nRepresents uncalled commitments of our consolidated funds excluding KKR's portion of uncalled commitments as the general partner of the respective funds. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See \"—Liquidity Needs\" and Note 16 \"Debt Obligations\" in our financial statements.\n(13)\nAmounts include (i) financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of providing liquidity to the funds of $7.2 billion, (ii) debt securities issued by our consolidated CLOs of $27.2 billion and (iii) borrowings collateralized by fund investments, fund co-investments and other assets held by levered investment vehicles of $2.8 billion. Debt securities issued by consolidated CLO entities are supported solely by the investments held at the CLO vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Borrowings by levered investment vehicles are supported solely by the investments held at the investment vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Obligations under financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro rata equity interest in such funds. Our management companies bear no obligations to repay any financing arrangements at our consolidated funds.\n(14)\nRepresents a debt obligation in connection with the ownership of KKR office space. \n(15)\nThe interest obligations on debt of our CFEs and other borrowings represent estimated interest to be paid over the term of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2024, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.\nThe commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. See \"—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement\" in this report and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure—We will be required to pay certain principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from historical exchanges of our common stock for KKR Group Partnership Units\" in this report. \nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business.\n197\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, investment income (loss) and income taxes during the reporting periods. Such estimates include but are not limited to (i) the valuation of investments and financial instruments, (ii) the determination of the income tax provision, (iii) the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, (iv) the impairment of available-for-sale investments, (v) the valuation of insurance policy liabilities, including market risk benefits, (vi) the valuation of embedded derivatives in policy liabilities and funds withheld, (vii) the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and (viii) amortization of deferred revenues and expenses associated with the insurance business. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. \nFor a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in our financial statements included in this report. \nBasis of Accounting\nWe consolidate the financial results of KKR Group Partnership and its consolidated entities, which include the accounts of our investment advisers, broker-dealers, Global Atlantic’s insurance companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated investment funds, general partners of consolidated investment funds and their respective consolidated investment funds, and certain other entities including CFEs.\nWhen an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows, and other amounts, on a gross basis. While the consolidation of an investment fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of Net Income Attributable to KKR or KKR's stockholders' equity that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under GAAP. This is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe presentations in the consolidated statement of financial condition and consolidated statement of operations reflect the significant industry diversification of KKR by its acquisition of Global Atlantic. Global Atlantic operates an insurance business, and KKR operates an asset management business, which manages the operations of the newly-formed Strategic Holdings segment (see Note 21 \"Segment Reporting\") in our financial statements included in this report, each of which possess distinct characteristics. As a result, KKR developed a two-tiered approach for the financial statements presentation, where Global Atlantic's insurance operations are presented separately from KKR's asset management business. KKR believes that these separate presentations provide a more informative view of the consolidated financial position and results of operations than traditional aggregated presentations and that reporting Global Atlantic’s insurance operations separately is appropriate given, among other factors, the relative significance of Global Atlantic’s policy liabilities, which are not obligations of KKR (other than the insurance companies that issued them). If a traditional aggregate presentation were to be used, KKR would expect to eliminate or combine several identical or similar captions, which would condense the presentations, but would also reduce the level of information presented. KKR also believes that using a traditional aggregate presentation would result in no new line items compared to the two-tier presentation included in the financial statements in this report.\nIn the ordinary course of business, KKR’s Asset Management, Strategic Holdings, and Insurance businesses enter into transactions with each other, which may include transactions pursuant to their investment management agreements and financing arrangements. The borrowings from these financing arrangements are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets pledged to support such borrowings. All the investment management and financing arrangements amongst KKR segments are eliminated in consolidation.\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n198\nTable of Contents\nConsolidation\nKKR consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. For a detailed description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in our financial statements included in this report. \nAs part of its consolidation procedures, KKR evaluates: (1) whether it holds a variable interest in an entity, (2) whether the entity is a VIE, and (3) whether the KKR’s involvement would make it the primary beneficiary. The determination that KKR holds a controlling financial interest in an investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\n The assessment of whether we consolidate an investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. These judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with an investment vehicle and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: \n•\nDetermining whether our management fees, carried interests, or incentive fees represent variable interests - We make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. In making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the VIE. \n•\nDetermining whether a legal entity qualifies as a VIE - For those entities where KKR holds a variable interest, management determines whether each of these entities qualifies as a VIE and, if so, whether or not KKR is the primary beneficiary. The assessment of whether the entity is a VIE is generally performed qualitatively, which requires judgment. These judgments include: (a) determining whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the economic performance of the entity, (c) determining whether two or more parties’ equity interests should be aggregated, and (d) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity. Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities. Under the voting interest entity model, KKR consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest. \n•\nConcluding whether KKR has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE - As there is no explicit threshold in GAAP to define “potentially significant,” we must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met.\nChanges to these judgments could result in a change in the consolidation conclusion for a legal entity.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. \nGAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value.  Investments and other financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\nLevel I\nPricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. \nLevel II\nPricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies.\n199\nTable of Contents\nLevel III\nPricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. The valuation of our Level III investments at December 31, 2024 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n Level III Valuation Methodologies\nOur investments and financial instruments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the carried interest and investment income we realize. Additionally, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. \nAcross the total Level III private equity investment portfolio (including core private equity investments), and including investments in both consolidated and unconsolidated investment funds, approximately 60% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of this Level III private equity investment portfolio (including core private equity investments) is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2024, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology, and a methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of Level III private equity investments were 39%, 55%, and 6%, respectively.\nThere is inherent uncertainty involved in the valuation of Level III investments, and there is no assurance that, upon liquidation, KKR will realize the values reflected in our valuations. Our valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. See \"Risk Factors\" and \"—Business Environment\" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results, and valuations. \nKey unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our Level III valuations as described above are included in Note 9 \"Fair Value Measurements\" in our financial statements.\nLevel III Valuation Process\nThe valuation process involved for Level III measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review.\nFor private equity and real asset investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies, and other factors. KKR begins its procedures to determine the fair values of its Level III assets approximately one month prior to the end of a reporting period, and KKR follows additional procedures to ensure that its determinations of fair value for its Level III assets are appropriate as of the relevant reporting date. These preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations annually for all Level III private equity and real asset investments and quarterly for investments other than certain investments, which have values less than preset value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 1% of the total value of KKR's Level III private equity and real asset investments. The valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by independent valuation firms without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firms rely on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. For credit investments, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by KKR to assist with the valuations of most investments classified as Level III. The valuation firm either provides a value, provides a valuation range from which KKR's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the valuation, or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations. After reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted for review and approval by KKR's valuation committees. As of December 31, 2024, less than 5% of the total value of our Level III credit investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm.\n200\nTable of Contents\nFor Level III investments in Asset Management and Strategic Holdings, KKR has a Global Valuation Committee that is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. The Global Valuation Committee is assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees that exist for private equity (including core equity investments and certain impact investments), growth equity (including certain impact investments), real estate, energy, infrastructure, and credit. The asset class-specific valuation committees are responsible for the review and approval of all preliminary Level III valuations in their respective asset classes on a quarterly basis. The members of these valuation committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance, and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments. All Level III valuations for investments in Asset Management and Strategic Holdings are also subject to approval by the Global Valuation Committee, which is comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes KKR's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer. Once Level III valuations are approved by the Global Valuation Committee, a presentation of such valuations is provided to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and then to the Board of Directors.\nLevel III investments held by Global Atlantic are valued using either pricing services, broker-dealers, third-party asset managers, or internal models. Global Atlantic's valuation committee performs a quantitative and qualitative analysis over all pricing sources used to verify that it represents a reasonable estimate of fair value. As of December 31, 2024, less than 5% of the total value of Global Atlantic's Level III investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm. Once Level III valuations are approved by Global Atlantic Valuation Committee, these valuations are presented to the Global Valuation Committee, and then a presentation of such valuations is provided to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and then to the Board of Directors.\nAs of December 31, 2024, upon completion by, where applicable, independent valuation firms of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain Level III investments, the independent valuation firms concluded that the fair values, as determined by KKR (including Global Atlantic), of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all Level III investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. \nAs described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs, and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and stockholders' equity that we report from time to time.\nChanges in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly in Asset Management, Strategic Holdings, and through our consolidated funds as described below. We estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of carried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. With respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our ownership in the consolidated investment funds and investment vehicles.  With respect to Insurance, a decrease in investment income for certain assets where investment gains and losses are recognized through the statement of operations would impact KKR only to the extent of our economic ownership interest in Global Atlantic.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were no investments (including in our new Strategic Holdings segment) which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a GAAP basis. Our investment income on a GAAP basis and our asset management segment assets can be impacted by volatility in the public markets related to our holdings of publicly traded securities, including our holdings of equity securities of Crescent Energy Company (NYSE: CRGY) and BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. See \"Risk Factors\" and \"—Business Environment\" for a discussion of factors that may impact the valuations of our investments, financial results, operating results, and valuations, and \"—Segment Balance Sheet Measures\" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a segment basis.\n201\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations\nKKR accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. \nManagement’s determination of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date is based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involve a significant degree of judgment. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and outflows, future fundraising assumptions, expected useful life, discount rates, and income tax rates. Our estimates for future cash flows are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying assets acquired. We estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit from the asset. We base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual result.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties, and uncertain tax positions. In evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that KKR uses to manage its business. Revisions in estimates or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. Please see Note 18 \"Income Taxes\" in our financial statements in this report for further details. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Asset Management and Strategic Holdings\nRevenues\nFees and Other\nFees and other consist primarily of (i) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, CLOs, other investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts; (ii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities; (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies; (iv) expense reimbursements from certain investment funds and portfolio companies; and (v) consulting fees. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.\nTransaction fee calculations and management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital typically do not require discretion and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the investment vehicles. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions.\nCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)\nCapital allocation-based income (loss) is earned from those arrangements whereby KKR serves as general partner and includes income or loss from KKR's capital interest as well as \"carried interest\" which entitles KKR to a disproportionate allocation of investment income or loss from an investment fund's limited partners. \n202\nTable of Contents\nCarried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds’ investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in their partnership agreement.  KKR recognizes revenues attributable to capital allocation-based income based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date. Accordingly, the amount recognized reflects KKR’s share of the gains and losses of the associated funds’ underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. Because of the inherent uncertainty in measuring the fair value of investments in the absence of observable market prices as previously discussed, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. \nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and Benefits expense includes (i) base cash compensation consisting of salaries and wages, (ii) benefits, (iii) carry pool allocations, (iv) equity-based compensation, and (v) discretionary cash bonuses.\nTo supplement base cash compensation, benefits, carry pool allocations, and equity-based compensation, we typically pay discretionary cash bonuses, which are included in Compensation and Benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations, based principally on the level of (i) management fees and other fee revenues (including incentive fees), (ii) realized carried interest, and (iii) realized investment income earned during the year. The amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our sole discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus. We accrue discretionary cash bonuses when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable which is generally in the period when we make the decision to pay discretionary cash bonuses and is based upon a number of factors, including the recognition of fee revenues, realized carried interest, realized investment income, and other factors determined during the year.\nBeginning in 2021, we expect to pay our employees by assigning a percentage range to each component of asset management segment revenues.  Prior to January 1, 2024, based on the current components and blend of our asset management segment revenues on an annual basis, we expected to use approximately: (i) 20‐25% of fee related revenues, (ii) 60‐70% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10‐20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees, to pay our asset management employees. Beginning in January 2024, we expect to use approximately: (i) 15%-20% of fee related revenues, (ii) 70%-80% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10%-20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees, to pay our asset management employees. Because these ranges are applied to applicable asset management segment revenue components independently, and on an annual basis, the amount paid as a percentage of total asset management segment revenue will vary and will, for example, likely be higher in a period with relatively higher realized carried interest and lower in a period with relatively lower realized carried interest. We decide whether to pay a discretionary cash bonus and determine the percentage of applicable revenue components to pay compensation only upon the occurrence of the realization event. There is no contractual or other binding obligation that requires us to pay a discretionary cash bonus to the asset management employees, except in limited circumstances.\nCarry Pool Allocation\nWith respect to our funds that provide for carried interest, we allocate a portion of the realized and unrealized carried interest that we earn to Associates Holdings, which we refer to as the carry pool, from which our asset management employees and certain other carry pool participants are eligible to receive a carried interest allocation. The allocation is determined based upon a fixed arrangement between Associates Holdings and us, and we do not exercise discretion on whether to make an allocation to the carry pool upon a realization event. We refer to the portion of carried interest that we allocate to the carry pool as the carry pool percentage.  \nAs of December 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 40%, 43%, or 65% by investment fund, depending on the fund’s vintage. For funds that closed after December 31, 2020 but before December 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 65%. For funds that closed after June 30, 2017 but before December 31, 2020, the carry pool percentage was fixed at 43%, and the carry pool percentage was fixed at 40% for older funds that contributed to KKR's carry pool. Effective January 2, 2024, KKR is authorized to apply a carry pool percentage in excess of these fixed percentages of up to 80% for all funds. \n203\nTable of Contents\nThis increase to the carry pool percentage was approved by a majority of KKR's independent directors, and the carry pool percentage may not be increased above 80% without the further approval of a majority of KKR's independent directors. For funds that closed after December 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage is fixed at 80%.  For funds that closed prior to December 31, 2023, the carry pool percentage is calculated at a fixed percentage of 40%, 43%, or 65% (depending on the fund’s vintage) for carried interest realized up to a high water mark, which was established based on the unrealized carried interest balance that existed on January 2, 2024, plus an additional percentage amount up to 80% based on a formulaic allocation, only if the unrealized carried interest balance at any period end exceeds the high water mark. This imposes a limitation of the carry pool allocation for such funds based on the amount of cumulative unrealized carried interest income earned subsequent to December 31, 2023. \nFor funds that closed before December 31, 2023, if the cumulative carried interest subsequent to December 31, 2023 is not sufficient to fund this formulaic allocation, the allocation of earnings reverts to the carry pool percentage in effect before this modification. As such, upon modification of the carry pool percentage effective on January 2, 2024, the cumulative unrealized carried interest was not sufficient to fund the additional formulaic allocation percentage in excess of the pre-existing 40%, 43%, and 65% carry pool percentages, and therefore no incremental expense was recognized as of such date. The carry pool percentage applicable for all funds that closed prior to December 31, 2023 will not be less than their applicable carry pool percentages of 40%, 43%, or 65% prior to December 31, 2023, and will not be more than 80%. The intent of this modification is that for all funds that closed prior to January 2, 2024, upon the final liquidation of each fund, realized carried interest distributed will equal the historical fund carry pool allocations up to the high water mark and only distributions of realized carried interest in excess of the high water mark will be distributed at 80 percent if and only if the unrealized carried interest balance at any period end exceeds the high water mark. Under no circumstance would a distribution of carried interest exceed 80% of the total allocable carried interest at any time.  \nKKR accounts for the carry pool as a compensatory profit-sharing arrangement in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities within the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and it is recorded as compensation expense. The liability that is recorded in each period reflects the legal entitlement of Associates Holdings at each point in time should the total unrealized carried interest be realized at the value recorded at each reporting date. Upon a reversal of carried interest income, the related carry pool allocation, if any, is also reversed. Accordingly, such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments.\nOn the Sunset Date (which will not be later than December 31, 2026), KKR will acquire control of Associates Holdings and will commence making decisions regarding the allocation of the carry proceeds pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of Associates Holdings.  Until the Sunset Date, our Co-Founders will continue to make decisions regarding the allocation of the carry proceeds to themselves and others, pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of Associates Holdings, provided that any allocation of carry proceeds to the Co-Founders will be on a percentage basis consistent with past practice. For additional information about the Sunset Date and the Reorganization Agreement, see Note 1 \"Organization\" in our financial statements included in this report.\nEquity-based Compensation\nIn addition to the cash-based compensation and carry pool allocations as described above, employees receive equity awards under our Equity Incentive Plans, most of which are subject to service-based vesting typically over a three to five-year period from the date of grant, and some of which are also subject to the achievement of market-based conditions. Certain of these awards are subject to post-vesting transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements.\nCompensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-based awards is measured at fair value on the grant date. In determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants, we make judgments as to the grant-date fair value, particularly for certain restricted units with a vesting condition based upon market conditions, whose grant date fair values are based on a probability distributed Monte-Carlo simulation. See Note 19 \"Equity Based Compensation,” in our financial statements included in this report for further discussion and activity of these awards.\n204\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Income (Loss) -Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities\nNet gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities as well as income earned from certain equity method investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see above \"—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Fair Value Measurements.\"\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Insurance\nPolicy Liabilities\nPolicy liabilities, or collectively, “reserves,” are the portion of past premiums or assessments received that are set aside to meet future policy and contract obligations as they become due. Interest accrues on the reserves and on future premiums, which may also be available to pay for future obligations. Global Atlantic establishes reserves to pay future policy benefits, claims, and certain expenses for its life policies and annuity contracts.\nGlobal Atlantic's reserves are estimated based on models that include many actuarial assumptions and projections. These assumptions and projections, which are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgment, including assumptions as to the levels and/or timing of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), mortality, longevity, and persistency.\nThe assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves and the assumptions underlying those reserves at least annually. Global Atlantic cannot, however, determine with precision the amount or the timing of actual benefit payments. If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves would be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required to meet future policy and contract obligations. This would result in a charge to Global Atlantic's net income during the period in which excess benefits are paid or an increase in reserves occurs.\nFor a majority of Global Atlantic's in-force policies, including its interest-sensitive life policies and most annuity contracts, the base policy reserve is equal to the account value. For these products, the account value represents Global Atlantic's obligation to repay to the policyholder the amounts held with Global Atlantic on deposit. However, there are several significant blocks of business where policy reserves, in addition to the account value, are explicitly calculated, including variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, interest-sensitive life products (including those with secondary guarantees), and preneed policies.\nMarket Risk Benefits\nMarket risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the policyholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose Global Atlantic to other-than-nominal capital market risk. Market risk benefits include certain contract features on fixed annuity and variable annuity products, including minimum guarantees to policyholders, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (\"GMDBs\"), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (\"GMWBs\"), and long-term care benefits (which are capped at the return of account value plus one or two times the account value).\nSome of Global Atlantic's variable annuity and fixed-indexed annuity contracts contain a GMDB feature that provides a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount, even if the account balance is reduced to zero. This amount is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract, the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate, the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary, or sometimes a combination of these values. If the GMDB is higher than the current account value at the time of death, Global Atlantic incurs a cost equal to the difference.\n205\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Atlantic issues fixed-indexed annuity and variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal feature. GMWB are an optional benefit where the contract owner is entitled to withdraw a maximum amount of their benefit base each year.\nOnce exercised, living benefit features provide annuity policyholders with a minimum guaranteed stream of income for life. A policyholder’s annual income benefit is generally based on an annual withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base. The benefit base is defined in the policy and is generally the initial premium, reduced by any partial withdrawals and increased by a defined percentage, formula, or index credits. Any living benefit payments are first deducted from the account value. Global Atlantic is responsible for paying any excess guaranteed living benefits still owed after the account value has reached zero.\nThe ultimate cost of these benefits will depend on the level of market returns and the level of contractual guarantees, as well as policyholder behavior, including surrenders, withdrawals, and benefit utilization. For Global Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity products, costs also include certain non-guaranteed terms that impact the ultimate cost, such as caps on crediting rates that Global Atlantic can, in its discretion, reset annually. \nSee Note 17 “Policy Liabilities” in our financial statements for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the net market risk liability balance totaled $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2024, the liability balances for market risk benefits were $816.0 million for fixed-indexed annuities and $172.6 million for variable and other annuities. The increase (decrease) to the net market risk benefit liability balance as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, instrument-specific credit risk, equity market prices, expected mortality, and expected surrenders are summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.\nAs of December 31, 2024\nFixed-indexed Annuity\nOther\n($ in thousands)\nBalance\n$\n815,981\n \n$\n172,565\n \nHypothetical Change:\n+50 bps Interest Rates\n(123,666)\n(39,752)\n-50 bps Interest Rates\n138,061 \n43,965 \n+50 bps Instrument-specific Credit Risk\n(123,432)\n(20,067)\n-50 bps Instrument-specific Credit Risk\n137,246 \n22,011 \n+10% Equity Market Prices\n(49,304)\n(43,058)\n-10% Equity Market Prices\n30,924 \n48,730 \n95% of Expected Mortality\n48,914 \n4,364 \n105% of Expected Mortality\n(45,956)\n(3,791)\n90% of Expected Surrenders\n22,103 \n1,680 \n110% of Expected Surrenders\n(20,982)\n(1,637)\nNote: Hypothetical changes to the market risk benefits liability balance do not reflect the impact of related hedges.\nPolicy Liabilities Accounted for Under a Fair Value Option\nVariable annuity contracts offered and assumed by Global Atlantic provide the contractholder with a GMDB. The liabilities for these benefits are included in policy liabilities. Global Atlantic elected the fair value option to measure the liability for certain of these variable annuity contracts valued at $277.6 million as of December 31, 2024. Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated death benefits less the present value of the GMDB fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. Global Atlantic discounts the cash flows using the U.S. Treasury rates plus an adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The change in the liabilities for these benefits is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option totaled $277.6 million. The increase (decrease) in the reserves for variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, instrument-specific credit risk, equity market prices, expected mortality, and expected surrenders are summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.\n206\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024\nVariable Annuities\n($ in thousands)\nBalance\n$\n277,557\n \nHypothetical Change:\n+50 bps Interest Rates\n(18,341)\n-50 bps Interest Rates\n19,878 \n+50 bps Instrument-specific Credit Risk\n(11,309)\n-50 bps Instrument-specific Credit Risk\n11,718 \n+10% Equity Market Prices\n(14,868)\n-10% Equity Market Prices\n17,332 \n95% of Expected Mortality\n(4,916)\n105% of Expected Mortality\n4,704 \n90% of Expected Surrenders\n94 \n110% of Expected Surrenders\n(118)\nNote: Hypothetical changes to the liability balances do not reflect the impact of related hedges.\nLiability for Future Policyholder Benefits\nA liability for future policy benefits, which is the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders, is accrued as premium revenue is recognized. The liability is estimated using current assumptions that include mortality, morbidity, lapses, and expenses. These current assumptions are based on judgments that consider Global Atlantic’s historical experience, industry data, and other factors, and are updated quarterly and the current period change in the liability is recognized as a separate component of benefit expense in the consolidated income statement. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the liability for future policy benefits totaled $11.1 billion, net of reinsurance, split between $9.5 billion associated with payout annuity products, and $1.6 billion of life and other insurance products (including assumed long-term care insurance where Global Atlantic retroceded mortality and morbidity risks to a third-party reinsurer). The increase (decrease) as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, credit spreads, expected mortality, and expected surrenders and lapses are summarized in the table below.

The policy can remain in-force, even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as contractual secondary guarantee requirements have been met. The primary risk to Global Atlantic is that the premium collected under these policies, together with the investment return Global Atlantic earns on that premium, is ultimately insufficient to pay the policyholder’s benefits and the expenses associated with issuing and administering these policies. Global Atlantic holds an additional reserve in connection with these guarantees.\n207\nTable of Contents\nThe additional reserves related to interest-sensitive life products with secondary guarantees are calculated using methods similar to those described above under “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Insurance—Policy liabilities—Market risk benefits.” The costs related to these secondary guarantees are recognized over the life of the contracts through the accrual and subsequent release of a reserve which is revalued each period. The reserve is calculated based on assessments, over a range of economic scenarios to incorporate the variability in the obligation that may occur under different environments. The change in the reserve is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the additional liability balance of primarily interest-sensitive life totaled $5.9 billion, net of reinsurance. The increase (decrease) to the additional liability balance, as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, equity market prices, annual equity growth, expected mortality, and expected surrenders are summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of the interest-sensitive life no-lapse guarantee liability balance.\nAs of December 31, 2024\nInterest-sensitive Life\n($ in thousands)\nBalance\n$\n5,905,634\n \nHypothetical Change:\n+50 bps Interest Rates\n1,617 \n-50 bps Interest Rates\n(1,611)\n+10% Equity Market Prices\n(965)\n-10% Equity Market Prices\n336 \n1% Lower Annual Equity Growth\n3,538 \n95% of Expected Mortality\n(41,157)\n105% of Expected Mortality\n40,578 \n90% of Expected Surrenders\n20,627 \n110% of Expected Surrenders\n(20,247)\nNote: Hypothetical changes to the interest-sensitive life additional liability for annuitization, death, or other insurance benefits balance do not reflect the impact of related hedges.\nEmbedded Derivatives in Policy Liabilities and Funds Withheld\nGlobal Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity, variable annuity, and indexed universal life products contain equity-indexed features, which are considered embedded derivatives and are required to be measured at fair value.\nGlobal Atlantic calculates the embedded derivative as the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using an option budget as the indexed account value growth rate. In addition, the fair value of the embedded derivative is reduced to reflect instrument specific credit risk on Global Atlantic's obligation (that is, Global Atlantic's own credit risk).\nChanges in interest rates, future index credits, instrument-specific credit risk, projected withdrawal and surrender activity, and mortality on fixed-indexed annuity and interest-sensitive life products can have a significant impact on the value of the embedded derivative.\nValuation of Embedded Derivatives – Fixed-indexed Annuities\nFixed-indexed annuity contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate of return or a market indexed strategy where interest credited is based on the performance of an index, such as the S&P 500 Index, or other indexes. The market indexed strategy is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. The fair value of the embedded derivative is computed as the present value of benefits attributable to the excess of the projected policy contract values over the projected minimum guaranteed contract values. The projections of policy contract values are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates, and policyholder behavior. The projections of minimum guaranteed contract values include the same assumptions for policyholder behavior as are used to project policy contract values. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate increased by instrument-specific credit risk tied to Global Atlantic's own credit rating. \n208\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Embedded Derivatives – Interest-sensitive Life Products\nInterest-sensitive life products allow a policyholder’s account value to grow based on the performance of certain equity indexes, which results in an embedded derivative similar to a call option. The embedded derivative related to the index is bifurcated from the host contract and measured at fair value. The valuation of the embedded derivative is the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using the option budget as the indexed account value growth rate and the guaranteed interest rate as the guaranteed account value growth rate. Present values are based on discount rate curves determined at the valuation date or issue date as well as assumed lapse and mortality rates. The discount rate equals the forecast treasury rate increased by instrument-specific credit risk tied to Global Atlantic’s own credit rating. Changes in discount rates and other assumptions such as spreads and/or option budgets can have a substantial impact on the embedded derivative.\nValuation of Embedded Derivatives in Modified Coinsurance or Funds Withheld\nGlobal Atlantic's reinsurance agreements include modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements that include terms that require payment by the ceding company of a principal amount plus a return that is based on a proportion of the ceding company’s return on a designated portfolio of assets. Because the return on the funds withheld receivable or payable is not clearly and closely related to the host insurance contract, these contracts are deemed to contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at fair value. Global Atlantic is exposed to both the interest rate and credit risk of the assets. Changes in discount rates and other assumptions can have a significant impact on this embedded derivative. The fair value of the embedded derivatives is included in the funds withheld receivable at interest and funds withheld payable at interest line items on our consolidated statement of financial condition. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded in net investment-related gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the embedded derivative liability balance totaled $5.5 billion for fixed-indexed annuities, and $491.8 million for interest-sensitive life. The increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity market prices are summarized in the table below.
