  "item1": "Item 1. Business\nOUR BUSINESS\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to do this by providing services that reduce friction in local commerce and help merchants better connect with consumers in their communities. Our primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace (our \"Marketplaces\"), and our Commerce Platform.\nOur Marketplaces operate in over 30 countries, including the United States, and account for the vast majority of our revenue today. Our Marketplaces serve three primary constituents: merchants, consumers, and the independent contractors who use our platform to generate earnings, or \"Dashers\n1\n.\"\nOur Marketplaces provide an integrated suite of services that help merchants establish an online presence, connect with consumers in their communities, and solve mission-critical challenges, such as customer acquisition, demand generation, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We typically earn a fee from merchants for the services we provide based on the size of each transaction. We also offer advertising as a value-added service through our Marketplaces to help merchants and consumer packaged goods companies increase consumer engagement and drive incremental revenue.\nConsumers access our Marketplaces through our apps and websites to discover, engage with, and purchase goods from merchants in their communities. We seek to attract and retain consumers based primarily on the selection, convenience, quality, affordability, and service we provide. We typically charge consumers fees for each transaction, inclusive of a fixed delivery fee and a service fee that varies based on the size of the transaction. Our Marketplaces also offer our consumer membership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, which aim to lower transactional friction by reducing the delivery and service fees we charge, while providing additional membership benefits. In December 2024, our Marketplaces served over 42 million monthly active users\n2\n and, as of December 31, 2024, we had over 22 million DashPass and Wolt+ members.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer our Commerce Platform, which is a suite of services that help merchants grow, run, and operate their businesses on their own channels. DoorDash Drive On-Demand and Wolt Drive (together, \"Drive\") are white-label delivery fulfillment services that generate the majority of revenue within our Commerce Platform. In addition to Drive, we also provide services within our Commerce Platform that help merchants establish online ordering, build branded mobile apps, enable tableside order and pay, and improve customer support.\nFor Dashers, our Marketplaces and Drive provide opportunities to generate income that helps them achieve their goals. Dashers choose if, when, and where to dash, which tasks to accept, as well as how frequently and for how long to dash each time they choose to do so. We typically pay Dashers based on the amount of time they are active on our platform or the number of tasks they complete and the time, distance, and desirability associated with each task. We seek to attract Dashers primarily based on the accessibility, flexibility, and earnings opportunities we provide.\nWe believe our business achieves its greatest benefits when we provide attractive services for each of our key constituents. Consequently, to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with an expanding suite of services that help them build and grow successful omnichannel businesses; consumers with a broad selection of merchants and products to choose from, consistent and high-quality experiences, and affordability that drives increased adoption; and Dashers with unique opportunities that compete effectively for their time and effort with every task.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences, fragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the following criteria:\n•\nMerchants.\n We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our business enablement and demand fulfillment services.\n1\n Dashers that use our DoorDash Marketplace and Wolt Marketplace are referred to as \"DoorDash Dashers\" and \"Wolt courier partners,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2\n Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplaces in the past month, measured as of December 31, 2024.\n6\nTable of Contents\n•\nConsumers. \nWe compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants and products available, the quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability.\n•\nDashers.\n We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our platform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, overall quality of the dashing experience, and earnings potential.\nIn particular, local food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we compete with other local on-demand delivery companies, including Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, and other local incumbents. We also compete with merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online ordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, convenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide merchant delivery services. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers. As we continue to expand into additional verticals, we may compete or come in closer competition with additional businesses with substantial resources, users, and brand power.\nFor additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “\nRisk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had over 23,700 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. Certain international employees are subject to statutory collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values that we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the future—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid innovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social progress. In 2024, 8 million people dashed\n3\n, earning a total of over $18 billion.\nWe believe access and choice are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an opportunity to earn incrementally in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors, we must compete for their time and effort with every task. We compete against other earnings opportunities, other sources of capital like loans or credit cards, as well as alternative uses of time like doing errands or leisure. Because of this competition, we must make dashing attractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices available. Specifically, we strive to make dashing positive based on: \n•\nAccessibility\n: We believe the barriers to entry in dashing are very low. Where permitted by applicable law, prospective Dashers must pass a background check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or car. People who qualify to become Dashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up. We know of no other earnings opportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\n•\nFlexibility\n: Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash for, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earnings needs. It also allows Dashers to generate earnings around other commitments in their lives, which often include full or part-time jobs, school, parenting, or commitments to care for family or friends.\n3\n Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in 2024.\n7\nTable of Contents\n•\nEarnings\n: We must provide Dashers with opportunities to earn that are competitive with alternative opportunities and commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of earnings, we provide tools that improve immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by Dashers. \n•\nService\n: We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is accessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and practices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the geographies we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the tools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2024, we had 244 issued U.S. patents, 25 patents issued in non-U.S. jurisdictions, 54 U.S. patent applications pending, and 21 patent applications pending in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2024, we held 56 registered trademarks in the United States and 194 registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending trademark applications in the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “\nRisk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation\n” and “\nRisk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation\ns.”\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, commissions and fees, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, membership services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, advertising, taxation, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. The sale and delivery of goods through our platform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety, alcohol, pharmaceuticals, controlled substances, hazardous substances, other age-restricted products, and the interstate and intrastate transport of goods. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or \n8\nTable of Contents\ninterpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, national, state, and local administrative agencies.\nSee the sections titled “\nRisk Factors\n,” including the sections titled “\n—If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, it could have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition, and results of operations\n” and “\n—Our business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased costs, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations\n”  for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nWe were incorporated in 2013 as Palo Alto Delivery Inc., a Delaware corporation.

The increase in Total Orders was driven primarily by growth in consumers and growth in average consumer engagement.\n55\nTable of Contents\nMarketplace GOV\n. We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplaces, including taxes, tips\n4\n, and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass and Wolt+. Marketplace GOV does not include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants for orders fulfilled through our Commerce Platform.\nMarketplace GOV grew to $80.2 billion in 2024, a 20% increase compared to 2023, driven primarily by growth in Total Orders.\nNet Revenue Margin.\n We define Net Revenue Margin as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV.\nNet Revenue Margin increased to 13.4% in 2024 from 12.9% in 2023, primarily due to an increased contribution from advertising revenue.\nContribution Profit.\n We define Contribution Profit as our gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off related to restructuring. Gross profit is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue.\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nContribution Profit increase\nd to $3.5 billion in 2024 from $2.5 billion in 2023, driven primarily by growth in revenue, partially offset by increases in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA.\n We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders, adjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests, and exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs), (iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory write-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest income, net, (ix) other expense, net, (x) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $1.9 billion in 2024 from $1.2 billion in 2023, driven primarily by growth in Contribution Profit, partially offset by increases in adjusted research and development expense and adjusted general and administrative expense.\nFree Cash Flow.\n We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nFree Cash Flow increased to $1.8 billion in 2024 from $1.3 billion in 2023, driven primarily by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities.\n4\n Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n56\nTable of

2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are based on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our Marketplaces to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for the use of our Marketplaces and to arrange for delivery services. \nOur revenue reflects comm\nissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which includes certain discounts and incentives provided to consumers. \nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, and our advertising products, which are recognized as part of our Marketplaces revenue. \nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including our Commerce Platform. Drive generates the majority of revenue within our Commerce Platform. We generate revenue from Drive by collecting per-order fees from merchants to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. \nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 to 2024\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2022\n2023\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nRevenue\n$\n6,583 \n$\n8,635 \n$\n10,722 \n$\n2,087 \n24 \n%\nRevenue \nincreased \nby $2.1 billion, or 24%, in 2024, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 20% increase in Marketplace GOV to $80.2 billion. In 2024, revenue grew at a faster rate than Marketplace GOV primarily due to \nan increased contribution from advertising revenue.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of rebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, insurance expenses, costs related to placing orders with non-partner merchants, and costs related to first party product sales, for which we take control of inventory, (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding merchants and Dashers, costs for providing support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform infrastructure costs, and (iii) personnel costs, which include \n58\nTable of Contents\npersonnel-related compensation expenses related to our local operations, support, and other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses primarily include salary, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.

Foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the U.S. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the U.S. \nAccordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our stock price, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit developments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and losses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses varies depending on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of any particular item is greater when the amount of our pre-tax income or loss is smaller. \nWe have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Finland. We expect to maintain these valuation allowances until it becomes more-likely-than-not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized by way of expected future taxable income in the U.S. and Finland.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 to 2024\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2022\n2023\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n$\n(31)\n$\n31 \n$\n39 \n$\n8 \n*\n*\nPercentage not meaningful\n.\nIn 2024, the income tax expense increased by $8 million compared to 2023. The increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by U.S. pre-tax book income and the resulting increase in U.S. cash tax liabilities, partially offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which a tax benefit can be realized.\nGiven our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence may become available in a future period to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of any potential valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of our level of sustained U.S. profitability, as well as the amount of our tax deductible stock-based compensation, which is dependent upon our publicly traded share price, and macroeconomic conditions, among other factors.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 – \"Income Taxes\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our business and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods and with other companies in our industry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, \n61\nTable of Contents\nadjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with their respective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, allocated overhead, and inventory write-off related to restructuring. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude allocated overhead as it is generally a fixed cost and is not directly impacted by Total Orders.

We exclude stock-based compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, transaction-related costs, as well as impairment expenses, as these costs are not indicative of our operating performance. We believe excluding such expenses provides a better period-to-period comparison of the core operating performance of our business.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of general and administrative expense to adjusted general and administrative expense:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2023\n2024\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n1,147 \n$\n1,235 \n$\n1,452 \nAdjusted to exclude the following:\nStock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense\n(313)\n(365)\n(329)\nCertain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses\n(1)\n(72)\n(162)\n(180)\nTransaction-related costs\n(68)\n(2)\n(7)\nOffice lease impairment expenses\n(2)\n— \n(83)\nAllocated overhead from cost of revenue, sales and marketing, and research and development\n67 \n69 \n83 \nAdjusted general and administrative\n$\n759 \n$\n775 \n$\n936 \n(1)\nWe exclude certain costs and expenses from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense because management believes that these costs and expenses are not indicative of our core operating performance, do not reflect the underlying economics of our business, and are not necessary to operate our business. These excluded costs and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, our historical Dasher pay model, and a settlement entered into in connection with an initiative to serve underrepresented communities, (ii) reserves and settlements or other resolutions for or related to the collection of sales, indirect, and other taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification, other labor law matters, and price controls, and (iv) donations as part of our relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\nContribution Profit\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders. It is not a financial measure of total company profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total company profitability nor imply profitability for our business. We define Contribution Profit as our gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off related to restructuring. We define gross margin as gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the same period and we define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit as a percentage of revenue for the same period.\n63\nTable of Contents\nGross profit is the most directly comparable financial measure to Contribution Profit.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders, adjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs), (iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory write-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest income, net, (ix) other expense, net, (x) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nBeginning with fiscal year 2024, we now present net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders as the most comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA and we have changed our presentation of the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders. We believe this is an important measure used by investors to assess the health and performance of our operations and that this presentation better reflects the comparison of that performance to the most comparable GAAP measure impacting DoorDash stockholders. We are continuing to show both net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. \n64\nTable of Contents\ncommon stockholders and net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests so that investors can easily compare our historical presentations.

As \n65\nTable of Contents\nof December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As amended and restated, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, as well as customary negative covenants that restrict our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, declare cash dividends or make certain other distributions, repurchase stock, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole, make investments and loans, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Company must also maintain compliance with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, no revolving loans were outstanding and $115 million and $112 million of letters of credit were issued under our revolving credit facility, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $6.2 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 billion, and short-term marketable securities of $1.3 billion and long-term marketable securities of $835 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors of $436 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and consumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities. Marketable securities consisted of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, and mutual funds.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. We have historically funded our operations from cash from operations as well as the issuance of equity securities, including in our initial public offering in December 2020. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with the available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nIn February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $876 million remained available under the repurchase authorization.\nIn February 2025, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $5.0 billion, which is inclusive of the remaining share repurchase authority of $876 million under the share repurchase program that we previously announced in February 2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our Class A common stock under this authorization. We may or may not repurchase any portion of the total authorized amount, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification initiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2022\n2023\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n367 \n$\n1,673 \n$\n2,132 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(300)\n(342)\n(444)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(375)\n(752)\n(204)\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(10)\n5 \n(35)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n(318)\n$\n584 \n$\n1,449 \nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion for \n2024\n.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our \n67\nTable of Contents\nestimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606\n.\n We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash. Revenue from our Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part of our Marketplaces. Revenue generated from DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. We also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nOur local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner merchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery facilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in facilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplaces. The consumer accesses our local commerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being transferred to the consumer as we do not have the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor do we obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as an agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to prospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and delivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We satisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s products and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\n68\nTable of Contents\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance that includes retained insurance deductibles to insure costs, including auto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expense. The estimate of our ultimate deductible obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. We use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward claim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
