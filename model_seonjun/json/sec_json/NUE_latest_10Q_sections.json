Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\n Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCertain statements made in this report, or in other public filings, press releases, or other written or oral communications made by Nucor Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1958, and its affiliates (collectively, \"Nucor\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\"), which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which we expect will or may occur in the future and may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “project,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could” and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company’s best judgment based on current information, and, although we base these statements on circumstances that we believe to be reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect the accuracy of such forward-looking information. As such, the forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may vary materially from the projected results and expectations discussed in this report. Factors that might cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) competitive pressure on sales and pricing, including pressure from imports and substitute materials; (2) U.S. and foreign trade policies affecting steel imports or exports; (3) the sensitivity of the results of our operations to general market conditions, and in particular, prevailing market steel prices and changes in the supply and cost of raw materials, including pig iron, iron ore and scrap steel; (4) the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect our cost of steel production or result in a delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling within our natural gas drilling programs; (5) critical equipment failures and business interruptions; (6) market demand for steel products, which, in the case of many of our products, is driven by the level of nonresidential construction activity in the United States; (7) impairment in the recorded value of inventory, equity investments, fixed assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets; (8) uncertainties and volatility surrounding the global economy, including excess world capacity for steel production, inflation and interest rate changes; (9) fluctuations in currency conversion rates; (10) significant changes in laws or government regulations affecting environmental compliance, including legislation and regulations that result in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our energy costs, capital expenditures and operating costs or cause one or more of our permits to be revoked or make it more difficult to obtain permit modifications; (11) the cyclical nature of the steel industry; (12) capital investments and their impact on our performance; (13) our safety performance; (14) our ability to integrate businesses we acquire; (15) the impact of any pandemic or public health situation; and (16) the risks discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nCaution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements included in this report. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as may be required by law. In evaluating forward-looking statements, these risks and uncertainties should be considered, together with the other risks described from time to time in our reports and other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report, as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Nucor’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOverview\nNucor and its affiliates manufacture steel and steel products. Nucor also produces direct reduced iron (\"DRI\") for use in its steel mills. Through The David J. Joseph Company and its affiliates (\"DJJ\"), the Company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, hot briquetted iron and DRI. Most of Nucor’s operating facilities and customers are located in North America. Nucor’s operations include international trading and sales companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the Company and others. Nucor is North America’s largest recycler, using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products.\nNucor reports its results in the following segments: steel mills, steel products and raw materials. The steel mills segment includes carbon and alloy steel in sheet, bars, structural and plate; steel trading businesses; rebar distribution businesses; and Nucor’s equity method investment in NuMit LLC. The steel products segment includes steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, insulated metal panels, steel grating, tubular products businesses, steel racking, piling products business, wire and wire mesh, overhead doors and utility towers and structures. The raw materials segment includes DJJ, primarily a scrap broker\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nand processor; Nu-Iron Unlimited and Nucor Steel Louisiana LLC (\"Nucor Steel Louisiana\"), two facilities that produce DRI used by the steel mills; and our natural gas production operations.\nThe average utilization rates of all operating facilities in the steel mills, steel products and raw materials segments were approximately 83%, 62% and 72%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2025 compared with approximately 77%, 59% and 73%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2024.\nResults of Operations\nNucor reported net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $607 million, or $2.63 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2025, which represented an increase compared to net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $250 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024.\nEarnings in the steel mills segment increased in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 due to increased metal margins and increased volumes amidst an improved demand environment compared to the prior year period. The steel products segment had similar earnings in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024, the latter of which included $40 million of losses and impairments of assets. Excluding the impairment charge, earnings in the steel products segment decreased in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to the decreased earnings of our joist and deck business and, to a lesser extent, decreased earnings of our metal buildings and rebar fabrication businesses. Earnings in the raw materials segment increased in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024. Included in the third quarter of 2024 raw materials segment’s earnings was an $83 million impairment charge related to a long-term note receivable that management determined was no longer collectible. The increase in the raw materials segment’s earnings in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 was due to the absence of any impairment charges in the third quarter of 2025 and the improved profitability of our scrap brokerage and scrap processing operations.\n \nNucor reported net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $1.37 billion, or $5.88 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2025, which represented a decrease compared to net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $1.74 billion, or $7.22 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in comparable year-to-date earnings in 2025 as compared to 2024 was caused by weaker first six months of 2025 results compared to the first six months of 2024.\n \nThe largest driver of the decrease in earnings in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 was the decreased earnings of the steel products segment. The steel products segment’s earnings decreased in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 due to lower average selling prices, with the most impactful decrease at our joist and deck business. Earnings in the steel mills segment decreased in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 due to lower average selling prices and margin compression caused by higher conversion costs, particularly in the first quarter of 2025. During the first nine months of 2025, average selling prices in the steel mills segment increased from the first quarter to the second quarter and stayed relatively flat in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. This contrasts with the trend in average selling prices for the steel mills segment in the previous year, which decreased each consecutive quarter during the first nine months of 2024. Earnings in the raw materials segment increased in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 due to the prior year nine months including the previously mentioned $83 million impairment charge and the improved profitability of our DRI facilities.\nThe following discussion provides a greater quantitative and qualitative analysis of Nucor’s performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2024.\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Sales\n \nNet sales to external customers by segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 and 2024 were as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months (13 Weeks) Ended\n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months (39 Weeks) Ended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 4, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n% Change\n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 4, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n% Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteel mills\n\n\n \n\n\n$5,152\n\n\n \n\n\n$4,460\n\n\n \n\n\n16%\n\n\n \n\n\n$15,312\n\n\n \n\n\n$14,486\n\n\n \n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteel products\n\n\n \n\n\n2,791\n\n\n \n\n\n2,496\n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n7,853\n\n\n \n\n\n7,716\n\n\n \n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw materials\n\n\n \n\n\n578\n\n\n \n\n\n488\n\n\n \n\n\n18%\n\n\n \n\n\n1,642\n\n\n \n\n\n1,456\n\n\n \n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal net sales to external customers\n\n\n \n\n\n$8,521\n\n\n \n\n\n$7,444\n\n\n \n\n\n14%\n\n\n \n\n\n$24,807\n\n\n \n\n\n$23,658\n\n\n \n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n \nNet sales for the third quarter of 2025 increased 14% from the third quarter of 2024.

In the third quarter of 2025, approximately 95% of outside sales for the raw materials segment were from the scrap brokerage operations of DJJ, and approximately 3% of outside sales were from the scrap processing operations of DJJ (approximately 93% and 3%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024).\n \nNet sales for the raw materials segment increased 13% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the first nine months of 2024, due to higher average selling prices and increased tons shipped to outside customers by the scrap brokerage operations of DJJ. In the first nine months of 2025, approximately 95% of outside sales for the raw materials segment were from the scrap brokerage operations of DJJ, and approximately 3% of outside sales were from the scrap processing operations of DJJ (approximately 93% and 4%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2024).\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nGross Margins\nNucor recorded gross margins of $1.19 billion (14%) in the third quarter of 2025, which was an increase compared to $758 million (10%) in the third quarter of 2024.\n•\nThe largest driver of the increase in gross margins in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 was higher metal margins in the steel mills segment. Metal margin is the difference between the selling price of steel and the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes.\nScrap and scrap substitutes are the most significant element in the total cost of steel production. In the steel mills segment, the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per gross ton used in the third quarter of 2025 was $391, a 3% increase compared to $378 in the third quarter of 2024. Despite the increase in scrap and scrap substitute costs in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024, total metal margin dollars increased as the increase in average selling prices and volumes outpaced the increase in scrap and scrap substitute costs.\n \nScrap prices are driven by the global supply and demand for scrap and other iron-based raw materials used to make steel. As we enter the fourth quarter of 2025, scrap prices are comparable to the third quarter of 2025.\n•\nGross margins in the steel products segment decreased in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreases at our joist and deck business, and to a lesser extent, our metal buildings and rebar fabrication businesses. \n•\nPre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities were approximately $103 million in the third quarter of 2025 and approximately $168 million in the third quarter of 2024. Pre-operating and start-up costs in the third quarter of 2025 primarily included costs related to the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia and the melt shop expansion in Arizona. Pre-operating and start-up costs in the third quarter of 2024 primarily included costs related to the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia, the plate mill in Kentucky, and the melt shop expansion in Arizona. Nucor defines pre-operating and start-up costs, all of which are expensed, as the losses attributable to facilities or major projects that are either under construction or in the early stages of operation. Once these facilities or projects have attained a utilization rate that is consistent with our similar operating facilities, Nucor no longer considers them to be in start-up.\n \n•\nGross margins in the raw materials segment increased in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to the increased earnings of our scrap brokerage and scrap processing operations.\nNucor recorded gross margins of $3.02 billion (12%) in the first nine months of 2025, which was a decrease compared to $3.48 billion (15%) in the first nine months of 2024.\n•\nThe largest driver of the decrease in gross margins in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 was the decreased earnings of the steel products segment, which was primarily due to the decreased profitability of our joist and deck businesses. \n•\nIn the steel mills segment, gross margins decreased in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 due to the previously mentioned decrease in average selling prices and higher conversion costs, particularly in the first quarter of 2025.  The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per gross ton used in the first nine months of 2025 was $396, a 1% decrease compared to $399 in the first nine months of 2024. \n•\nPre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities decreased to approximately $408 million in the first nine months of 2025 from approximately $430 million in the first nine months of 2024.  Pre-operating and start-up costs in the first nine months of both 2025 and 2024 primarily included costs related to the plate mill in Kentucky, the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia, the melt shop expansion in Arizona and the rebar micro mill in North Carolina. \n•\nGross margins in the raw materials segment increased in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to the increased earnings of our DRI operations.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nMarketing, Administrative and Other Expenses\n \nA major component of marketing, administrative and other expenses is profit sharing and other incentive compensation costs. These costs, which are based upon and fluctuate with Nucor’s financial performance, increased by $49 million in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024, and decreased by $44 million in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the third quarter of 2025 was due to the Company’s increased earnings in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in the first nine months of 2025 was due to Nucor’s decreased profitability in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024, which resulted in significantly decreased accruals related to profit sharing.\n \nLosses and Impairments of Assets\n \nIncluded in the first nine months of 2025 net earnings was $40 million of losses and impairments of assets (none in the third quarter of 2025). Those charges consisted of the following: $19 million related to the closure or repurposing of certain facilities in the steel products segment; $17 million related to the repurposing of a facility in the steel mills segment; and $4 million related to the write-off of certain assets in the raw materials segment.\n \nIncluded in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 net earnings was $123 million and $137 million, respectively, of losses and impairments of assets. The $123 million in charges recorded in the third quarter of 2024 consisted of an $83 million impairment charge related to a long-term note receivable in the raw materials segment and $40 million related to certain non-current assets, mostly property, plant and equipment, net, related to a business in the steel products segment. The remaining $14 million (recorded in the second quarter of 2024) in the first nine months of 2024 was related to the write-down of certain assets in the steel mills segment.\n \nInterest Expense (Income)\n \nNet interest expense (income) for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 and 2024 was as follows (in millions):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months (13 Weeks) Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months (39 Weeks) Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 4, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 4, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n65\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n138\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n176\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(23\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(58\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(90\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(209\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense (income), net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(33\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \nInterest expense decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 mainly due to an increase in capitalized interest.

(\"CSI\") and Nucor-JFE Steel Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (\"NJSM\"). Nucor owns a 51% controlling interest in each of NYS, CSI and NJSM. The increase in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 was due primarily to the increased earnings of NYS, combined with the decreased losses of CSI and NJSM. The increase in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the first nine months of 2024 was due primarily to the increased earnings of CSI, combined with the decreased losses of NJSM.\n \n \nProvision for Income Taxes\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”) was signed into law. Nucor reflected the enactment of the OBBBA in the second quarter of 2025 financial statements as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The impact of the OBBBA on Nucor’s provision for income taxes was immaterial.\n \nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was 22.6% compared to 22.1% for the third quarter of 2024. The expected effective tax rate for the full year of 2025 is approximately 21.8%.\n \nWe estimate that in the next 12 months our gross unrecognized tax benefits, which totaled $209 million at October 4, 2025, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as $45 million as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and the closures of examinations, substantially all of which would impact the effective tax rate.\n \nThe IRS is currently examining Nucor’s 2015, 2019, and 2020 federal income tax returns. Nucor has concluded U.S. federal income tax matters for the tax years through 2014, as well as 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021. The tax years 2022 through 2024 remain open to examination by the IRS. The 2015 through 2021 Canadian income tax returns for Nucor Rebar Fabrication Group Inc. (formerly known as Harris Steel Group Inc.) and certain related affiliates are currently under examination by the Canada Revenue Agency. The tax years 2017 through 2024 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which Nucor is subject (primarily Canada, Trinidad & Tobago, and other state and local jurisdictions).\n \nNet Earnings Attributable to Nucor Stockholders and Return on Equity\nNucor reported net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $607 million, or $2.63 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $250 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024. Net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 7.1% and 3.4% in the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n \nNucor reported net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $1.37 billion, or $5.88 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of $1.74 billion, or $7.22 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2024. Net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 5.5% and 7.4% in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Annualized return on average stockholders’ equity was 8.9% and 11.2% in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n \nOutlook\nWe expect earnings in the fourth quarter of 2025 to be lower than the third quarter of 2025. In the steel mills segment, the expected decrease is primarily due to lower overall volumes, along with lower average selling prices in our sheet mills. In the steel products segment, the expected decrease is mainly due to lower volumes. In the raw materials segment, the expected decrease is primarily due to lower realized pricing as well as planned outages at our DRI facilities.\nNucor’s largest exposure to market risk is in our steel mills and steel products segments. Our largest single customer in the third quarter of 2025 represented approximately 5% of sales and has consistently paid within terms. In the raw materials segment, we are exposed to price fluctuations related to the purchase of scrap and scrap substitutes, pig iron and iron ore. Businesses within the steel mills segment account for the majority of the raw materials segment’s sales.\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently have the highest credit ratings of any steel producer headquartered in North America, with an A- long-term rating from Standard & Poor’s, an A- long-term rating from Fitch Ratings and an A3 long-term rating from Moody’s. Our credit ratings are dependent, however, upon a number of factors, both qualitative and quantitative, and are subject to change at any time. The disclosure of our credit ratings is made in order to enhance investors’ understanding of our sources of liquidity and the impact of our credit ratings on our cost of funds.\n \nOur liquidity position as of October 4, 2025 remained strong, consisting of total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.75 billion ($4.14 billion as of December 31, 2024). Approximately $960 million of the cash and cash equivalents position at October 4, 2025, was held by our majority-owned joint ventures as compared to $970 million at December 31, 2024.\n \nCash provided by operating activities was $2.44 billion in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to $3.25 billion in the first nine months of 2024. The $811 million decrease was primarily driven by net earnings before noncontrolling interests of $1.62 billion for the first nine months of 2025, which represented a decrease of $359 million from net earnings before noncontrolling interests for the prior year period of $1.97 billion.\n \n \nChanges in operating assets and operating liabilities (exclusive of acquisitions and dispositions) used cash of $387 million in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to providing cash of $131 million in the first nine months of 2024. This $518 million change was mainly due to the change in accounts receivable using cash of $614 million during the first nine months of 2025 compared to providing cash of $47 million during the first nine months of 2024, and the change in inventories using cash of $295 million during the first nine months of 2025 compared to providing cash of $496 million during the first nine months of 2024.These changes were partially offset by the change in accounts payable providing cash of $296 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to using cash of $207 million in the first nine months of 2024, and the change in salaries, wages and related accruals providing cash of $20 million during the first nine months of 2025 compared to using cash of $314 million during the first nine months of 2024.\n \nThe current ratio was 2.8 at the end of the third quarter of 2025 and 2.5 at year-end 2024.\n \n \nCash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2025 was $2.51 billion as compared to $2.77 billion in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of $261 million. Cash used for capital expenditures of $2.62 billion in the first nine months of 2025 increased by $326 million as compared to the same period of 2024 primarily due to the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia and the construction of two manufacturing locations to expand Nucor Towers & Structures (\"NTS\"). Capital expenditures for 2025 are estimated to be approximately $3.30 billion as compared to $3.17 billion in 2024. The projects that we anticipate will have the largest capital expenditures in 2025 are the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia, the construction of two manufacturing locations to expand NTS, and the galvanizing line at our sheet mill in South Carolina. These changes were partially offset by the acquisition (net of cash acquired) of Rytec Corporation for approximately $565 million during the third quarter of 2024.\n \n \nCash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2025 was $1.27 billion as compared to $2.60 billion in the first nine months of 2024. The primary uses of cash were repayments of long-term debt of $1.01 billion in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to $5 million in the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, stock repurchases used cash of $600 million in the first nine months of 2025 as compared to $1.90 billion in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of $1.30 billion. The primary source of cash in the first nine months of 2025 was proceeds from the issuance and sale of long-term debt, net of discount to the public, of $997 million. In the first quarter of 2025, Nucor issued and sold $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.650% Notes due 2030 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.100% Notes due 2035. Net proceeds from the issuance and sale of these Notes were used to redeem all of the outstanding $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.000% Notes due 2025 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.950% Notes due 2025 (collectively, the \"2025 Notes\") pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2025 Notes.\n \nOn March 11, 2025, Nucor amended and restated its revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion and to extend its maturity date to March 11, 2030. The revolving credit facility includes only one financial covenant, which is a limit of 60% on the ratio of funded debt to total capital. In addition, the revolving credit facility contains customary non-financial covenants, including a limit on Nucor’s ability to pledge the Company’s assets and a limit on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. As of October 4, 2025, the funded debt to total capital ratio was 23.8% and we were in compliance with all non-financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. No borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of October 4, 2025.\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\n \nIn September 2025, Nucor’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Nucor’s common stock of $0.55 per share payable on November 10, 2025 to stockholders of record on September 30, 2025. This dividend is Nucor’s 210\nth\n consecutive quarterly cash dividend.\n \nIn the third quarter of 2025, the Company decided to no longer pursue a new rebar micro-mill in the Pacific Northwest region. With the recent investments made in the bar group, we believe that we can serve the Western U.S. and Canadian markets from our current footprint with superior cost and supply chain advantages\n.\n \n \nFunds provided from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and new borrowings under our existing credit facilities are expected to be adequate to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements for existing operations for at least the next 24 months. We also believe we have adequate access to capital markets for liquidity purposes."
