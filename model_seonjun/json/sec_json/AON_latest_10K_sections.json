Business\nOVERVIEW\nAon plc (which may be referred to as “Aon,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of Risk Capital and Human Capital solutions. Through our experience, global reach, and comprehensive analytics, we help clients meet rapidly changing, increasingly complex, and interconnected challenges related to risk and people. We are committed to accelerating innovation to address unmet and evolving client needs so that our clients are better informed, better advised, and able to make better decisions to protect and grow their business. Management remains focused on strengthening Aon and uniting the firm through its Aon United strategy, with capabilities delivered through Risk Capital and Human Capital and enabled by data and analytics to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.\nOur clients are in over 120 countries and include all market segments and almost every industry. This diversification of our customer base helps provide us stability in different economic scenarios that could affect specific industries, customer segments, or geographies.\nWe have continued to focus our portfolio on higher-margin, capital-light professional services businesses that have high recurring revenue streams and strong cash flow generation. We endeavor to make capital allocation decisions in order to maximize value for Aon and its shareholders.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe Company formerly operated as one reportable segment under Aon United, which included all of Aon’s operations. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, the CODM assesses the performance of the Company and allocates resources based on two segments: Risk Capital and Human Capital. This segmentation will align with how the Company addresses client needs, accelerating its Aon United strategy and maximizing value for Aon and its shareholders. Differences between the reportable segments’ results and Aon’s consolidated results include certain inter-segment revenues, as well as unallocated expenses. Prior period comparative segment information has been recast to conform with current year presentation, which reflects the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our reportable operating segment performance. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices.”\nIn 2024, our consolidated Total revenue was $15,698 million. This includes $10,517 million in Risk Capital and $5,209 million in Human Capital before certain intercompany eliminations.\nPrincipal Products and Services\nRisk Capital\nCommercial Risk Solutions \nuses Risk Capital’s extensive data and analytics capabilities to provide brokerage and consulting services that help organizations develop, improve, and implement their risk management strategies. Commercial Risk Solutions includes insurance and specialty brokerage, global risk consulting, captives management, and Affinity programs. In insurance brokerage, our dedicated teams of risk professionals utilize comprehensive analytics to design strategically resilient insurance programs and provide our clients access to Aon’s proprietary facilities, such as Aon Client Treaty and all other forms of capital, regardless of insurance carrier, placement structure or geography. Throughout the year, we review analytics specific to clients’ losses and exposures, and we evaluate new risk transfer techniques to be considered in the current market conditions. Commercial Risk Solutions is organized around industry and product, including but not limited to property, casualty, financial and professional lines, construction, transportation, energy, cyber, surety, trade credit, crisis management, transaction liability, and climate. Aon’s Global Risk Consulting and Captive Management teams use quantitative analytics to advise on the trade-offs between risk retention and risk transfer as well as to provide claims consulting and advocacy to ensure optimal financial recovery. Aon’s Affinity business collaborates with sponsored groups and other distribution channels to develop, market, and administer customized insurance programs. Commercial Risk’s global reach enables seamless client service in all geographies including Aon’s Global Broking Centers in London, Bermuda and Singapore.\nReinsurance Solutions\n includes treaty reinsurance, facultative reinsurance, Strategy and Technology Group and capital markets. Treaty reinsurance addresses underwriting and capital objectives on a portfolio level, allowing our clients to more effectively manage the combination of premium growth, return on capital, and rating agency interests on an integrated basis. This includes the development of more competitive, innovative, and efficient risk transfer options. Facultative reinsurance empowers clients to better understand, manage, and transfer risk through innovative facultative solutions and provides the most efficient access to the global facultative reinsurance markets. Strategy and Technology Group combines strategic advice with \n5\ndata-driven consulting, analytics, and modeling tools, including Tyche, ReMetrica, and PathWise, to help clients deploy capital efficiently and effectively. We develop highly customized solutions, enabled by innovative technology, that help clients drive growth and operational efficiency, improve balance sheet strength and resiliency, and comply with regulatory and operational requirements, including through the execution of reinsurance transactions. Capital markets is a global investment bank with expertise in insurance-linked securities, capital raising, strategic advice, restructuring, and mergers and acquisitions. We partner with insurers, reinsurers, investment firms, and corporations in executing innovative risk management products, capital market solutions and corporate finance advisory services.\nHuman Capital\nHealth Solutions \nincludes consulting and brokerage, consumer benefits, and talent advisory services. Consulting and brokerage develops and implements innovative, customized health and benefits strategies for our clients to manage risk, drive engagement, and strengthen their workforce through improved health and wellbeing. We partner with insurers and other strategic partners to develop and implement new and innovative solutions and leverage world-class analytics and technology to help clients make informed decisions and manage healthcare outcomes. Consulting and brokerage also advises multinational companies on global benefits programs, including program design and management, financing optimization, and enhanced employee experience, as well as assists in navigating global regulatory and compliance requirements in over 120 countries. Consumer benefits solutions designs and delivers innovative voluntary consumer benefits programs that improve an employer’s total rewards strategy and positively impacts their employees’ financial and overall wellbeing. We leverage our proprietary digital platform to provide efficient enrollment strategies through an effective combination of data, analytics, and tailored products. Our talent team delivers data, analytics, and advice to business leaders so they can make better workforce decisions and align their business and people strategies. We support clients across the full employee lifecycle, including talent assessment and selection, compensation benchmarking, total rewards strategy optimization, Corporate Governance, ESG consulting, and strategic employee communications.\nWealth Solutions \nincludes retirement consulting, pension administration, and investments consulting. Retirement consulting provides clients strategic design advice, actuarial services, risk management solutions including pension risk transfer, and integrated pension administration. We also help organizations manage their balance sheet volatility. Our investments advisory team provides corporations, public pensions, endowments and foundations with advice on developing and maintaining investment programs across a broad range of plan types, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and Master Trusts. Our delegated investment solutions provide ongoing management of investment programs in both partial or full discretionary models. We partner with clients leveraging our expertise and scale to help them effectively manage their investment portfolio.\nRevenue and Compensation\nOur business generates revenues primarily through commissions, compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies for services we provide to them, and fees from customers. Commissions and fees for brokerage services vary depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular services provided to a client, insurer, or reinsurer, and the capacity in which we act. Compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies includes: (1) fees for consulting and analytics services, and (2) fees and commissions for administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers and reinsurers. Fees from clients for advice and consulting services are dependent on the extent and value of the services we provide. Payment terms are consistent with current industry practices.\nFunds Held on Behalf of Clients\nWe typically hold funds on behalf of clients, including premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit to and from insurers. Certain funds held on behalf of clients are invested in interest-bearing premium trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect and remit cash. The principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes, although we may earn interest on these accounts.\nCompetition\nOur business operates in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. We compete with numerous other global insurance brokers and consulting companies, including, among others, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J Gallagher & Company, and Lockton Companies, Inc., as well as numerous other global, regional, and local firms in almost every area of our business. We also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that directly market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents. Additionally, we compete with other businesses that do not fall into the categories above, including large financial institutions and independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, human resources, and financial services firms.\n6\nSeasonality\nDue to buying patterns and delivery of certain products and services in the markets we serve, revenues recognized tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.\nLicensing and Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate, including U.S. federal and state laws. See the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRegulatory authorities in the U.S. and most other countries in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individuals, entities, and related service providers to obtain a license from a government agency, including (but not limited to) licenses to operate as insurance producers, brokers, agents, consultants, reinsurance brokers, or managing general agents. \nCertain jurisdictions issue licenses only to resident entities or individuals. In such jurisdictions, if the Company has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction. Such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process. \nOur subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business. These laws and regulations are enforced by the FCA in the U.K., by federal and state agencies in the U.S., and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business, the licensing of agents, the monitoring of trade practices, policy form approval, limits on commission rates, and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements.\nInsurance authorities in the U.K., U.S., and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.\nInvestment, securities, and futures licensing authorities also govern certain business activities. For example, in the U.S., we use Aon Securities LLC, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Aon, and a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member of FINRA and Securities Investor Protection Corporation, for investment banking, capital advisory services and other broker-dealer activities. Similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S.\nFurther, pension and financial laws and regulations, including oversight and supervision by the FCA in the U.K., the SEC and the DOL in the U.S., and regulators in other countries govern certain of the retirement-related consulting services provided by Aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes Aon subsidiaries that provide investment advisory services regulated by various U.S. federal authorities including the SEC, DOL, and FINRA, as well as authorities on the state level. In addition, other services provided by Aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates, such as trustee services and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services, are subject in various jurisdictions to pension, investment, securities, and insurance laws and regulations, and supervision.\nClientele\nOur clients operate in many businesses and industries throughout the \nworld. Our single largest client by revenue accounted for approximately \n1% of \nour Total revenue in 2024. Additionally, we place insurance with many insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of the tot\nal premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2024.\nAon United, Our Culture, and Human Capital Management Strategy\nOur Culture\nOur culture is driven by our values – committed as one firm to our purpose, united through trust and integrity as one inclusive team, and passionate about making our colleagues and clients successful. Our colleagues are the cornerstone of our success. Collaboration and innovation drive our culture, bringing the best of Aon to clients in a holistic and seamless manner. Our Aon United strategy defines how our colleagues work together to deliver value to clients, setting a new standard for client leadership. Aon United is brought to life through our common client value creation model which scales strategies from across the firm, through our Risk Capital and Human Capital solutions, to bring the best of Aon to clients. Each year, Aon makes significant philanthropic contributions to various organizations, supports numerous colleague volunteer opportunities, and \n7\noffers paid time off to volunteer. In 2023, we announced our 3x3 Plan to accelerate Aon United by delivering industry defining client content, unmatched capabilities, and exceptional service over three years. \nColleagues\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 60,000 employees and conducted our operations in more than 120 countries. Our colleagues’ diverse talents, expertise, and insights contribute to the success of both our firm and our clients, and we seek to attract, grow, and retain the best talent in the industry. Our Inclusive People Leadership strategy is a central part of our Aon United strategy and is a key enabler to realizing our aspirations and purpose as a firm. All our colleagues are called upon to be leaders in embracing and modeling our Aon United values and behaviors. Inclusive People Leadership at Aon is designed to ensure that all colleagues – at every stage of their career journey – are equipped and motivated to deliver on our purpose and able to achieve their full potential. Our colleague experience ensures that colleagues feel more relevant, connected and valued which creates a greater sense of belonging. \nTraining and Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and remain an attractive employer. Colleagues are invited to complete a broad spectrum of curricula to meet their career stage goals and developmental needs. We provide our colleagues what they need to learn and grow to be best-in-class client leaders. From self-guided learning courses to advanced leadership programs, the curriculum is aligned to the Aon United strategy. Our investment in technology and use of virtual and in-person based learning and development programs allows us to deliver targeted offerings designed to advance all colleagues’ development. \nColleague Engagement and Retention\nProviding an engaging and rewarding colleague experience is a top priority for us and understanding colleagues’ feedback helps us to reach that goal. We use a variety of channels to facilitate open, on-going, and direct communication with colleagues. These channels include open forums and town halls with executives, colleague surveys, and engagement through our Business Resource Groups. Business Resource Groups are our independent and voluntary networks that provide input, take action, and help identify opportunities for our firm to further commitments to inclusion, wellbeing, and belonging. \nOur engagement survey process consists of frequent pulse surveys, as well as our annual all colleague support survey which enables us to understand how colleagues are engaging with their teams, the firm, and clients. This outreach effort allows us to gather insights more rapidly, take timely action to address feedback, and deliver on the needs of colleagues in real time – ensuring colleagues feel more connected, more valued and m\nore relevant. The pulse surveys for 2024 were focused on topics such as manager and leadership support, delivering on our Aon Story, colleague wellbeing, inclusion, talent acquisition and performance and rewards. Feedback from our workforce provide\ns management with a better understanding of evolving colleague viewpoints, and ensures we are taking appropriate steps to drive colleague engagement and retention. For discussion of the risks related to the attraction and retention of senior management and other professional personnel, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report. \nRewards\nIn addition to an inspired purpose and culture, we are proud to offer our colleagues a total rewards program that combines competitive pay, incentive opportunities, and benefits. Our compensation programs including salary, recognition, cash, and equity incentives are connected to our formal performance management and career development approach. These programs serve to reward colleagues for their Aon United impact both in what they accomplish for clients, colleagues, and shareholders, how they achieve those results and how they deliver on our values. We maintain a global commitment to colleague wellbeing and play a key role in supporting colleagues across the physical, emotional, financial, and social spectrum. Our comprehensive benefit programs are competitive for the markets in which we operate and aligned with our values and culture. \nOur compensation philosophy aligns with our Aon United strategy and delivering long-term shareholder value creation. Our executive incentives are based on driving results, delivery of strategic initiatives, and leadership. Twenty percent of executive discretionary incentive compensation is based on quantifiable performance against strategic people priorities, including talent retention, engagement, wellbeing and inclusion.\nInclusion\nWe believe that inclusive teams produce better insight, better solutions and, ultimately, the best outcomes for clients and our long-term success. \n8\nWe are focused on being a firm that is representative of the communities in which we operate. We aim to achieve this by aligning inclusion actions to the following pillars: recruitment, education, promotion, and representation. We strongly believe that only when colleagues can be their authentic selves will they reach their full potential.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) oversees Aon’s ERM program and allocates certain oversight responsibilities to its committees and any sub-committees, as appropriate. Our commitment to inclusion starts from the top with our the Board, including its Inclusion & Wellbeing Sub-Committee. Our Global Inclusive Leadership Council is sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Our colleague-led Business Resource Groups also support execution and provide additional opportunities for colleagues to enhance our inclusive environment.\nAs of December 31, 2024,\n our global workforce wa\ns 54% women and 46% men,\n and the Aon Executive Committee, which leads the firm was \n53% women and 47% men. A\nt the manager level, \n28% of senior leaders and 44% of managers with one or more direct report were women. \nNew colleague hires for the year \nwere 53% women and 47% men. Our\n U.S. workforce w\nas 25% racially or ethnically \ndiverse, calculated as a percentage of colleagues that have voluntarily disclosed their race or ethnicity to Aon. At the manager level, 12% of U.S. senior leaders and 18% of U.S. managers with one or more direct report were racially or ethnically diverse. New colleague hires for the year in the U.S. were 30% racially or ethnically diverse.\nApprenticeship Program\nApprenticeship programs help build a talent pipeline of highly skilled professionals while providing apprentices with advanced education and work experience. By removing some of the traditional barriers to entry-level employment, as a firm we can contribute to local workforce development and cultivate talent while improving retention rates in these entry-level roles. As a founding member of ten apprentice networks within the U.S., we partner with companies and organizations to assist them in building their own programs through sharing best practices and learnings. Across these networks, we ha\nve 249 organizations committed as\n of December 31, 2024.\nOur two-year Apprenticeship Program, which was implemented in the UK and U.S. in 2012 and 2017, respectively, serves as an alternate route into a permanent role that normally requires a specific degree or professional experience. We provide motivated, high-potential individuals with the required training (on the job and in the classroom), professional skills development, mentorship, and experiential learning to bridge the gap\n. 802 Aon \napprentices have been hired since the inception of the program across the U.S. and U.K. Both programs are certified apprenticeship programs, by the Department of Labor in the U.S. and the Department of Education in the U.K. \nWebsite Access to Reports and Other Information\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through our website (https://www.aon.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

  "item7": "Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nAon plc is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of Risk Capital and Human Capital solutions. Through our experience, global reach, and comprehensive analytics, we help clients meet rapidly changing, increasingly complex, and interconnected challenges related to risk and people. We are committed to accelerating innovation to address unmet and evolving client needs so that our clients are better informed, better advised, and able to make better decisions to protect and grow their business. Management remains focused on strengthening Aon and uniting the firm with a portfolio of Risk Capital and Human Capital capabilities enabled by data and analytics and a united operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.\nFinancial Results\nThe following is a summary of our 2024 financial results:\n•\nRevenue increased $2.3 billion\n, or \n17%\n, to \n$15.7 billion\n, reflectin\ng acquired revenues from NFP and 6% organic revenue growth, driven by net new business and ongoing strong retention. Risk Capital revenue increased $1.0 billion, or 10%, to $10.5 billion and Human Capital revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 35%\n, to \n$5.2 billion\n in \n2024\n compared to \n2023\n.\n•\nOperating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 24%, to $11.9 billion in \n2024\n due primarily to the inclusion of NFP’s operating expenses, an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, Accelerating Aon United restructuring charges, and transaction and integration costs, partially offset by $110 million of restructuring savings. Risk Capital operating expenses increased \n$647 million\n, or 10%, to $7.2 billion\n and Human Capital operating expenses\n increased $1.3 billion, or 47%, to $4.1 billion in 2024 compared to 2023.\n•\nOperating margin decreased to 24.4% in 2024 from 28.3% in 2023, driven primarily by the addition of NFP and an increase in operating expenses as previously described, partially offset by organic revenue growth of \n6% and $110 million of net restructuring savings\n. \nRisk Capital operating margin increased to 31.3% in 2024 from 30.9% in 2023 and Human Capital operating margin decreased to 21.9% in 2024 from 28.4% in 2023.\n•\nDue to the factors set forth above, Net income was $2.7 billion in 2024, an increase of $92 million, or 4%, from 2023.\n•\nDiluted earnings per share was $12.49 per share in 2024 compared to $12.51 per share in the prior year period.\n•\nCash flows provided by operating activities was $3.0 billion in 2024, a decrease of $400 million, or 12%, from $3.4 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher cash taxes, payments related to restructuring, legal settlement expenses, and transaction and integration costs, partially offset by strong adjusted operating income growth and working capital improvements. \nWe focus on four key metrics, that are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2024:\n•\nOrganic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 6% in 2024, compared to 7% organic growth in the prior year period, driven by net new business and ongoing strong retention.\n•\nAdjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 31.5% in 2024, compared to 31.6% in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects the addition of NFP and increased expenses, partially offset by 6% organic revenue growth and $110 million of net restructuring savings. Risk Capital adju\nsted operating margin \nincreased\n to \n34.6%\n in 2024 from \n34.2%\n in 2023 and Human Capital adjusted operating margin \ndecreased to 29.5% in \n2024 from \n29.9% in \n2023. \n•\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $15.60 per share in 2024, an increase of $1.46 per share, or 10%, from $14.14 per share in 2023. \n31\n•\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $2.8 billion in 2024, a decrease of $366 million, or 11%, from $3.2 billion in 2023, reflecting a decrease in Cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $34 million decrease in capital expenditures.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE\nFor many companies, the management of ESG risks and opportunities has become increasingly important, and ESG-related challenges, such as extreme weather events, supply chain disruptions, cyber events, regulatory changes, ongoing public health impacts, and the increased focus on workforce resilience in various work environments, continue to create volatility and uncertainty for our clients. At Aon, helping clients manage risk - including ESG risk - is at the core of what we do. We offer a wide range of risk assessment, consulting, and advisory solutions, many of which are significant parts of our core business offerings, designed to address and manage ESG issues for clients, and to enable our clients to create more sustainable value. We see significant opportunity in enhancing our impact and delivering innovative client solutions on ESG matters.\nACQUISITION OF NFP\nOn April 25, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of NFP, a leading middle-market provider of property and casualty brokerage, benefits consulting, wealth management, and retirement plan consulting, with more than 7,700 colleagues. The Company acquired NFP Intermediate Holdings A Corp in a cash-and-stock merger for an aggregate U.S. GAAP preliminary purchase price totaling $9.1 billion, including approximately $3.2 billion to settle NFP indebtedness and cash consideration to the selling shareholders, and approximately 19 million class A ordinary shares with a fair value of approximately $5.9 billion, based on the Company’s closing stock price on April 25, 2024. In addition, the company had other adjustments of $3.9 billion for cash and certain assumed liabilities.\n32\nREVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nSummary of Results\nOur consolidated results are as follows (in millions):\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenue\n \n \n \nTotal revenue\n$\n15,698 \n$\n13,376 \n$\n12,479 \nExpenses\n \n \n \nCompensation and benefits\n8,283 \n6,902 \n6,477 \nInformation technology\n539 \n534 \n509 \nPremises\n325 \n294 \n289 \nDepreciation of fixed assets\n183 \n167 \n151 \nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\n503 \n89 \n113 \nOther general expense\n1,641 \n1,470 \n1,271 \nAccelerating Aon United Program expenses\n389 \n135 \n— \nTotal operating expenses\n11,863 \n9,591 \n8,810 \nOperating income\n3,835 \n3,785 \n3,669 \nInterest income\n67 \n31 \n18 \nInterest expense\n(788)\n(484)\n(406)\nOther income (expense)\n348 \n(163)\n(125)\nIncome before income taxes\n3,462 \n3,169 \n3,156 \nIncome tax expense\n742 \n541 \n510 \nNet income\n2,720 \n2,628 \n2,646 \nLess: Net income attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\n66 \n64 \n57 \nNet income attributable to Aon shareholders\n$\n2,654 \n$\n2,564 \n$\n2,589 \nDiluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders\n$\n12.49 \n$\n12.51 \n$\n12.14 \nWeighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted\n212.5 \n205.0 \n213.2 \nOur segment results are as follows (in millions):\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nRisk Capital\nHuman Capital\nCorporate/Eliminations \n(1)\nTotal Consolidated\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nRevenue\nTotal revenue\n$\n10,517 \n$\n9,524 \n$\n5,209 \n$\n3,864 \n$\n(28)\n$\n(12)\n$\n15,698 \n$\n13,376 \nExpenses\nCompensation and benefits\n5,417 \n4,800 \n2,739 \n2,003 \n127 \n99 \n8,283 \n6,902 \nInformation technology\n368 \n385 \n168 \n148 \n3 \n1 \n539 \n534 \nPremises\n215 \n204 \n110 \n88 \n— \n2 \n325 \n294 \nOther expenses \n(2) \n1,225 \n1,189 \n1,049 \n528 \n442 \n144 \n2,716 \n1,861 \nTotal operating expenses\n7,225 \n6,578 \n4,066 \n2,767 \n572 \n246 \n11,863 \n9,591 \nOperating income\n$\n3,292 \n$\n2,946 \n$\n1,143 \n$\n1,097 \n$\n(600)\n$\n(258)\n$\n3,835 \n$\n3,785 \nOperating margin\n31.3 \n%\n30.9 \n%\n21.9 \n%\n28.4 \n%\n24.4 \n%\n28.3 \n%\n(1)\nSegment expenses exclude governance costs, post-retirement benefits, and other costs that are not directly attributable to a specific segment.\n(2)\nIncludes expenses related to Depreciation of fixed assets, Amortization and impairment of intangible assets, Accelerating Aon United Program expenses, and Other general expenses. \n33\nRefer to “Non-GAAP Metrics” below for a reconciliation of segment operating margin to segment adjusted operating margin.\nConsolidated and Segment Results for 2024 Compared to 2023\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased $2.3 billion, or 17%, to $15.7 billion in 2024, compared to $13.4 billion in 2023, reflecting acquired revenues from NFP and 6% organic revenue growth.

Organic revenue growth was 7% in 2024 reflecting strong growth in treaty, driven by net new business and strong retention, as well as strength in facultative placements. In addition, market impact was modestly positive on results in the year. \nHuman Capital\nHealth Solutions \nrevenue increased $902 million, or 37%, to $3.3 billion in 2024, compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. Organic revenue growth was 6% in 2024, reflecting strong growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage, driven by net new business and ongoing strong retention.\nWealth Solutions \nrevenue increased $443 million, or 31%, to $1.9 billion in 2024, compared to $1.4 billion in 2023. Organic revenue growth was 7% in 2024 reflecting growth in Retirement, driven by advisory demand and project-related work related to pension de-risking and ongoing impact of regulatory changes. Growth in Investments was highlighted by strong revenue growth within NFP, driven by net asset inflows and market performance.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits increased $1.4 billion, or 20%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of operating expenses from NFP and an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, partially offset by savings from Accelerating Aon United restructuring actions.\nInformation Technology\nInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, increased $5 million, or 1%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of ongoing operating expenses from NFP, partially offset by efficiencies from our Aon Business Services operating platform and savings from Accelerating Aon United restructuring actions.\nPremises\nPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, increased $31 million, or 11%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to the inclusion of operating expenses from NFP, partially offset by savings from Accelerating Aon United restructuring actions.\nDepreciation of Fixed Assets\nDepreciation of fixed assets primarily relates to software, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer equipment, buildings, and vehicles. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $16 million, or 10%, in 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to the inclusion of operating expenses from NFP, partially offset by savings from Accelerating Aon United restructuring actions.\nAmortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets \nAmortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived customer-related and contract-based, technology, and tradename assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles increased $414 million, or 465%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in intangible assets related to the NFP Transaction.\n34\nOther General Expense\nOther general expenses increased $171 million, or 12%,\n in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was due primarily to the inclusion of ongoing operating expenses from NFP, as well as NFP related transaction and integration costs, partially offset by\n \na non-recurring charge in connection with certain settlement expenses in the prior year period.\nAccelerating Aon United Program Expenses\nAccelerating Aon United Program expenses were $389 million in 2024 compared to $135 million in 2023, reflecting restructuring charges associated with the AAU Program announced in the third quarter of 2023, relating to workforce optimization, technology and other costs, and asset impairments. \nTotal Operating Expenses and Operating Income \nTotal operating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 24%, to $11.9 billion in \n2024\n due primarily to the inclusion of NFP’s operating expenses, an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, Accelerating Aon United restructuring charges, and transaction and integration costs, partially offset by $110 million of restructuring savings. \nDue to the factors set forth above, Total operating income increased \n$50 million\n, or 1%, to \n$3.8 billion\n in 2024.\nRisk Capital Total operating expenses increased $647 million, or 10% to $7.2 billion in 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Compensation and benefits and an increase in Other expenses. The increase in Compensation and benefits is due to the inclusion of operating expenses from NFP and an increase in expense associated with 5% and 7% organic revenue growth in Commercial Risk Solutions and Reinsurance Solutions, respectively, partially offset by restructuring savings. The increase in Other expenses is primarily due to increased Amortization and impairment from the NFP Transaction and Accelerating Aon United restructuring charges. Due to the factors set forth above, Risk Capital operating income increased $346 million, or 12%, to $3.3 billion in 2024.\nHuman Capital Total operating expenses increased $1.3 billion, or 47% to $4.1 billion in 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Compensation and benefits and an increase in Other expenses. The increase in Compensation and benefits is due to the inclusion of operating expenses from NFP and an increase in expense associated with 6% and 7% organic revenue growth in Health Solutions and Wealth Solutions, respectively. The increase in Other expenses is primarily due to increased Amortization and impairment of intangible assets acquired from the NFP Transaction. Due to the factors set forth above, Human Capital operating income increased $46 million, or 4%, to $1.1 billion in 2024.\nInterest Income\nInterest income represents income earned, net of expense, on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $67 million in 2024, an increase of $36 million, or 116%, from 2023, primarily reflecting interest earned on the investment of $5 billion of term debt proceeds, which were ultimately used to fund the acquisition of NFP.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $788 million in 2024, an increase of $304 million, or 63%, from 2023. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in total debt outstanding, primarily to fund the acquisition of NFP.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income was $348 million in 2024, compared to Other expense of $163 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to gain on the sale of businesses.\nIncome before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes increased $293 million, or 9% to $3.5 billion in 2024, compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate on Net income was 21.4% in 2024 and 17.1% in 2023. \nThe 2024 tax rate was primarily driven by \nthe geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, including the favorable impacts of share-based payments and the unfavorable impact of other discrete items.\n35\nThe 2023 tax rate was primarily driven by \nthe geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, including the tax benefits associated with the release of a valuation allowance, and share-based payments.\nIreland, the U.K., Singapore, and many E.U. member states, among others, have enacted legislation to implement the global minimum tax that is generally consistent with the OECD’s proposed Pillar Two tax regime. There remains significant uncertainty, however, as to how Pillar Two will ultimately apply to the Company. The OECD has issued numerous guidance documents attempting to change how Pillar Tax operates, subject to enactment by each implementing country, and the OECD may issue additional guidance in the future. The Company is actively monitoring developments in this area and continues to evaluate the guidance and the potential impacts this may have on its global effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in 2025 and future periods.\nNet Income Attributable to Aon Shareholders\nNet income attributable to Aon shareholders increased $90 million to $2.7 billion, or $12.49 per diluted share, in 2024, compared to $2.6 billion, or $12.51 per diluted share, in 2023.\nConsolidated and Segment Results for 2023 Compared to 2022\nDue to our change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, a discussion of our segment results for 2023 compared to 2022 is included below. Otherwise, we have elected not to include a discussion of our consolidated results for 2023 compared to 2022 in this report in reliance upon Instruction 1 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K. This discussion can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024.  Our segment results are as follows (in millions):\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nRisk Capital\nHuman Capital\nCorporate/Eliminations \n(1)\nTotal Consolidated\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenue\nTotal revenue\n$\n9,524 \n$\n8,905 \n$\n3,864 \n$\n3,591 \n$\n(12)\n$\n(17)\n$\n13,376 \n$\n12,479 \nExpenses\nCompensation and benefits\n4,800 \n4,532 \n2,003 \n1,856 \n99 \n89 \n6,902 \n6,477 \nInformation technology\n385 \n361 \n148 \n146 \n1 \n2 \n534 \n509 \nPremises\n204 \n195 \n88 \n88 \n2 \n6 \n294 \n289 \nOther expenses \n(2) \n1,189 \n922 \n528 \n540 \n144 \n73 \n1,861 \n1,535 \nTotal operating expenses\n6,578 \n6,010 \n2,767 \n2,630 \n246 \n170 \n9,591 \n8,810 \nOperating income\n$\n2,946 \n$\n2,895 \n$\n1,097 \n$\n961 \n$\n(258)\n$\n(187)\n$\n3,785 \n$\n3,669 \nOperating margin\n30.9 \n%\n32.5 \n%\n28.4 \n%\n26.8 \n%\n28.3 \n%\n29.4 \n%\n(1)\nSegment expenses exclude governance costs, post-retirement benefits, and other costs that are not directly attributable to a specific segment.\n(2)\nIncludes expenses related to Depreciation of fixed assets, Amortization and impairment of intangible assets, Accelerating Aon United Program expenses, and Other general expenses. \nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased $897 million, or 7%, to $13.4 billion in 2023, compared to $12.5 billion in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by 7% organic revenue growth and a 2% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures, and other. Risk Capital revenue increased $619 million, or 7%, to $9.5 billion and Human Capital revenue increased $273 million, or 8%, to $3.9 billion.\n36\nRisk Capital\nCommercial Risk Solutions \nrevenue increased $328 million, or 5%, to $7.0 billion in 2023, compared to $6.7 billion in 2022. Organic revenue growth was 5% in 2023, reflecting growth across all major geographies, driven by strong retention, management of the renewal book, and net new business generation. Growth in retail brokerage was highlighted by double-digit growth in Asia and the Pacific, driven by continued strength in core P&C. The U.S. grew modestly driven by strength in core areas of property, casualty, and construction, partially offset by the impact of external M&A and IPO activity. On average globally, exposures and pricing were positive, resulting in modestly positive market impact.\nReinsurance Solutions\n revenue increased $291 million, or 13%, to $2.5 billion in 2023, compared to $2.2 billion in 2022. Organic revenue growth was 10% in 2023 driven by strong retention and net new business generation, as well as strong growth in core Reinsurance. In addition, market impact was modestly positive overall.\nHuman Capital\nHealth Solutions\n revenue increased $209 million, or 9%, to $2.4 billion in 2023, compared to $2.2 billion in 2022. Organic revenue growth was 10% in 2023, reflecting strong growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage, driven by net new business generation and management of the renewal book. Strength in health and benefits included growth in advisory work related to wellbeing and resilience. Results also reflect double-digit growth in consumer benefits and strong growth in talent advisory services.\nWealth Solutions\n revenue increased $64 million, or 5%, to $1.4 billion in 2023, compared to $1.4 billion in 2022. Organic revenue growth was 4% in 2023 reflecting growth in Retirement, driven by advisory demand and project-related work related to pension de-risking and ongoing impact of regulatory changes. In Investments, a decrease in AUM-based delegated investment management revenue due to debt and equity market movements was partially offset by higher advisory demand and project- related work.\nTotal Operating Expenses and Operating Income \nTotal operating expenses \nincreased\n \n$781 million\n, or \n9%\n, to \n$9.6 billion\n in \n2023 primarily due to an increase in expense associated with 7% \norganic revenue growth, investments in long-term growth, a $197 million charge in connection with certain accrued actual or anticipated legal settlement expenses, and \n$135 million\n of expenses related to the Accelerating Aon United Restructuring Program. \nDue to the factors set forth above, Total operating income increased $116 million, or 3%, to $3.8 billion in 2023.\nRisk Capital operating expenses increased $568 million, or 9%, to $6.6 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Compensation and benefits as a result of additional expense associated with 5% and 10% organic revenue growth in Commercial Risk Solutions and Reinsurance Solutions, respectively. Due to the factors set forth above, Risk Capital operating income increased $51 million, or 2%, to $2.9 billion in 2023.\nHuman Capital operating expenses increased $137 million, or 5%, to $2.8 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Compensation and benefits as a result of additional expense associated with 10% and 4% organic revenue growth in Health Solutions and Wealth Solutions, respectively. Due to the factors set forth above, Human Capital operating income increased $136 million, or 14%, to $1.1 billion in 2023.\nAdditionally, due to our change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, a discussion of our non-GAAP segment results for 2023 compared to 2022 is included in the Non-GAAP Metrics section below. \nNon-GAAP Metrics\nIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted net income per share, adjusted other income (expense), adjusted effective tax rate, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n37\nOrganic Revenue Growth\nWe use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from ongoing operations. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of certain intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions (provided that organic revenue growth includes organic growth of an acquired business as calculated assuming that the acquired business was part of the combined company for the same proportion of the relevant prior year period), divestitures (including held for sale disposal groups, if any), transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages): \n \nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n(millions)\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nLess: Currency Impact\n (1)\nLess: Fiduciary Investment Income\n (2)\nLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other\nOrganic Revenue Growth \n(3)\nRisk Capital Revenue:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommercial Risk Solutions\n$\n7,861 \n$\n7,043 \n12%\n—%\n—%\n7%\n5%\nReinsurance Solutions\n2,656 \n2,481 \n7\n—\n1\n(1)\n7\nHuman Capital Revenue:\nHealth Solutions\n3,335 \n2,433 \n37\n—\n—\n31\n6\nWealth Solutions\n1,874 \n1,431 \n31\n1\n—\n23\n7\nEliminations\n(28)\n(12)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal revenue\n$\n15,698 \n$\n13,376 \n17%\n—%\n—%\n11%\n6%\n \nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n(millions)\n2023\n2022\n% Change\nLess: Currency Impact\n (1)\nLess: Fiduciary Investment Income\n (2)\nLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other\nOrganic Revenue Growth \n(3)\nRisk Capital Revenue:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommercial Risk Solutions\n$\n7,043 \n$\n6,715 \n5%\n—%\n2%\n(2)%\n5%\nReinsurance Solutions\n2,481 \n2,190 \n13\n(1)\n4\n—\n10\nHuman Capital Revenue:\nHealth Solutions\n2,433 \n2,224 \n9\n—\n—\n(1)\n10\nWealth Solutions\n1,431 \n1,367 \n5\n—\n—\n1\n4\nEliminations\n(12)\n(17)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal revenue\n$\n13,376 \n$\n12,479 \n7%\n—%\n2%\n(2)%\n7%\n(1)\nCurrency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates.\n(2)\nFiduciary investment income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n \nwas $315 million, $274 million, and $76 million, respectively.\n(3)\nOrganic revenue growth includes the impact of certain intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions (provided that Organic revenue growth includes Organic growth of an acquired business as calculated assuming that the acquired business was part of the combined company for the same proportion of the relevant prior year period), divestitures (including held for sale disposal groups, if any), transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges.\n38\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nWe use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses are the best indicators of our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported operating margin is as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nRisk Capital\nHuman Capital\nCorporate/Eliminations \n(1)\nTotal Consolidated\n(millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nRevenue\n$\n10,517 \n$\n9,524 \n$\n5,209 \n$\n3,864 \n$\n(28)\n$\n(12)\n$\n15,698 \n$\n13,376 \nOperating income\n$\n3,292 \n$\n2,946 \n$\n1,143 \n$\n1,097 \n$\n(600)\n$\n(258)\n$\n3,835 \n$\n3,785 \nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\n211 \n53 \n292 \n36 \n— \n— \n503 \n89 \nChange in the fair value of contingent consideration\n6 \n— \n21 \n— \n— \n— \n27 \n— \nAccelerating Aon United Program expenses \n(2)\n114 \n57 \n27 \n23 \n248 \n55 \n389 \n135 \nLegal settlements \n(3)\n— \n197 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n197 \nTransaction and integration costs\n (4)\n12 \n— \n53 \n— \n120 \n17 \n185 \n17 \nAdjusted operating income\n$\n3,635 \n$\n3,253 \n$\n1,536 \n$\n1,156 \n$\n(232)\n$\n(186)\n$\n4,939 \n$\n4,223 \nOperating margin\n31.3 \n%\n30.9 \n%\n21.9 \n%\n28.4 \n%\n24.4 \n%\n28.3 \n%\nAdjusted operating margin\n34.6 \n%\n34.2 \n%\n29.5 \n%\n29.9 \n%\n31.5 \n%\n31.6 \n%\n(1)\nSegment expenses exclude governance costs, post-retirement benefits, and other costs that are not directly attributable to a specific segment.\n(2)\nTotal charges are expected to include technology-related costs to facilitate streamlining and simplifying operations, headcount reduction costs, and costs associated with asset impairments, including real estate consolidation costs.\n(3)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Aon recognized actual or anticipated legal settlement expenses in connection with transactions for which capital was arranged by a third party, Vesttoo Ltd., primarily in the form of letters of credit from third party banks that are alleged to have been fraudulent. Certain actual or anticipated legal settlement expenses totaling $197 million have been recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 within the Risk Capital segment, where certain potentially meaningful amounts may be recoverable in future periods.\n(4)\nOn April 25, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of NFP. As part of the acquisition, Aon incurred $191 million transaction and integration costs in 2024. Transaction costs include advisory, legal, accounting, regulatory, and other professional or consulting fees required to complete the acquisition. $96 million in transaction costs were recognized in 2024. In 2024, $90 million of transaction costs were recognized in Total operating expenses and $6 million were recognized in Other income (expense) related to the extinguishment of acquired NFP debt. The NFP Transaction will also result in certain non-recurring integration costs associated with colleague severance, retention bonus awards, termination of redundant third-party agreements, costs associated with legal entity rationalization, and professional or consulting fees related to alignment of management processes and controls, as well as costs associated with the assessment of NFP information technology environment and security protocols. Aon incurred $95 million of integration costs in 2024.\nRisk Capital adjusted operating income increased $382 million, or 12%, to $3.6 billion in 2024. The increase was primarily due to the impact of NFP and organic revenue growth of 5% in Commercial Risk Solutions and 7% in Reinsurance Solutions, partially offset by increased expenses, including the inclusion of ongoing operating expenses from NFP. Human Capital adjusted operating income increased $380 million, or 33%, to $1.5 billion in 2024. The increase was primarily due to the impact of NFP and organic revenue growth of 6% in Health Solutions and 7% in Wealth Solutions, partially offset by increased expenses, including the inclusion of ongoing operating expenses from NFP.\n39\nA reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported operating margin is as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nRisk Capital\nHuman Capital\nCorporate/Eliminations \n(1)\nTotal Consolidated\n(millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenue\n$\n9,524 \n$\n8,905 \n$\n3,864 \n$\n3,591 \n$\n(12)\n$\n(17)\n$\n13,376 \n$\n12,479 \nOperating income\n$\n2,946 \n$\n2,895 \n$\n1,097 \n$\n961 \n$\n(258)\n$\n(187)\n$\n3,785 \n$\n3,669 \nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\n53 \n62 \n36 \n51 \n— \n— \n89 \n113 \nAccelerating Aon United Program expenses \n(2)\n57 \n— \n23 \n— \n55 \n— \n135 \n— \nLegal settlements \n(3)\n197 \n21 \n— \n37 \n— \n— \n197 \n58 \nTransaction and integration costs\n (4)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n17 \n— \n17 \n— \nAdjusted operating income\n$\n3,253 \n$\n2,978 \n$\n1,156 \n$\n1,049 \n$\n(186)\n$\n(187)\n$\n4,223 \n$\n3,840 \nOperating margin\n30.9 \n%\n32.5 \n%\n28.4 \n%\n26.8 \n%\n28.3 \n%\n29.4 \n%\nAdjusted operating margin\n34.2 \n%\n33.4 \n%\n29.9 \n%\n29.2 \n%\n31.6 \n%\n30.8 \n%\n(1)\nSegment expenses exclude governance costs, post-retirement benefits, and other costs that are not directly attributable to a specific segment.\n(2)\nTotal charges are expected to include technology-related costs to facilitate streamlining and simplifying operations, headcount reduction costs, and costs associated with asset impairments, including real estate consolidation costs.\n(3)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Aon recognized actual or anticipated legal settlement expenses in connection with transactions for which capital was arranged by a third party, Vesttoo Ltd., primarily in the form of letters of credit from third party banks that are alleged to have been fraudulent. Certain actual or anticipated legal settlement expenses totaling $197 million have been recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 within the Risk Capital segment, where certain potentially meaningful amounts may be recoverable in future periods. Additionally, a $58 million charge was recognized in the second quarter of 2022 with certain other legal settlements reached in matters unrelated to Vesttoo.  \n(4)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Aon entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NFP. As part of the definitive agreement, certain transaction costs were incurred including advisory, legal, accounting, and other professional or consulting fees required to complete the acquisition.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\nWe use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses are the best indicators of our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n40\nA reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share data and percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nU.S. GAAP\nAdjustments\nNon-GAAP Adjusted\nOperating income\n$\n3,835 \n$\n1,104 \n$\n4,939 \nInterest income\n67 \n— \n67 \nInterest expense\n(788)\n— \n(788)\nOther income (expense) \n(1)(2)(3)\n348 \n(335)\n13 \nIncome before income taxes \n3,462 \n769 \n4,231 \nIncome tax expense \n(4)\n742 \n107 \n849 \nNet income\n2,720 \n662 \n3,382 \nLess: Net income attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\n66 \n— \n66 \nNet income attributable to Aon shareholders\n$\n2,654 \n$\n662 \n$\n3,316 \nDiluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders\n$\n12.49 \n$\n3.11 \n$\n15.60 \nWeighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted\n212.5 \n— \n212.5 \nEffective tax rates \n(4)\n21.4 \n%\n20.1 \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nU.S. GAAP\nAdjustments\nNon-GAAP Adjusted\nOperating income \n$\n3,785 \n$\n438 \n$\n4,223 \nInterest income\n31 \n— \n31 \nInterest expense\n(484)\n— \n(484)\nOther income (expense)\n (5)\n(163)\n27 \n(136)\nIncome before income taxes \n3,169 \n465 \n3,634 \nIncome tax expense \n(4)\n541 \n130 \n671 \nNet income\n2,628 \n335 \n2,963 \nLess: Net income attributable to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests\n64 \n— \n64 \nNet income attributable to Aon shareholders\n$\n2,564 \n$\n335 \n$\n2,899 \nDiluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders\n$\n12.51 \n$\n1.63 \n$\n14.14 \nWeighted average ordinary shares outstanding — diluted\n205.0 \n— \n205.0 \nEffective tax rates\n (4)\n17.1 \n%\n18.5 \n%\n(1)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, $84 million\n in gains were recognized related to deferred consideration from the affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. and the other designated purchasers related to a divestiture completed in a prior year period.\n(2)\nAdjusted other income (expense) excluded gains from dispositions of $257 million related to the sale of a business in 2024.\n(3)\nAdjusted other income (expense) excluded $6 million of debt extinguishment charges related to the repayment of NFP debt, which is considered a transaction related cost incurred in the second quarter of 2024.\n(4)\nAdjusted items are generally taxed at the estimated annual effective tax rate, except for the applicable tax impact associated with certain pension and legal settlements, Accelerating Aon United Program expenses, deferred consideration from a prior year sale of business, certain gains from dispositions, certain transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of NFP, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, which are adjusted at the related jurisdictional rate. The tax adjustment also excludes interest accruals for income tax reserves related to the termination fee payment made in connection with the Company’s terminated proposed combination with Willis Towers Watson. \n(5)\nTo further its pension de-risking strategy, the Company settled certain pension obligations in the Netherlands through the purchase of annuities, where certain pension assets were liquidated to purchase the annuities. A non-cash settlement charge of $27 million was recognized in the second quarter of 2023, which is excluded from adjusted other income (expense). \n41\nFree Cash Flow\nWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes the supplemental information related to free cash flow is helpful to investors when evaluating our operating performance and liquidity results. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Cash provided by operating activities is as follows (in millions):\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,035 \n$\n3,435 \nCapital expenditures\n(218)\n(252)\nFree cash flow\n$\n2,817 \n$\n3,183 \nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations\nBecause we conduct business in over 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant impact on our business. Foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the comparable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this comparable impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by hypothetically translating the prior year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.11 on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2024 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.17 on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2023, if 2022 results were translated at 2023 rates.\nCurrency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of\n \n$0.12 on adjusted diluted earnings per share during the year ended December 31, 2024 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.17 on adjusted diluted earnings per share during the year ended December 31, 2023, if 2022 results were translated at 2023 rates. These translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n42\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity\nExecutive Summary\nWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity in the near-term include cash flows provided by operations and available cash reserves; primary sources of liquidity in the long-term include cash flows provided by operations, debt capacity available under our credit facilities, and capital markets. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, shareholder dividends, and Accelerating Aon United Program cash charges. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, available cash reserves, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements in the next twelve months and over the long-term.\nCash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in Fiduciary assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities.\nIn our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of funds held on behalf of clients and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Funds held on behalf of clients, because of their nature, are generally invested in highly liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. Fiduciary assets include funds held on behalf of clients of $7.2 billion and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and fiduciary receivables of $10.3 billion and $9.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. While we earn investment income on the funds held in cash and money market funds, the funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes.\nWe maintain multicurrency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2024, cash balances of one or more non-U.S. entities may have been negative; however, the overall balance was positive.\nThe following table summarizes our Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n \nStatement of Financial Position Classification\n \nAsset Type\nCash and Cash\nEquivalents\nShort-term\nInvestments\nFiduciary\nAssets\nTotal\nCertificates of deposit, bank deposits, or time deposits\n$\n1,085 \n$\n— \n$\n4,047 \n$\n5,132 \nMoney market funds\n— \n219 \n3,200 \n3,419 \nCash, Short-term investments, and funds held on behalf of clients\n1,085 \n219 \n$\n7,247 \n8,551 \nFiduciary receivables\n— \n— \n10,319 \n10,319 \nTotal\n$\n1,085 \n$\n219 \n$\n17,566 \n$\n18,870 \n43\nCash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients, including cash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients classified as held for sale, increased $611 million in 2024 compared to 2023. A summary of our cash flows provided by and used for operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows (in millions):\n \nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,035 \n$\n3,435 \nCash used for investing activities\n$\n(2,833)\n$\n(188)\nCash provided by (used for) financing activities\n$\n796 \n$\n(2,865)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients\n$\n(387)\n$\n264 \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients\n$\n611 \n$\n646 \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $3.0 billion, a decrease of $400 million compared to $3.4 billion of Cash flows provided by operating activities in the prior year. This amount represents Net income reported, generally adjusted for gains from sales of businesses, losses from sales of businesses, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization and impairments, and other non-cash income and expenses, including pension settlement charges. Adjustments also include changes in working capital, that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, collection of receivables, and payments for Accelerating Aon United Program expenses.\nPension Contributions\nPension contributions were \n$58 million for th\ne year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. In 2025, we expect to contribute approximate\nly \n$88 million i\nn c\nash to our pension plans, including contributions to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates.\nAccelerating Aon United Program Expenses\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we initiated the Accelerating Aon United Program (the “Program” or the “AAU Program”) with the purpose of streamlining our technology infrastructure, optimizing our leadership structure and resource alignment, and reducing the real estate footprint to align to our hybrid working strategy. The Program includes technology-related costs to facilitate streamlining and simplifying operations, headcount reduction costs, and costs associated with asset impairments, including real estate consolidation and technology costs. \nProgram charges are recognized within the Program’s expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and consists of the following cost activities:\n•\nTechnology and other\n – includes costs associated with actions taken to rationalize certain applications and to optimize technology across the Company. These costs may include contract termination fees and other non-capitalizable costs associated with Program initiatives, which include professional service fees.\n•\nWorkforce optimization\n – includes costs associated with headcount reduction and other separation-related costs.\n•\nAsset impairments\n – includes non-cash costs associated with impairment of assets, as they are identified, including ROU lease assets, leasehold improvements, and other capitalized assets no longer providing economic benefit.\n44\nThe changes in the Company’s liabilities for the Program as of December 31, 2024 are as follows (in millions):\nTechnology and other\nWorkforce optimization\nAsset impairments\nTotal\nLiability Balance as of January 1, 2024\n$\n14 \n$\n86 \n$\n— \n$\n100 \nCharges\n126 \n197 \n66 \n389 \nCash payments\n(96)\n(172)\n— \n(268)\nForeign currency translation and other\n— \n(3)\n— \n(3)\nNon-cash charges \n(1)\n(27)\n(11)\n(66)\n(104)\nLiability balance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n17 \n$\n97 \n$\n— \n$\n114 \nTotal costs incurred from inception to date\n$\n140 \n$\n300 \n$\n84 \n$\n524 \n(1)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $27 million of accelerated ROU asset amortization or impairments due to the Company’s decision to exit certain leased properties as a result of the Program. The amounts are presented in Technology and other, where the corresponding liability is reflected within Other current liabilities and Non-current operating lease liabilities, which will ultimately be settled in cash. \nThe Program is currently expected to result in cumulative costs of $1.0 billion, consisting of approximately $0.9 billion of cash charges and approximately $0.1 billion of non-cash c\nharges. Our Risk Capital segment is expected to incur approximately $200 million of charges, while our Human Capital segment is expected to incur approximately $50 million of charges, with the remaining charges relating to corporate expenses. The Program is estimated to generate annualized expense savings of approximately $350 million by the end of 2026, largely benefiting Compensation and benefits, Information technology,\n and Premises on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, total Program costs incurred were $389 million. The Company expects to continue to review the implementation of elements of the Program throughout the course of the Program and, therefore, there may be changes to expected timing, estimates of expected costs and related savings. The Company realized $110 million of expense savings in 2024 from Program actions, the majority of which were recognized within Compensation and benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities were $2.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $2.6 billion compared to $188 million of Cash flows used for investing activities in the prior year period. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for investing activities are acquisition of businesses, purchases of short-term investments, capital expenditures, and payments for investments. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows provided by investing activities are sales of businesses, including collection of deferred consideration in connection with prior year business divestitures, sales of short-term investments, and proceeds from investments. The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by proceeds from investments and used for payments for investments are primarily recognized in Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments decreased $150 million to $219 million at December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. The majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses\nDuring 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of 22\n businesses, \n10 within Risk Capital and 12 within Human Capital\n. Cash consideration, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients acquired, was $3.5 billion, and $4 million rel\nated to acquisitions completed in 2023. During 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of three businesses, two within Risk Capital and one within Human Capital. Cash consideration, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients acquired, was $35 million, which includes $2 million related to acquisitions completed in 2022.\nDuring 2024, the Company completed the disposition of five businesses, three within Risk Capital and two within Human Capital, for a $700 million cash inflow, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients. During 2023, the Company completed the disposition of two businesses, both within Risk Capital, for a $5 million cash inflow, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients. \n45\nCapital Expenditures\nOur additions to fixed assets including capitalized software amounted to $218 million in 2024 and $252 million \nin 2023,  \nwhich primarily relate to new build out and the refurbishing of office facilities, software development costs, and computer equipment purchases. In the current period, we continue to support certain technology projects to drive long-term growth and real estate projects to align with our Smart Working strategy, including projects related to our AAU restructuring program.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities were $796 million during the year ended December 31, 2024,compared to $2.9 billion of Cash flows used for financing activities in the prior year period. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flow provided by financing activities are issuances of debt, changes in net fiduciary liabilities, and proceeds from issuance of shares. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for financing activities are repayments of debt, partially related to the cash tender offer for the NFP Notes, share repurchases, cash paid for employee taxes on withholding shares, dividends paid to shareholders, transactions with noncontrolling interests, and other financing activities, such as payments for deferred consideration in connection with prior year business acquisitions.\nShare Repurchase Program\n We have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014, June 2017, and November 2020, and by $7.5 billion in February 2022 for a total of $27.5 billion in repurchase authorizations.\nThe following table summarizes our share repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data):\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nShares repurchased\n3.1 \n8.4 \nAverage price per share\n$\n325.56 \n$\n321.52 \nRepurchase costs recorded to accumulated deficit\n$\n1,000 \n$\n2,700 \nAt December 31, 2024, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was approximately \n$2.3 billion\n. Under the Repurchase Program, we have repurchased a total of \n172.1 million\n shares for an aggregate cost of approximately \n$25.2 billion\n.\nBorrowings\nIn December 2024, Aon Global Limited’s $750 million 3.875% Senior Notes due December 2025 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year. We expect to use cash flow from operations and available cash on hand to repay these Senior Notes.\nIn June 2024, Aon Global Limited’s $600 million 3.50% Senior Notes matured and were repaid in full.\nOn April 25, 2024, Aon North America, Inc. drew its $2 billion delayed draw term loan and used proceeds, together with the proceeds of the notes issued on March 1, 2024 described below, to pay a portion of cash consideration in connection with the acquisition of NFP, completed on April 25, 2024, (the “Transaction” or the “NFP Transaction”), to repay certain debt of NFP, and to pay related\n fees and expenses. The term loan matures on April 24, 2027 and is prepayable at any time. \nAon plc incurred $1 million of debt extinguish\nment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the delayed draw term loan. \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024, Aon North America, Inc. had repaid\n $900 million of the outstanding balance. The remaining outstanding balance is $1.1 billion. \nOn April 2, 2024, Aon plc announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Randolph Acquisition Corp., commenced cash tender offers for any and all of the outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due 2028, 4.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2028, 7.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2030 and 8.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2031, each issued by NFP Corp. (together, the “NFP Notes”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated as of April 2, 2024. The total amount tendered pursuant to the tender offers was approximately $3.3 billion, excluding premiums. On April 26, 2024, Randolph Acquisition Corp. purchased those NFP Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to April 15, 2024, effecting the early settlement of the offers (the “Early Settlement”). In addition, on April 16, 2024, NFP Corp. delivered notices of redemption of all NFP Notes not validly tendered pursuant to the offers and purchased at the Early Settlement, at a purchase price equal to the price paid to holders of the NFP Notes in connection with the Early Settlement, with a redemption date of April 26, 2024. As a result of the Early Settlement of the offers \n46\nand the related redemption which occurred on April 26, 2024, no NFP Notes remain outstanding. \nAon plc incurred $6 million of debt extinguishment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to costs related to the NFP Transaction. \nOn March 1, 2024, Aon North America, Inc. issued $600 million 5.125% Senior Notes due in March 2027\n, $1 billion 5.150% Senior Notes due in March 2029, $650 million 5.300% Senior Notes due in March 2031, $1.75 billion 5.450% Senior Notes due in March 2034, and $2 billion 5.750% Senior Notes due in March 2054, totaling to an aggregate amount of $6 billion. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including a portion of which was used to pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with the acquisition of NFP, to repay certain debt of NFP and to pay related fees and expenses.\nIn November 2023, Aon Global Limited’s $350 million 4.00% Senior Notes matured and were repaid in full.\nOn February 28, 2023, Aon Corporation and Aon Global Holdings plc co-issued $750 million 5.35% Senior Notes due in February 2033. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.\nAon Corporation has established a U.S. commercial paper program (the “U.S. Program”) and Aon Global Holdings plc has established a European multi-currency commercial paper program (the “European Program” and, together with the U.S. Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”). Commercial paper may be issued in aggregate principal amounts of up to approximately $1.3 billion under the U.S. Program and €625 million ($651 million at December 31, 2024 exchange rates) under the European Program, not to exceed the amount of our committed credit facilities, which was $2.0 billion at December 31, 2024. The aggregate capacity of the Commercial Paper Programs remain fully backed by our committed credit facilities. Commercial paper activity during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in millions):\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nTotal issuances \n(1)\n$\n1,871 \n$\n4,835 \nTotal repayments\n(2,462)\n(4,862)\nNet issuances (repayments)\n$\n(591)\n$\n(27)\n(1)   The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nDistributable Profits\nWe are required under Irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable profits are created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and, among other methods, through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Ireland. Distributable profits are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., Accumulated deficit). As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had distributable profits in excess of $29.7 billion and $27.5 billion, respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future. \nRevolving Credit Facilities\nWe expect cash generated by operations for 2024 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: its $1.0 billion multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in September 2027 and its $1.0 billion multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2028. In aggregate, these two facilities provide $2.0 billion in available credit.\nEach of these primary committed credit facilities and the delayed draw term loan includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, in each case, tested quarterly. We did not have borrowings under either of these primary committed credit facilities as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, we are in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the rolling year ended December 31, 2024.\n47\nShelf Registration Statement\nOn June 22, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, class A ordinary shares and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.\nRating Agency Ratings\nThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 18, 2025 appear in the table below.\nRatings\n \nSenior Long-term Debt\n \nCommercial Paper\n \nOutlook\nStandard & Poor’s\nA-\nA-2\nNegative\nMoody’s Investor Services\nBaa2\nP-2\nStable\nFitch, Inc.\nBBB+\nF-2\nStable\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Fitch, Inc. upgraded our ‘BBB+’ outlook to Stable, as compared to a Negative outlook at October 25, 2024 reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nLetters of Credit and Other Guarantees\nWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit. We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $124 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $86 million at December 31, 2023. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian secure non-qualified pension plan schemes, reinsurance obligations related to our own E&O liability insurance program, and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.\nWe have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $162 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $194 million at December 31, 2023.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2024 are comprised of principal payments on debt, interest payments on debt, operating leases, pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and purchase obligations.\nOperating leases are primarily comprised of leased office space throughout the world. As leases expire, we do not anticipate difficulty in negotiating renewals or finding other satisfactory space if the premise becomes unavailable. In certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved. As part of our AAU restructuring program, we are reducing our real estate footprint to align with our hybrid working strategy. Refer to Note 9 “Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information.\nPension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the ERISA and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions.

To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.\nIn accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, income taxes, restructuring, and business combinations, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, we assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate consideration based on their relative fair values.\nCosts incurred in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract-related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.\nRisk Capital\nCommercial Risk Solutions\n includes retail brokerage, specialty solutions, global risk consulting and captives management, and Affinity programs. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. For \n51\narrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. \nReinsurance Solutions \nincludes treaty reinsurance, facultative reinsurance, Strategy and Technology Group, and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly for treaty reinsurance arrangements, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums.\nHuman Capital\nHealth Solutions\n includes consulting and brokerage, consumer benefits, and talent advisory services. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using input or output methods to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Fo\nr Talent, reve\nnue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of the services. For arrangements recognized over time, revenue is based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation, including units delivered or time elapsed. Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed. Revenue from Consumer Benefits Solutions arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.\nWealth Solutions \nincludes retirement consulting, pension administration and investments. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Revenue generated from our delegated investment business is generally earned as an agreed percentage based on AUM and, to a lesser extent, based on performance fees. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.\nPensions\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted.\nThe service cost component of NPPC is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income (expense). We used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of NPPC for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\n52\nRecognition of Gains and Losses and Prior Service\nCertain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of NPPC.\nUnrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into expense as a component of NPPC based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or PBO. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.\nThe following table discloses our accumulated other comprehensive loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the loss, and the estimated 2025 amortization of loss by country (in millions, except amortization period):\nU.K.\nU.S.\nOther\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss \n$\n1,897 \n$\n1,276 \n$\n414 \nAmortization period\n6 to 23 years\n5  to 24 years\n9  to 32 years\nEstimated 2025 amortization of loss\n$\n89 \n$\n35 \n$\n13 \nThe U.S. had no unrecognized prior service cost (credit) \nat December 31, 2024. The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2024 was $43 million, and $(5) million for the U.K. and other plans, respectively.\nFor the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of NPPC recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our NPPC will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2024, the market-related value of assets was $1.7 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of plan assets was $1.4 billion. Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.\nRate of Return on Plan Assets and Asset Allocation\nThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2024:\nU.K.\nU.S.\nOther\nExpected return on plan assets, net of administration expenses\n5.24%\n7.08%\n4.35 - 4.90%\nIn determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.\nThe U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.\nImpact of Changing Economic Assumptions\nChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.\n53\nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our PBO at December 31, 2024 (in millions):\nIncrease (decrease) in projected benefit obligation \n(1)\n25 BPS Change in Discount Rate\nIncrease\nDecrease\nU.K. plans\n$\n(77)\n$\n80 \nU.S. plans\n$\n(46)\n$\n47 \nOther plans\n$\n(38)\n$\n41 \n(1)\nIncreases to the PBO reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the PBO are recoveries toward fully-funded status. A change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the PBO.\nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2025 pension expense (in millions):\n \n25 BPS Change in Discount Rate\nIncrease (decrease) in expense\nIncrease\nDecrease\nU.K. plans\n$\n(2)\n$\n2 \nU.S. plans\n$\n1 \n$\n(1)\nOther plans\n$\n— \n$\n— \nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2025 pension expense (in millions):\n \n25 BPS Change in Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nIncrease (decrease) in expense\nIncrease\nDecrease\nU.K. plans\n$\n(8)\n$\n8 \nU.S. plans\n$\n(4)\n$\n4 \nOther plans\n$\n(3)\n$\n3 \nEstimated Future Contributions\nWe estimate cash cont\nributions of approximately \n$88 million\n to our pension plans in 2025 as compared with cash contributions of $58 million in \n2024.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either customer-related and contract-based, technology, tradenames or other intangibles.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. \nA reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components are a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.\nWhen evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a quantitative analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \n54\nWhen determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a DCF model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry.\nDuring the year-ended December 31, 2024, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment at the reporting unit level which was defined as components of the Company’s operating segments. This assessment considered the factors described above, where we concluded that goodwill was not impaired.\nWe review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that an asset group’s carrying value may not be recoverable. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations\n.\nContingencies\nWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until all contingencies are resolved.\nShare-Based Payments\nShare-based compensation expense is generally measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. For purposes of measuring share-based compensation expense, we consider whether an adjustment to the observable market price is necessary to reflect material nonpublic information that is known to us at the time the award is granted. No adjustments were necessary for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022. We also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nRestricted Share Units\nRSUs are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.\nPerformance Share Awards\nPSAs are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group, or company level. We typically estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.\nCompensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved, which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.\nThe largest plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. The 2022 to 2024 performance period ended on December 31, 2024, the 2021 to 2023 performance period ended on December 31, 2023, and the 2020 to 2022 performance period ended on December 31, 2022. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2023 to 2025 and 2024 to 2026. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2024 expense by approximately $9 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $9 million. \n55\nIncome Taxes\nWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. \nThe carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances are evaluated quarterly and are subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors.\nWe assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. \nWe base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.\nAccelerating Aon United Program\nRestructuring charges related to the AAU Program are recognized within Accelerating Aon United Program expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and consists of the following cost activities:\nWorkforce optimization costs\nSeverance and related costs are generally determined based on amounts due under established severance plans. Typically, severance benefits are recognized when it is probable the benefit will be paid, and the amount is reasonably estimable. Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. \nAsset impairments for fixed assets\nAsset impairments relate to fixed assets and are accounted for in the period when they become known by revising the useful life of fixed assets when there is a change in the estimated future benefits in or use of the asset, accordingly depreciation is accelerated to reflect the revised useful life.\nLeases\nFor leased properties where we plan to permanently cease use of a space and have the intent and ability to sublease the property, we will test the ROU asset for impairment to determine if an impairment has occurred. The test for impairment will adjust the book value of the asset based on the net present value of the future cash flows expected from a sublease agreement using current market information for similar properties.\nFor properties where we plan to permanently cease use of a space and have no intent or ability to sublease the property, the amortization of the ROU asset will be accelerated and recognized on a straight-line basis from the decision date to the cease use date.\nFor the remaining lease term, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income could impact the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOther associated costs of exit and disposal activities\nWe recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred, including professional services fees, certain technology-related costs, moving costs, contract termination costs, and other costs.\n56\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination are recognized at their acquisition-date fair values. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangible assets, requires us to make estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. These estimates directly impact the fair value of identified intangible assets recognized, the estimated useful lives, and the related amortization expense in future periods. We may refine our estimates and adjust the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable.",
