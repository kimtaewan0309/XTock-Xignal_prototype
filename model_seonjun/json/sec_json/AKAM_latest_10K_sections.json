Business\nOverview\nAkamai's mission is to power and protect life online.\nSince 1998, Akamai has developed and provided solutions for global enterprises to build, secure and accelerate their applications and digital experiences. Our massively distributed global network is comprised of core and distributed compute sites, more than 4,300 edge points-of-presence in approximately 130 countries and over 700 cities, and our underlying global network integrated with roughly 1,200 network partners. With this scale and distribution, Akamai has visibility and insight into traffic volumes, congestion, attack patterns, vulnerabilities and other activities across the internet's complex intersections of networks and systems. Leveraging these insights, Akamai offers solutions designed to protect our customers from threats and attacks, along with full-stack compute solutions to build and deliver distributed, low-latency applications on our globally distributed network.\nToday, billions of people work, learn, shop, bank, communicate and do more online globally. We firmly believe that the internet’s role in transforming the way we exchange ideas and information and conduct business is more vital than ever. Our strategy is to help continue to power and protect business online by offering security and compute services with the industry-leading reliability, scale and expertise our customers need to grow their business with confidence.\nOur Solutions\nWe provide solutions in three core offerings: security, delivery and compute. We also provide services and support for our customers as they utilize our solutions. As part of our mission to make life better for millions of businesses, trillions of times per day, Akamai is committed to enabling our customers to benefit from the latest technology developments. In recent years, artificial intelligence (\"AI\") has been a major focus of corporate initiatives for enterprises in multiple verticals and across the globe. To help our customers seize on the power and potential of AI, we provide cloud computing infrastructure that they can use to build AI-powered applications; cybersecurity solutions, powered by AI and automation, designed to defend against prompt injections, data exfiltration and toxic outputs; generative AI to improve the speed and efficiency of identifying and investigating malicious or suspect activity; and throughput on our global intelligent network to enable the large volumes of data required to power AI-powered applications and facilitate effective real-time protections.\nSecurity\nOur security solutions, threat intelligence and global operations team work to provide defense in depth to safeguard enterprise data and applications. Customers trust Akamai to help keep infrastructure, websites, applications, application \n3\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nprogramming interfaces (\"APIs\"), networks and users safe from a multitude of cyberattacks and online threats while improving performance. With insight and automation derived from the world’s most distributed global network, our solutions blend robust automation with customizable protections and managed security services to enable businesses to effectively manage risk and maximize protections. Akamai’s web application and API protection solutions protect web, API and mobile app traffic from attacks that take advantage of security flaws, protection from malicious automated attacks, credential abuse and account takeover, client-side protections that protect end customers from malicious or vulnerable first- and third-party client-side scripts that can lead to audience hijacking and distributed denial of service (\"DDoS\") mitigation. As adversaries relentlessly refine their evasion techniques, it requires continuous innovation in threat detection and specialized defenses to stay ahead of advanced bot and abuse attacks. Our Bot & Abuse portfolio provides tailored, specialized solutions to help customers protect against these threats. Akamai Account Protector offers full account lifecycle protections including the ability to defend against account takeover and opening abuse, adversarial bot protection, protection against credential stuffing, inventory scalping and hoarding. Akamai Content Protector also helps businesses protect their intellectual property, reputation and revenue potential with solutions designed to stop persistent scrapers from stealing content that can be used for malicious purposes like competitive intelligence/espionage, inventory manipulation, site performance degradation and counterfeiting.\nIn May 2023, Akamai acquired Neosec, Inc. (\"Neosec\"), which enabled us to offer a solution we refer to as API Security that works to discover and audit APIs and monitor API activity. API Security complements our application and API security portfolio by extending our visibility into the growing API threat landscape to detect and respond to threats and abuse detection and operates using a response platform based on data and behavioral analytics. In June 2024, Akamai acquired Noname Security Ltd. (\"Noname Security\"), one of the top API security vendors in the market. This enhanced Akamai’s API Security solution and accelerated our ability to meet growing customer demand and market requirements as the use of APIs continues to expand. Akamai also expects to gain greater scale with Noname Security’s additional sales and marketing resources and established channel and alliance relationships. As a result of the acquisition, Akamai expects to offer a complete API security suite enabling customers to better discover “shadow” APIs and detect vulnerabilities and attacks. Akamai’s enhanced offering expects to have greater deployment choices for customers and access to a portfolio of technology integrations that we believe is unrivaled in the market.\nWe also offer microservice and application component protection that analyzes and protects application traffic that moves between application components like containers, APIs and workloads. This is part of a growing set of solutions designed to help businesses implement a Zero Trust security architecture. Our acquisition of Guardicore Ltd. (\"Guardicore\") in October 2021 has enabled us to deliver the Akamai Guardicore Platform, which simplifies enterprise security with broad visibility and granular controls through one console. The Akamai Guardicore Platform simply and efficiently enables Zero Trust through a fully integrated combination of microsegmentation, Zero Trust Network Access, multi-factor authentication, domain name system (\"DNS\") firewall and threat hunting. Guardicore’s microsegmentation solution helps our customers prevent malicious lateral movement in their network through precise segmentation policies, visuals of activity within their IT environment and network security alerts. The platform leverages AI to simplify user experience, vulnerability assessments, compliance and incident response, helping to protect businesses from the threat of ransomware. AI network labeling examines how assets are behaving and suggests labels to help security teams apply appropriate controls, and generative AI allows security professionals to ask natural language questions of their network, instead of manually poring through logs, to drastically expedite a variety of use cases like compliance scoping and incident response.\nCompute\nAkamai's cloud computing services, which we sometimes refer to as compute, include compute, storage, networking, database and container management services that are required to build, deploy and secure applications and workloads. The cloud computing services running on Akamai's compute platform enable companies to distribute workloads and applications across our core to edge infrastructure to help solve the cost, performance and scale challenges that centralized cloud computing platforms present today.\nIn March 2022, Akamai acquired Linode Limited Liability Company (\"Linode\"), an established cloud computing platform. This acquisition was a significant milestone in our expansion into cloud computing. While Linode was traditionally focused on individual developers, we are leveraging the Linode cloud computing services for enterprise customers by building new enterprise-grade core computing regions and connecting them to the Akamai network, which we believe will give Akamai an advantage over its bigger cloud rivals. Akamai provides a continuum of compute solutions for developers to build and deliver distributed, low-latency applications. We empower businesses to build and deploy massively scalable applications, distribute them to reduce latency and reach underserved locations and work to optimize and secure experiences and data from the core to the digital touchpoint. Akamai’s compute solutions include a broad set of distributed cloud and edge computing services, including virtual machines, graphical processing units, cloud storage and databases, network optimization and security services \n4\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nand lightweight serverless functions to help businesses build, deploy and manage applications and workloads with superior performance and affordability on the world’s most distributed platform.\nIn 2024, we expanded Akamai's compute platform to span 41 datacenters in 36 locations. This includes upgrades to 5 existing datacenters and the introduction of 11 datacenters. The locations of these datacenters include Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; Querétaro, Mexico; Bogotá, Colombia; Santiago, Chile; Marseille, France; Hamburg, Germany; Johannesburg, South Africa; Auckland, New Zealand; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Melbourne, Australia. Distributed compute regions provide access to powerful dedicated compute, storage and networking services in major metros that lack cloud computing options and availability, enabling organizations to place compute-intensive workloads as close as possible to end users. These regions act as an extension of primary infrastructure deployed in core compute regions for organizations that aim to improve application performance to attract new customers in new or target regions, and/or stabilize performance to meet user expectations. We also introduced new NVIDIA graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") to provide better productivity and economics for companies in the media and entertainment industry that are challenged with processing video content faster and more efficiently, and for organizations seeking to deploy AI inferencing workloads closer to end users. These GPUs are well-suited for video transcoding and live video streaming, virtual reality and augmented reality content, gaming and graphics rendering, training and inference with neural networks, data analysis and scientific computing and high-performance computing applications, such as modeling and simulation, that require fast and efficient processing of large amounts of data. \nIn November 2024, we launched the Akamai App Platform, a ready-to-run solution that makes it easy to deploy, manage and scale highly distributed applications. The Akamai App Platform is built on top of the cloud native Kubernetes technology Otomi, which Akamai acquired from Red Kubes Holding B.V. and its subsidiary earlier in the year. The application platform provides ready-to-run templates that address common challenges in deploying, managing and scaling Kubernetes clusters at scale. Instead of relying on multiple departments and spending months sourcing, connecting and configuring the software needed to operate Kubernetes fleets, Akamai’s solution automates the provisioning process, allowing developers to build and deploy highly distributed applications in a few clicks. This can cut deployment time from months to less than an hour and provides near-instant scaling as production workloads grow.\nDelivery\nOur delivery solutions consist primarily of web and mobile performance focused solutions and media delivery solutions. Our web and mobile performance solutions are architected to enable dynamic websites and applications to have rapid response times, no matter where the user is, what device or browser they are using or how they are connected to the internet. These services leverage intelligent performance optimization and real-time monitoring, origin offload and network reliability and insights that enable enterprises to identify and address performance issues. Akamai web and mobile performance capabilities also include global traffic management, site acceleration, application load balancing, large-scale load testing and real-user monitoring.\nOur media delivery solutions are designed to enable enterprises to execute their digital media distribution strategies by addressing volume and global reach requirements, improving the end-user experience, boosting reliability and reducing the cost of internet-related infrastructure. Underlying these solutions is technology to address variable connection speeds and device types, facilitate access to disparate locations around the world, accelerate large file downloads, reliably deliver high-quality live content across various devices and platforms and enable comprehensive insights and real-time online video monitoring. Akamai media delivery solutions include video streaming and video player services, game and software delivery, broadcast operations, authoritative DNS, resolution and data and analytics.\nServices and Support\nWe provide an array of service and support offerings across our core offerings. Through our service and support offerings we work closely with our customers to develop creative and tailored solutions to assist them with integrating, configuring, optimizing and managing our core offerings. Customers can rely on our professional services and security experts for customized solutions, problem resolution and 24/7 customer support. Additional features are available to enterprises that purchase our premium and managed security solutions, including a dedicated technical account team, proactive service monitoring, custom technical support handling, security traffic monitoring, technical security reviews, threat advisories and emergency support for security events.\n5\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nHuman Capital\nOur employees – our human capital – are our most valuable resources as they are fundamental to our innovation, the operation and ongoing enhancement of Akamai's solutions and global network, the fostering and maintenance of relationships with our customers and the management of our operations. The importance of our workforce to our success is underscored by the inclusion of corporate mission critical goals centered on our employees. In 2024, we continued to focus on fostering a community that enables employees to be productive, and continuing to deliver a positive experience for both employees and customers by living our values each day. Different aspects of our human capital management are overseen by our board of directors as well as its Talent, Leadership and Compensation Committee and Environmental, Social and Governance Committee.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had over 10,700 employees located in more than 30 countries (with approximately 65% of those employees located outside of the U.S.) and representing over 100 nationalities, all of which we believe helps bring a global perspective to our operations. Our employees are grouped across the following roles, with the approximate percentage of the overall population noted: engineering and research and development (36%), services and support (27%), sales and marketing (17%) and administrative functions (20%).\nEngagement \nWe continue to recognize that an engaged employee workforce is key to having the productive, ethical and high-performing workplace needed to successfully compete in today’s marketplace. We conduct quarterly surveys of our entire employee population to assess a variety of key metrics related to important topics, such as engagement, inclusion and overall job satisfaction. Results from these surveys have consistently shown a strong sense of engagement and confidence in Akamai’s future. We have been acknowledged in respected publications across the U.S., India and Poland, among other countries, as a great place to work. Continuing in 2024, all employees were able to participate in a company-wide program, developed by a behavioral research organization, that was intended to help us increase inclusive behaviors, become more open to change and accelerate our innovation. In addition, we work closely with the Akamai Foundation, to provide community service and charitable matching fund opportunities for Akamai employees, endeavors that have been shown to increase employee engagement. The Akamai Compassion Fund was created in 2020, by employees for employees, with support from the Akamai Foundation, and continues to provide a way for Akamai employees to unite and support global colleagues and their families during times of unexpected hardships following a catastrophic event, such as climate events (e.g., hurricane, mudslide, wildfire) and ongoing wars and armed conflicts around the world.\nRepresentation\nAkamai is an equal opportunity employer that values the strength that diverse perspectives bring to the workplace. We do not tolerate discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, protected veteran status, disability, or other protected group status. Akamai supports a variety of programs and practices designed to support an optimal working environment. We have eight employee resource groups (\"ERGs\") that offer opportunities for employees to come together for mutual support, education and development. ERGs encompass different racial and ethnic groups, persons with different physical or cognitive abilities, parents, military veterans, the LGBTQIA+ community and women and are open to all employees. \nRetention\nWe have a demonstrated history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, wages and benefits. Our compensation and benefits philosophy is to maximize the effectiveness of pay and benefits programs to attract and retain the high caliber individuals needed to drive the success of our business, while balancing cost-effectiveness and competitive factors. Our benefits programs (which vary by country and region) include healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules and locations, adoption and fertility assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and holistic wellness programs. Our wellness programs include educational offerings on healthy lifestyles, access to mental health experts, access to ergonomic advice and equipment and financial wellness support. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, stock awards are held by the vast majority of our employees under our broad-based stock incentive programs and most employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan. We monitor voluntary attrition in assessing our overall human capital. Attrition was slightly up in 2024 when compared to 2023.\n6\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nWe conduct annual internal pay equity analyses (with the assistance of a nationally-recognized outside consultant), and we take action to remedy identified discrepancies when we believe it is appropriate. To date, no widespread patterns of disparity have been identified. \nIn addition, succession planning is an ongoing priority for our leadership. We conduct annual succession planning for senior leadership, which is overseen by our board of directors, including development plans for the next level of our senior leaders. Annual talent reviews focus on both high performers as well as those with high potential to keep a full pipeline of tomorrow’s leaders.\nDevelopment\nWe invest significant resources in professional development, career advancement and training for our global workforce. All employees are eligible to participate in our Akamai Elevation performance review program, which provides guidance around setting annual performance objectives, developing competencies and receiving feedback. Where appropriate, we offer leadership training workshops, 360-degree feedback and succession planning exercises to encourage and enable internal promotion and advancement. As a result of these investments and others, nearly 15% of open positions were filled with internal candidates in 2024. All employees are required to complete annual ethics and compliance and data security training. In addition to these required trainings, nearly all of our employees and contractors completed at least one training in our Akamai University program during 2024.\nFlexBase\nIn May 2022, we launched FlexBase, which is a flexible work arrangement that allows over 95% of employees to choose to work from their home office, a Company office, an approved workspace or a combination. We believe that a focus on employee choice makes us a more attractive employer, increases productivity, enables us to recruit from a broader and more varied pool of applicants and presents additional growth and development opportunities for our employees. Since 2022, we have rolled out a number of tools and resources to support this program, such as supporting employees with guidance on maximizing our internal tools to deliver great virtual meeting experiences. In addition, we have invested in ensuring that workplace connection remains strong and developed a framework for understanding, measuring and optimizing workplace connection, named CLEAR Connections. CLEAR stands for Colleague, Leader, Employer and Role. We measure each dimension in a quarterly anonymous survey, which allows us to track and report on workplace connection around the world.\nCustomers\nOur customers include many of the world's leading corporations, such as Adobe, Aflac, Airbnb, Asus, Autodesk, Carnival Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company, Comcast, Daiwa Institute of Research, eBay, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Fidelity Investments, Honda, Japan Airlines, Liberty Mutual, Maersk Transportation & Logistics, Marriott, NBCUniversal, Panasonic, Panera Bread, Paramount Global, Philips, Rabobank, Riot Games, Sony Interactive Entertainment, RTL, Spotify, Telefonica, Toshiba, Ubisoft, WarnerMedia and The Washington Post. We also actively sell to government agencies. As of December 31, 2024, our public-sector customers included the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nNo customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Less than 10% of our total revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government.\nSales, Services and Marketing\nWe market and sell our solutions globally through our field sales and services organization and through many channel partners, including Apukay, AT&T, Avant, BV Tech, Carahsoft, CPD, Deloitte, Deutsche Telecom, Doyen, Kyndryl, Macnica, Microsoft Azure, Netpoleon, Telefonica Group and WWT. In addition to entering into agreements with resellers, we have several other types of sales and marketing focused alliances with entities such as system integrators, application service providers, technology solution distributors, referral partners and marketplaces. By aligning with these partners, we believe we are better able to market our solutions and leverage partners to add valuable services to complement our offerings and improve the customer experience. Our sales, services and marketing professionals are based in locations across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific and focus on direct and channel sales, sales operations, professional services, account management and technical consulting. \n7\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nTo support our sales efforts and promote the Akamai brand, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs to shape perception and drive awareness and consideration of our solutions. Our integrated marketing strategies include public relations, digital programmatic advertising, paid search and SEO marketing, content marketing, social media, strategic alliances, e-mail marketing programs, events and webinars, participation at industry trade shows and ongoing training and sales enablement.\nCompetition\nThe market for our solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations. We expect competition for our offerings to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants. We compete primarily on the basis of:\n•\nthe performance and reliability of our solutions;\n•\nmassive distribution and availability of our network;\n•\nreturn on investment in terms of cost savings and new revenue opportunities for our customers;\n•\nreduced infrastructure complexity;\n•\nsophistication and functionality of our offerings;\n•\nour long-term product roadmaps and ability to quickly innovate;\n•\nscalability;\n•\nsecurity; \n•\nease of implementation and use of service;\n•\nfirst-party global services and support across products;\n•\ncustomer support; and\n•\nprice.\nWe compete with companies offering products and services that provide internet content delivery and hosting services, security and cloud computing solutions, technologies used by carriers to improve the efficiency of their systems, streaming content delivery services and equipment-based solutions for internet performance problems, such as load balancers and server switches. Other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertising-based billing or revenue-sharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet. In addition, existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware, software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a third-party provider like us. Our security solutions compete with those offered by both hardware and software providers. While our compute solutions have historically competed with alternative cloud computing platforms focused on individual developers, we anticipate that going forward our compute solutions will increasingly compete with the large so-called “hyper-scaler” cloud computing providers.\nWe believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through our global scale, reliability and expertise, which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us. In our view, we also benefit from the high quality of our offerings, our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a global technology company, Akamai is subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations in areas such as data privacy and localization, cybersecurity, liability for content delivered over our network, various internet regulations, bribery, sanctions, export controls, competition, tax and foreign exchange controls. \nPrivacy laws, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, impact how we use data generated from our network as well as our ability to reach current and prospective customers, understand how our solutions are being used, transfer data about our employees and respond to customer requests allowed under the applicable laws. Other laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to, among other things, content liability, security and disclosure requirements, critical infrastructure designations, internet resiliency, law enforcement access to information, net neutrality, so-called \"fair share\" or internet content taxes, data localization requirements, industry regulations applicable to key suppliers to some of our customers and restrictions on social media or other content can have an impact on our business. For instance, regulations have been enacted or proposed in a number of countries that limit the delivery of certain types of content into those countries. As an example, restrictions were adopted in India in 2020 prohibiting access to identified Chinese-owned applications. Enactment and expansion of such laws and regulations in other jurisdictions would negatively impact our revenues or cause us to incur costs to redesign our systems to ensure compliance. In addition, in April 2024, the U.S. government passed legislation that prohibited the provision of certain types of services to a Chinese application if the \n8\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\napplication was not sold to a neutral third party by January 19, 2025. The Chinese application was not sold to a neutral third party by the January 19th deadline, but President Trump subsequently signed an executive order instructing the U.S. Attorney General to not take any action to enforce the passed legislation for a period of 75 days from January 20, 2025. The Attorney General has since determined that our provision of services to this customer has not violated the law and that we can continue providing services as contemplated by the Executive Order without violating the law and without incurring any legal liability. It is difficult to predict whether the passed legislation will ultimately be enforced and whether any future judicial challenges brought against the executive order will be successful. Even though President Trump has extended the enforcement deadline for a ban on the Chinese application, there is no assurance that we will not be exposed to liability and we may be exposed to significant fines, litigation, indemnification claims, negative publicity, reputational harm, diversion of management attention, interruptions in our operations, financial loss and other similar harms by continuing to provide services to the Chinese application. \n \nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering payments or inducements to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. To the extent we export technical services, data, products or other technology outside of the U.S., we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports, including, but not limited to, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and sanctions against embargoed countries and other designated entities and individuals.\nMany of these laws and regulations are evolving and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business. For example, while we are generally not subject to regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, new or different interpretations of laws or regulations could subject us to regulatory supervision. In general, the nature and breadth of laws and regulations governing the internet may increase in the future; accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFor further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business, see the related discussion below in Item 1A. Risk Factors – Financial and Operational Risks – We face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business; – Legal and Regulatory Risks – Evolving privacy regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations; and – Legal and Regulatory Risks – Other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. As of December 31, 2024, we owned, or had exclusive rights to, over 560 U.S. patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries. Our U.S.-issued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2025 and 2043. We do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be materially detrimental to our business. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.\nAdditional Information\nOur internet website address is www.akamai.com. We make available, free of charge, on or through our internet website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments thereto that we have filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the Commission. We also use our \nhttps://www.ir.akamai.com\n website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. We are not, however, including the information contained on our website, or information that may be accessed through links on our website, as part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K. \n9\nTable \nof\n Content\ns",
  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\"), should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof.\nOverview\nWe develop and provide solutions for global enterprises to build, secure and accelerate their applications and digital experiences through our massively distributed global network, which underpins our security, delivery and compute solutions, and is central to our financial success. The key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments, increase traffic on our network, continue to develop, scale and successfully bring to market our compute platform and compute-to-edge solutions that meet the needs of professional users and enterprises, including with respect to reliability, effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions, develop new products and appropriately manage our capital spending and other expenses. The purpose of this discussion and analysis section is to provide material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations from management’s perspective, including to describe and explain key trends, events and other factors that impacted our reported results and that are likely to impact our future performance.\nRevenue\nWe primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers pursuant to contracts having terms of one year or longer, which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue. Services included in our contracts consist of security solutions, the delivery of content, applications and software over the internet, compute solutions and professional services. In addition to a base level of revenue, we are also dependent on our ability to increase our product offerings and to cross-sell additional services to our new and existing customers, particularly for our security and compute solutions portfolios. \n26\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nOur revenue is also impacted by customer renewals and the pricing for such renewals, the rate of adoption and timing of customer offerings, variability of one-time events, usage of compute services and the amount of traffic we serve on our network. Geopolitical, economic and other developments that impact our customers' businesses can also impact our ability to attract new customers or continue to cross-sell additional services to existing customers and traffic levels for customers with variable usage. Over the longer term, our ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are key factors impacting our revenue growth.\nWe have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years:\n•\nIncreased sales of our security solutions, led by application security solutions and segmentation solutions from our acquisition of Guardicore Ltd., and increased sales of our compute solutions, attributable to our acquisition of Linode Limited Liability Company (\"Linode\") and enhanced services on our compute platform, have made a significant contribution to revenue growth. Our security and compute solutions represented over two-thirds of our total revenue during 2024. We plan to continue to invest in these areas with a focus on further advancing our product portfolios and sales capabilities.\n•\nTraffic on our network has moderated as compared to prior years. We, and the industry more broadly, are seeing growth at a slower pace than we have experienced in the past. In particular, we are seeing traffic growth slowing in verticals such as media and gaming, as these customers optimize their traffic and manage through underlying business challenges at a time of global economic and geopolitical headwinds. For instance, a large social media customer has taken steps to lower costs and reduce reliance on U.S. providers by optimizing its platform, including using a “do-it-yourself” component, which has reduced traffic on our network and negatively impacted our revenue in 2024. We expect this trend to continue in 2025. If our customers' businesses continue to be impacted by economic and geopolitical headwinds, they may reduce their spending, optimize their traffic or may increase their reliance on “do-it-yourself” solutions, which may negatively impact traffic on our network and revenue. \n•\nThe prices paid by some of our delivery and security customers have declined in recent years due to competition and contract renewals, which negatively impacts our revenue growth rates. We have been able to mitigate some of the negative impacts to our revenue growth rates by upselling incremental solutions to our existing customers. We continue to take steps upon contract renewals to sign customers to multi-year contracts and to optimize how we charge certain high-volume traffic customers to maintain alignment between customer traffic volumes and unit pricing.\n•\nRevenue from our international operations continues to grow, particularly from new customer acquisition and cross-selling of incremental solutions. Because we publicly report in U.S. dollars, our reported revenue results are negatively impacted when the dollar strengthens and benefit when the dollar weakens.\n•\nWe have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter-to-quarter. These quarterly variations in revenue are attributable to, among other things, the timing of large customer contract renewals; the frequency and timing of purchases of custom solutions or licensed software; the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers; holiday season activity; and whether there are large live sporting or other events or situations that impact the amount of media traffic on our network.\nExpenses\nOur level of profitability is impacted by our expenses, including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and co-location costs, which includes energy to power our network. We have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years:\n•\nCo-location costs are a significant portion of our cost of revenue. As we continue to build out our new compute locations to provide us with the ability to scale our platform, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, longer term leases that include certain financial commitments in order to achieve more favorable unit economics. The costs of the financial commitments are expensed ratably over the lease term, and, as a result, in some cases, we are incurring costs in advance of these compute locations being fully utilized. We continue to improve our internal-use software and remain disciplined in managing our hardware deployments, which enables us to use servers more efficiently. We will continue to effectively manage our co-location costs.\n•\nNetwork bandwidth costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue. Historically, we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs through investment in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. We will continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs.\n27\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\n•\nNetwork build-out and supporting service costs represent another significant portion of our cost of revenue. These costs include maintenance and supporting services incurred as we continue to build out our compute platform and maintain our global network, and costs of third-party cloud providers used for some of our operations. We have seen these costs increase in recent years as a result of our network expansion, and particularly the build out of our compute platform. We previously experienced increased costs from third-party cloud providers, but continue to mitigate those costs by migrating to our own compute solutions and working to optimize third-party cloud spend. We will continue to effectively manage our network build-out and supporting service costs and continue to migrate third-party cloud services to our compute platform in an effort to manage costs.\n•\nOur employees are core to the operations of our business, and payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, is our largest expense. It is important to the success of operations that we offer competitive compensation packages. However, we are focused on remaining disciplined in allocating our resources to support our faster growing security and compute solutions, including maintaining operational efficiencies to mitigate the rising cost of talent. In 2023 we redesigned one of our non-executive short-term incentive compensation programs by shifting certain employees from a cash-based to stock-based program, and in 2024 we transitioned more employees to this program. During 2023, we also introduced a non-executive incentive program tied to our initiative to migrate certain third-party cloud services onto Akamai's platform. These programs were designed to better align employee incentives with the interests of our stockholders, which increased our stock-based compensation. \n•\nDepreciation expense related to our network equipment also contributes to our overall expense levels. In recent years, we have invested in our network, particularly as part of building out our compute infrastructure, which increased our capital expenditures and resulting depreciation expense. We are also experiencing an increase in certain server component costs that support the continued build out of our compute platform. We plan to continue to make investments in capital expenditures, including to support recently acquired contracts, and focus investments on our faster growing compute solutions, including support for a new enterprise compute customer. \n•\nGrowth in our international operations incrementally increases our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Because we publicly report in U.S. dollars, our expenses are positively impacted when the dollar strengthens and are negatively impacted when the dollar weakens.\nRecent Acquisitions\nWe acquired certain customer contracts from Edgio, Inc. (\"Edgio\") in December 2024 as part of a bankruptcy process. This acquisition is intended to further strengthen our existing delivery and other businesses as we transition the acquired customers to our platform and offer our portfolio of other services to them. We also acquired Noname Gate Ltd. (\"Noname Security\") in June 2024. Noname Security is intended to expand our existing API Security offering by providing more flexible deployment options, extensive vendor integrations and enhanced attack analysis. We believe this acquisition will accelerate our ability to meet increasing customer and market demand. As part of the acquisition, we integrated approximately 200 Noname Security employees primarily within sales and marketing and research and development.\nWe acquired certain customer contracts from Lumen Technologies, Inc. (\"Lumen\") in October 2023 and from StackPath, LLC (\"StackPath\") in August 2023. These acquisitions are intended to further strengthen our existing delivery and other businesses as we transition the acquired customers to our platform and offer our portfolio of other services to them. We also acquired Neosec, Inc (\"Neosec\") in May 2023, which is intended to complement our application and API security portfolio by extending its visibility into the rapidly growing API threat landscape, and StorageOS, Inc. (\"StorageOS\"), also known as Ondat, in March 2023, which is intended to strengthen our compute offerings. Neither Neosec or Ondat included a significant number of employees when we completed the acquisitions.\nIn March 2022, we acquired Linode, an infrastructure-as-a-service platform provider, which allows for developer-friendly cloud computing capabilities. The acquisition was intended to enhance our compute services by enabling us to create a unique cloud platform to build, run and secure applications from the cloud to the edge. Linode had approximately 250 employees when we completed the acquisition.\n28\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nGlobal Economic Conditions\nGlobal macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions continue to impact our customers, as well as our business and revenue growth rates. We, along with our customers, continue to manage through an uncertain period of fluctuating inflation, regulations that may negatively impact business, economic and political uncertainty, uncertain energy supplies, heightened geopolitical tensions and conflict, potential for supply chain disruptions, changes in U.S. and international tax laws, changes in tariffs, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and elevated interest rates. To the extent these macroeconomic conditions continue, we expect that it may adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nResults of Operations\nThe following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenue\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of revenue (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets shown below)\n40.6 \n39.6 \n38.3 \nResearch and development\n11.8 \n10.7 \n10.8 \nSales and marketing\n14.0 \n14.0 \n13.9 \nGeneral and administrative\n15.6 \n15.8 \n16.2 \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n2.3 \n1.8 \n1.8 \nRestructuring charge\n2.4 \n1.5 \n0.4 \nTotal costs and operating expenses\n86.7 \n83.4 \n81.4 \nIncome from operations\n13.4 \n16.6 \n18.6 \nInterest and marketable securities income, net\n2.5 \n1.2 \n0.1 \nInterest expense\n(0.7)\n(0.5)\n(0.3)\nOther expense, net\n(0.5)\n(0.3)\n(0.3)\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n14.7 \n17.0 \n18.1 \nProvision for income taxes\n(2.1)\n(2.8)\n(3.5)\nGain (loss) from equity method investment\n— \n— \n(0.2)\nNet income\n12.7 \n%\n14.2 \n%\n14.4 \n%\nRevenue\nRevenue by solution category during the periods presented was as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n% Change at Constant Currency\n2023\n2022\n% Change\n% Change at Constant Currency\nSecurity\n$\n2,042,661 \n$\n1,765,267 \n15.7 \n%\n16.4 \n%\n$\n1,765,267 \n$\n1,541,941 \n14.5 \n%\n14.7 \n%\nDelivery\n1,318,131 \n1,542,434 \n(14.5)\n(14.0)\n1,542,434 \n1,669,257 \n(7.6)\n(7.1)\nCompute\n630,376 \n504,219 \n25.0 \n25.4 \n504,219 \n405,456 \n24.4 \n24.7 \nTotal revenue\n$\n3,991,168 \n$\n3,811,920 \n4.7 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n$\n3,811,920 \n$\n3,616,654 \n5.4 \n%\n5.8 \n%\nThe increases in our revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023, and 2023 as compared to 2022, was primarily the result of continued growth in sales of our security and compute solutions and the acquisition of Linode in March 2022 which contributed to the growth in our compute solutions. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from our delivery solutions due to impacts from economic and geopolitical uncertainty our customers are facing which resulted in slower traffic growth rates and the continued downward pricing of renewals.\n29\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nThe increase in security solutions revenue for 2024 as compared to 2023, and 2023 as compared to 2022, was due to growth in a number of key products in our security solutions portfolio, including our segmentation and web application solutions, and the growth in certain products that combine elements of our security and delivery offerings to provide robust security solutions.\nThe decrease in delivery solutions revenue for 2024 as compared to 2023, and 2023 as compared to 2022, was due to our customers' economic and geopolitical headwinds which resulted in slower traffic growth rates and the continued downward pricing of renewals. In 2024, these headwinds caused a large social media customer to increase their focus on cost optimization and \"do-it-yourself\" solutions, which additionally reduced traffic on our network and had a negative impact on our delivery revenue.\nThe increase in compute solutions revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023, and 2023 as compared to 2022, was due to growth in sales of compute products, including cloud optimization solutions to new and existing customers and through the acquisition of Linode in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in compute solutions revenue in 2023 as compared to 2022 was also due to a price increase for some of our compute solutions in 2023.\nRevenue derived in the U.S. and internationally during the periods presented is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n% Change at Constant Currency\n2023\n2022\n% Change\n% Change at Constant Currency\nU.S.\n$\n2,075,533 \n$\n1,968,779 \n5.4 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n$\n1,968,779 \n$\n1,902,051 \n3.5 \n%\n3.5 \n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n52.0 \n%\n51.6 \n%\n51.6 \n%\n52.6 \n%\nInternational\n1,915,635 \n1,843,141 \n3.9 \n5.2 \n1,843,141 \n1,714,603 \n7.5 \n%\n8.3 \nAs a percentage of revenue\n48.0 \n%\n48.4 \n%\n48.4 \n%\n47.4 \n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n3,991,168 \n$\n3,811,920 \n4.7 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n$\n3,811,920 \n$\n3,616,654 \n5.4 \n%\n5.8 \n%\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no single country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10% or more of revenue.

(\"GO-NET\"), and MUFG's decision to suspend GO-NET's operations, and impairments of right-of-use-assets for facilities that are no longer needed as a result of our FlexBase program.\n34\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nNon-Operating Income (Expense)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2023\n2022\n% Change\nInterest and marketable securities income, net\n$\n100,280 \n$\n45,194 \n121.9 \n%\n$\n45,194 \n$\n3,258 \n1,287.2 \n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n2.5 \n%\n1.2 \n%\n1.2 \n%\n0.1 \n%\nInterest expense\n$\n(27,117)\n$\n(17,709)\n53.1 \n%\n$\n(17,709)\n$\n(11,096)\n59.6 \n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n(0.7)\n%\n(0.5)\n%\n(0.5)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\nOther expense, net\n$\n(19,561)\n$\n(12,296)\n59.1 \n%\n$\n(12,296)\n$\n(10,433)\n17.9 \n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n(0.5)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\nInterest and marketable securities income, net primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash and marketable securities balances and income and losses on mutual funds that are associated with our employee non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The increase to interest and marketable securities income, net for 2024 as compared to 2023, and 2023 as compared to 2022, was the result of increased cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances received from our August 2023 issuance of $1,265.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2029 and higher interest rates, as well as increased gains associated with the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.\nInterest expense is related to our debt transactions, which are described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The increase to interest expense for 2024 as compared to 2023, and 2023 as compared to 2022, was primarily due to the August 2023 issuance of $1,265.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2029.\nOther expense, net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency as well as other non-operating expense and income items. Other expense, net for 2024 and 2022 also includes impairments of $5.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, from cost method investments. Other expense, net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2023\n2022\n% Change\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n82,095 \n$\n106,373 \n(22.8)\n%\n$\n106,373 \n$\n126,696 \n(16.0)\n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n2.1 \n%\n2.8 \n%\n2.8 \n%\n3.5 \n%\nEffective income tax rate\n14.0 \n%\n16.3 \n%\n16.3 \n%\n19.3 \n%\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2024 as compared to 2023 was mainly due to the benefit from an intercompany sale of intellectual property in 2024, an increase in the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, lower profitability and an increase in the benefit of U.S. federal and state research and development credits. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in foreign income taxed at lower rates, an increase in non-deductible transfer pricing and an increase in certain tax reserves.\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2023 as compared to 2022 was mainly due to a reduction in intercompany sales of intellectual property and the tax on global intangible low-taxed income. These items were partially offset by a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the revaluation of certain foreign income tax liabilities due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits, an intercompany sale of intellectual property, foreign income taxed at lower rates and the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation and non-deductible transfer pricing.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development \n35\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\ncredits. These amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation and the tax on global intangible low-taxed income. Additionally, our effective income tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to an intercompany sale of intellectual property.\nOur effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the settlement of employee equity awards, tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments. Our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and participating OECD member countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate for large multinational enterprise groups, also known as \"Pillar Two\". Many of the participating countries have enacted legislation that became effective beginning in 2024, while other countries continue to work on defining the underlying rules and administrative procedures. Although the enactment and effective legislation in many countries was applicable to us beginning on January 1, 2024, and increased our effective income tax rate, the increase did not have a material impact on our overall results of operations or cash flows. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impacts of the developing legislation. \n(Gain) Loss from Equity Method Investment\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2023\n2022\n% Change\n(Gain) loss from equity method investment\n$\n— \n$\n(1,475)\n100.0 \n%\n$\n(1,475)\n$\n7,635 \n(119.3)\n%\nAs a percentage of revenue\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n0.2 \n%\nThe amounts reflected in (gain) loss from equity method investment relate to our investment with MUFG in a joint venture, GO-NET. GO-NET intended to operate a blockchain-based online payment network. However, GO-NET operations were suspended in February 2022, and ultimately liquidated in August 2023. The gain from equity method investment in 2023 was related to the liquidation and disbursement of our portion of GO-NET's remaining assets, which were previously impaired. The loss from equity method investment in 2022 was the result of our impairment of our investment in GO-NET in the first quarter of 2022 since the operations will no longer generate future cash flows. We do not expect additional activity related to this investment.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP financial measures\"). Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:\n•\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets \n– We have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions we have made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and is unique to each \n36\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nacquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results. \n•\nStock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation\n – Stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, which includes long-term incentive plans to encourage retention, performance-based plans to encourage achievement of specified financial targets and also short-term incentive awards with a one year vest. The grant date fair value of the stock-based compensation awards varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies. \n•\nAcquisition-related costs \n– Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities, as well as certain additional compensation costs payable to employees acquired from the Linode acquisition if employed for a certain period of time. The additional compensation cost was initiated by and determined by the seller and is in addition to normal levels of compensation, including retention programs, offered by Akamai. Acquisition-related costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions, and we exclude acquisition-related costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of operating results to prior periods and to peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions and do not reflect our core operations. \n•\nRestructuring charge\n – We have incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by us or the manner in which that business is conducted. These charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, impairments of long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations (including acquired intangible assets, right-of-use assets, other facility-related property and equipment and internal-use software) and termination fees for any contracts cancelled as part of these programs. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.\n•\nAmortization of debt issuance costs and capitalized interest expense \n– We have convertible senior notes outstanding that mature in 2029, 2027 and 2025. The issuance costs of the convertible senior notes are amortized to interest expense and are excluded from our non-GAAP results because management believes the non-cash amortization expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.\n•\nGains and losses on cost method investments \n– We have recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of cost method investments. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance.\n \n•\nLegal settlements \n– We have incurred losses related to the settlement of legal matters. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations.\n•\nGains and losses from equity method investment\n – We record income or losses on our share of earnings and losses from our equity method investment, and any gains from returns of investments or impairments. We exclude such income and losses because we do not have direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of our core business operations. \n•\nIncome tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items\n – The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as the impact of intercompany sales of intellectual property related to our acquisitions), if any. We believe that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations.\n37\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nThe following table reconciles GAAP income from operations to non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP operating margin for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome from operations\n$\n533,411 \n$\n637,338 \n$\n676,274 \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n92,081 \n66,751 \n64,983 \nStock-based compensation\n393,378 \n328,467 \n217,185 \nAmortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense\n42,910 \n32,981 \n31,768 \nRestructuring charge\n95,441 \n56,643 \n13,529 \nAcquisition-related costs\n7,502 \n13,345 \n29,049 \nLegal settlements\n2,500 \n— \n— \nNon-GAAP income from operations\n$\n1,167,223 \n$\n1,135,525 \n$\n1,032,788 \nGAAP operating margin\n13.4 \n%\n16.7 \n%\n18.7 \n%\nNon-GAAP operating margin\n29.2 \n%\n29.8 \n%\n28.6 \n%\nThe following table reconciles GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n504,918 \n$\n547,629 \n$\n523,672 \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n92,081 \n66,751 \n64,983 \nStock-based compensation\n393,378 \n328,467 \n217,185 \nAmortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense\n42,910 \n32,981 \n31,768 \nRestructuring charge\n95,441 \n56,643 \n13,529 \nAcquisition-related costs\n7,502 \n13,345 \n29,049 \nLegal settlements\n2,500 \n— \n— \nAmortization of debt issuance costs\n6,521 \n5,341 \n4,395 \nLoss (gain) on cost method investments\n5,066 \n(311)\n8,260 \n(Gain) loss from equity method investment\n— \n(1,475)\n7,635 \nIncome tax effect of above non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items\n(154,735)\n(89,364)\n(42,768)\nNon-GAAP net income\n$\n995,582 \n$\n960,007 \n$\n857,708 \n38\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nThe following table reconciles GAAP net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except per share data):\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nGAAP net income per diluted share\n$\n3.27 \n$\n3.52 \n$\n3.26 \nAdjustments to net income:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n0.60 \n0.43 \n0.40 \nStock-based compensation\n2.55 \n2.11 \n1.35 \nAmortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense\n0.28 \n0.21 \n0.20 \nRestructuring charge\n0.62 \n0.36 \n0.08 \nAcquisition-related costs\n0.05 \n0.09 \n0.18 \nLegal settlements\n0.02 \n— \n— \nAmortization of debt issuance costs\n0.04 \n0.03 \n0.03 \nLoss (gain) on cost method investments\n0.03 \n— \n0.05 \n(Gain) loss from equity method investment\n— \n(0.01)\n0.05 \nIncome tax effect of above non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items\n(1.00)\n(0.58)\n(0.27)\nAdjustment for shares\n (1)\n0.03 \n0.02 \n0.02 \nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share\n (2)\n$\n6.48 \n$\n6.20 \n$\n5.37 \nShares used in GAAP per diluted share calculations\n154,346 \n155,397 \n160,467 \nImpact of benefit from note hedge transactions\n (1)\n(744)\n(574)\n(720)\nShares used in non-GAAP per diluted share calculations\n (1)\n153,602 \n154,823 \n159,747 \n(1) Shares used in non-GAAP per diluted share calculations have been adjusted for the periods presented for the benefit of our note hedge transactions. During these periods, our average stock price was in excess of $95.10, which is the initial conversion price of our convertible senior notes due in 2025. See further definition below.\n(2) Amounts may not foot due to rounding.\nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of $1,265 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 and the issuances of $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 and 2025, respectively. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance. With respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2029, 2027 and 2025, unless our weighted average stock price is greater than $126.31, $116.18 and $95.10, respectively, the initial conversion prices, there will be no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nWe consider Adjusted EBITDA to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income excluding the following items: interest and marketable securities income and losses; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; legal settlements; foreign exchange gains and losses; interest expense; amortization of capitalized interest expense; gains and losses on cost method investments; gains and losses from equity method investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue.\n39\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nThe following table reconciles GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n504,918 \n$\n547,629 \n$\n523,672 \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n92,081 \n66,751 \n64,983 \nStock-based compensation\n393,378 \n328,467 \n217,185 \nAmortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense\n42,910 \n32,981 \n31,768 \nRestructuring charge\n95,441 \n56,643 \n13,529 \nAcquisition-related costs\n7,502 \n13,345 \n29,049 \nLegal settlements\n2,500 \n— \n— \nInterest and marketable securities income, net\n(100,280)\n(45,194)\n(3,258)\nInterest expense\n27,117 \n17,709 \n11,096 \nProvision for income taxes\n82,095 \n106,373 \n126,696 \nDepreciation and amortization\n514,455 \n472,035 \n496,909 \nLoss (gain) on cost method investments\n5,066 \n(311)\n8,260 \n(Gain) loss from equity method investment\n— \n(1,475)\n7,635 \nOther expense, net\n14,495 \n12,607 \n2,173 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,681,678 \n$\n1,607,560 \n$\n1,529,697 \nNet income margin\n12.7 \n%\n14.4 \n%\n14.5 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n42.1 \n%\n42.2 \n%\n42.3 \n%\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nRevenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results. Consequently, our financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our international subsidiaries weaken, generally our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted.\nBecause exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. The percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. As of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which are detailed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, totaled $1.9 billion. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high-quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy is designed to limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times.\nChanges in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as accounts receivable, deferred revenue, accounts payable, various accrued expenses and operating lease obligations, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repayments and issuances, purchases and sales of marketable securities, cash paid for acquisitions and similar events. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial stability and flexibility to \n40\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nenable us to continue to make investments at opportune times. We expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $300.3 million held in accounts outside the U.S. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act establishes a territorial tax system in the U.S., which provides companies with the potential ability to repatriate earnings with minimal U.S. federal income tax impact. As a result, our liquidity is not expected to be materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the U.S.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n504,918 \n$\n547,629 \n$\n523,672 \nNon-cash reconciling items included in net income\n1,048,595 \n931,507 \n756,321 \nChanges in operating assets and liabilities\n(34,342)\n(130,697)\n(5,317)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,519,171 \n$\n1,348,439 \n$\n1,274,676 \nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2024 as compared to 2023 was due to increased collections from customers as a result of increased revenue and timing of customer collections. The increase was also due to the shift in our performance-based compensation program from cash-based to stock-based, which led to cash performance-based program payments in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to increased profitability in 2023, as well as cash paid for income taxes related to an intercompany sale of intellectual property and additional compensation costs paid to employees acquired from the Linode acquisition, both of which occurred in 2022 and did not re-occur in 2023.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n$\n(434,066)\n$\n(106,171)\n$\n(872,091)\nCash paid for asset acquisitions\n(132,835)\n(120,985)\n— \nPurchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs\n(685,267)\n(730,040)\n(458,302)\nNet marketable securities activity\n449,516 \n(884,973)\n714,205 \nOther, net\n3,973 \n(6,069)\n(6,122)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(798,679)\n$\n(1,848,238)\n$\n(622,310)\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2024 as compared to 2023 was due to an increase in cash proceeds from net marketable securities activity to fund the acquisition of Noname Security in 2024 and a reduction of purchases of property and equipment related to our compute platform build-out. Additionally, cash used in investing activities in 2023 included an increase in purchases of marketable securities with the proceeds from our August 2023 issuance of convertible senior notes. These decreases were partially offset by cash paid for the acquisition of Noname Security.\nThe increase in cash used in investing activities in 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities with the proceeds from our August 2023 issuance of convertible senior notes and purchases of property and equipment related to our compute platform build-out. These increases were partially offset by cash paid for the acquisition of Linode in March 2022 and by net marketable securities activity as we sold marketable securities during 2022 to fund the acquisition.\n41\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nCash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet convertible senior notes activity\n$\n— \n$\n1,101,028 \n$\n— \nActivity related to stock-based compensation\n(111,663)\n(3,243)\n(25,774)\nRepurchases of common stock\n(557,468)\n(654,046)\n(608,010)\nOther, net\n(10,504)\n(360)\n(393)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n$\n(679,635)\n$\n443,379 \n$\n(634,177)\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities in 2024 as compared to 2023 was due to the net proceeds received in 2023 from our convertible senior notes due 2029 that did not recur in 2024 and increased employee taxes paid in 2024 related to vesting of stock awards driven by the shift in our performance-based compensation program from cash-based to stock-based and an increase in stock price. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in repurchases of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program.\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities in 2023 as compared to 2022 was due to the net proceeds from our convertible senior notes due 2029 that were issued in August 2023. This increase was partially offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock.\nIn October 2021, our board of directors authorized a $1.8 billion share repurchase program that was effective from January 2022 through December 2024. In May 2024, our board of directors authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program, effective May 2024 through June 2027, which was in addition to amounts remaining under the January 2022 program. As of December 31, 2024, the January 2022 $1.8 billion program was fully utilized and $2.0 billion remains available for repurchase on the May 2024 program. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 5.6 million, 7.8 million and 6.4 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $99.14, $83.83 and $94.96, respectively. Our goals for the share repurchase programs are to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs over time and provide the flexibility to return capital to stockholders as business and market conditions warrant, while still preserving our ability to pursue other strategic opportunities. The timing and amount of any future share repurchases will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $3,565.0 million of convertible senior notes outstanding that are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes mature between May 2025 and February 2029. The terms of the notes and hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. \nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn November 2022, we entered into a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit agreement (\"2022 Credit Agreement\"). The 2022 Credit Agreement allows us to borrow up to $500.0 million at various interest rates and contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. \nThere were no outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024. The terms of the revolving credit agreements are discussed more fully in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. \nIn January 2025, we entered into a $150.0 million uncommitted revolving credit agreement (\"2025 Credit Agreement\"). The 2025 Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Any borrowings are secured by collateral consisting primarily of available-for-sale debt securities in our investment portfolio.\n42\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into operating leases for real estate assets related to office space and co-location assets related to space or racks at co-location facilities and related equipment for our servers and other networking equipment. As of December 31, 2024 the total obligation under these agreements was $1,231.6 million, of which $263.1 million is payable in the next 12 months. We have also executed additional operating leases that will commence in 2025 for $197.0 million. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into an operating lease with a data center operator for space in the Virginia area that is expected to commence beginning in the third quarter of 2025. The lease is for a datacenter with gross payments of approximately $750.0 million over a 12 year lease term. We have contemporaneously entered into a sublease with the affiliate of a large social media customer for the use of the space on substantially similar terms. The operating lease costs and associated sublease income will be recorded as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income and are expected to substantially offset each other. The operating lease terms and maturities are discussed more fully in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nPurchase Commitments \nWe enter into long-term agreements with network and internet service providers for bandwidth, as well as execute purchase orders for the purchase of goods or services in the ordinary course of business, which may contain minimum commitments. These minimum commitments may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our vendors, and on our plans for network expansion, including our expansion plans related to our compute business.\nLiquidity Outlook\nBased on our present business plan, we expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures, investments in information technology, potential strategic acquisitions, anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments, settlements of other liabilities and repayment of our $1,150.0 million convertible senior notes due May 2025.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, stockholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. The fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2024 and 2023 was determined to be immaterial.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements. \nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOverview\nOur MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n43\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nDefinitions\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes.\nReview of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. Determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management. Advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct; rather, they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation. Different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.\nDetermination of the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation in a contract also requires the exercise of judgment by management. SSP is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately, or the discounted list price per management’s approved price list. In cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available, a cost-plus-margin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine SSP. Changes to SSP could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations, which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.\nFrom time to time, we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. Consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price. If the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service, revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered. Different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized.\nWe may also resell licenses or services of third parties. If we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services, the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled, after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation. Different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized.\nAccounts Receivable and Related Reserves\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record allowances against our accounts receivable balance, primarily for current expected credit losses. Increases and decreases in the allowance for current expected credit losses are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nEstimates are used in determining our allowance for current expected credit losses using historical loss rates for the previous twelve months as well as expectations about the future where we have been able to develop forecasts to supports our estimates. In addition, the allowance for current expected credit losses considers outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. We assess collectability based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for services previously provided. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in the creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments. \n44\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities\nWe measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability.\nMarketable securities, which consist primarily of securities available-for-sale, are evaluated for impairment when the fair value declines below the cost basis. We periodically evaluate whether the decline is due to credit losses by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the extent to which, the fair value is less than the cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for, the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors. Additionally, we consider our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. If a portion of the unrealized loss is due to credit losses or we do not have the intent or ability to retain our investment in the security, an impairment will be recorded in interest and marketable securities income, net. Impairments, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. We have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date.\n    \nAcquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, non-compete agreements and acquired license rights. We engage third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. Fair value and amortization period determinations may be based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows, royalty cost savings and appropriate discount rates used in calculating present values. The value of our acquired intangible assets could be different if we had used different assumption. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\n    Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized.\n45\nTable \nof\n Content\ns\nWe currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of NOL carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections.\nWe have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated.\nUncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on technical merit, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe issue stock awards as part of our compensation program which includes stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan. For equity classified awards, we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. For liability classified awards, the fair value is determined each reporting period beginning at the grant date until final vesting. We have selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. Our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. Changes to the assumptions may have an impact on the fair value of stock awards, which could have an impact on our financial statements. Judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to be forfeited. Should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. Changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have an impact on our stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects, as well as interest expense related to our outstanding debt. Capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. We periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.",
