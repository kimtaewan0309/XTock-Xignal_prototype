MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources.  The MD&A is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition.  This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations.  The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:\n•\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements;\n•\nOverview;\n•\nResults of Operations;\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources; and\n•\nCritical Accounting Estimates.\nYou should read this discussion along with the Company’s MD&A and audited financial statements and Notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, included within the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the unaudited financial statements and related Notes as of and for th\ne three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025 in\ncluded in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Report”).\nINFORMATION RELATING TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements included or incorporated by reference in this Report, in other documents we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in our press releases, webcasts, conference calls, materials delivered to shareholders and other communications, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.  All statements other than historical factual information are forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenue, expenses, profit, profit margins, asset values, pricing, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, our liquidity position or other projected financial measures; management’s plans and strategies for future operations, including statements relating to anticipated operating performance, customer demand, cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions and the integration thereof, divestitures, spin-offs, split-offs, initial public offerings, other securities offerings or other distributions, strategic opportunities, stock repurchases, dividends and executive compensation; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into, including the impact of changes to global trade policies, restrictions on imports, related countermeasures and reciprocal tariffs; future new or modified laws, regulations, accounting pronouncements or public policy changes; regulatory approvals and the timing and conditionality thereof; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; results of operations and/or financial condition; general economic and capital markets conditions; the anticipated timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other statements that address events or developments that Veralto intends or believes will or may occur in the future.  Terminology such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “continue,” “should,” “could,” “intend,” “will,” “plan,” “aim,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “can,” “may,” “possible,” “potential,” “upcoming,” “forecast” and “positioned” and similar references to future periods are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words.  Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate.  These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties set forth below and under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent updates in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” within Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from the results, developments and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements.  Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements speak \n22\nTable of Contents\nonly as of the date of the report, document, press release, webcast, call, materials or other communication in which they are made.  Except to the extent required by applicable law, we do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise.\nBelow is a summary of material risks and uncertainties we face, some of which we have experienced and any of which may occur in the future.  These risks are discussed more fully in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent updates in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” within Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q:\nBusiness and Strategic Risks\n•\nConditions in the global economy, including military conflicts and changes in trade and tariff policies, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets can adversely affect our business and financial statements. \n•\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share.  Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.\n•\nOur growth depends on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.  \n•\nNon-U.S. economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors can negatively affect our business and financial statements.\n•\nOur growth can also suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Investment Risks\n•\nAny inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our business.  Our acquisition of businesses, investments, or other strategic relationships could also negatively impact our business and financial statements and our indemnification rights may not fully protect us from liabilities related thereto. \n•\nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and financial statements.\nOperational Risks\n•\nSignificant disruptions in, or breaches in security of, our information technology (“IT”) systems or data or violations of data privacy laws can adversely affect our business and financial statements. \n•\nDefects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n•\nIf we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.\n•\nClimate change and sustainability matters, legal or regulatory measures to address climate change and sustainability matters, and any inability on our part to address related stakeholder expectations may negatively affect us.\n•\nOur financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of the supplies that we use in, and the labor we need for, our operations.\n•\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets.\n•\nOur restructuring actions can have long-term adverse effects on our business and financial statements.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual Property Risks\n•\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.  These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the United States.\n•\nThird parties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\nFinancial and Tax Risks\n•\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n•\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.  \n•\nForeign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements.  \n•\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our earnings.  In addition, challenges to tax positions taken through audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\n•\nChanges in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.\nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational Risks\n•\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n•\nWe are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n•\nOur operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n•\nCertain provisions in Veralto’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of Veralto, which could decrease the trading price of Veralto’s common stock.\n•\nThe forum selection provisions under Veralto’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation could discourage lawsuits against Veralto and Veralto’s directors, officers, employees and stockholders.\n•\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nSeparation and Our Relationship with Danaher Risks\n•\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, Veralto may not enjoy the same benefits that Veralto did as a part of Danaher.\n•\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Danaher pursuant to the separation agreement could materially and adversely affect Veralto’s business and financial statements.\n•\nIn connection with Veralto’s separation from Danaher, Danaher will indemnify Veralto for certain liabilities.  However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure Veralto against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Danaher’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\n•\nIf there is a determination that the separation and/or the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Danaher and its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could also incur significant liabilities.\n24\nTable of Contents\n•\nVeralto may be affected by significant restrictions, including on its ability to engage in certain corporate transactions for a two-year period after the distribution in order to avoid triggering significant tax-related liabilities.\n•\nCertain of Veralto’s executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interest in Danaher.  Also, certain of Danaher’s current directors and a former Danaher officer and former Danaher employee are part of Veralto’s Board, which may create conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest.\n•\nDanaher may compete with Veralto.\n•\nVeralto or Danaher may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation or Veralto may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent updates in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” within Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding reasons that actual results may differ materially from the results, developments and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the report, document, press release, webcast, call, materials or other communication in which they are made.  Except to the extent required by applicable law, we do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise.\nOVERVIEW\nBusiness Overview\nVeralto Corporation’s unifying purpose is\n Safeguarding the World’s Most Vital Resources\nTM\n.  Our diverse group of leading operating companies provide essential technology solutions that monitor, enhance and protect key resources around the globe.  We are committed to the advancement of public health and safety and believe we are positioned to support our customers as they address large global challenges including environmental resource sustainability, water scarcity, management of severe weather events, food and pharmaceutical security, and the impact of an aging workforce.  For decades, we have used our scientific expertise and innovative technologies to address complex challenges our customers face across regulated industries – including municipal utilities, food and beverage, pharmaceutical and industrials – where the consequence of failure is high.  Through our core offerings in water analytics, water treatment, marking and coding, and packaging and color, customers look to our solutions to help ensure the safety, quality, efficiency and reliability of their products, processes and people globally.  Veralto is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts with a workforce of nearly 17,000 employees (whom we refer to as “associates”) as of December 31, 2024, strategically located in approximately 50 countries. \nVeralto Corporation is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2023 in connection with the separation of Veralto from Danaher Corporation (“Danaher” or “Former Parent”) on September 30, 2023 as an independent, publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “Separation”).  At the time of the Separation, Veralto Corporation consisted of Danaher’s former Environmental & Applied Solutions segment.  The Separation was effectuated through a pro-rata dividend distribution on September 30, 2023 of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Veralto common stock held by Danaher as of September 13, 2023.  Each Danaher stockholder of record as of the close of business on September 13, 2023 received one share of Veralto common stock for every three shares of Danaher common stock held on the record date.\nVeralto operates through two segments – Water Quality (“WQ”) and Product Quality & Innovation (“PQI”).  Our businesses within these segments have strong globally recognized brands as a result of our leadership in served markets over several decades.  Our WQ segment provides innovative products and services that improve the quality and reliability of water with leading brands including Hach, Trojan Technologies and ChemTreat.  Our PQI segment enables our customers to promote consumer trust in their products and help enable product innovation with leading brands including Videojet, Linx, Esko, X-Rite and Pantone.  We believe our leading positions result from the strength of our commercial organizations, our legacy of innovation, and our close and long-term connectivity to our customers and knowledge of their workflows, underpinned by our culture of continuous improvement.  This has resulted in a large installed base of instruments that drive ongoing consumables and software sales to support our customers.  As a result, our business generates recurring sales which represented approximately 62% of total sales \nduring the \nnine months ended\n October 3, 2025.  Our\n business model also supports a strong margin profile with limited capital expenditure requirements and has generated attractive cash flows.  We believe these attributes allow us to deliver financial performance that is resilient across economic cycles.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of our geographic and industry diversity, Veralto faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development in most of our served markets, the expansion and evolution of high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of our competitors and increasing regulation.  Veralto operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate investments and strategic partnerships, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment and expand our business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments.  We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in our served markets and to globalize our manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources to be responsive to our customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of our operations.  We define high-growth markets as developing markets of the world which include Asia (with the exception of Japan, Australia and New Zealand), Latin America (including Mexico), the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa.  We define developed markets as all markets of the world that are not high-growth markets.\nWe also believe that the Veralto Enterprise System (“VES”) provides us with a strong foundation for competitive differentiation.  VES is \na business management system that consists of a philosophy, processes and tools that \nguide what Veralto does and measure how well Veralto executes, grounded in a culture of continuous improvement\n.\n  VES processes and tools are organized around the areas of Operational Excellence, Growth and Leadership, and are rooted in foundational tools known as the VES Fundamentals, which are relevant to every associate and business function.  The VES Fundamentals are focused on core competencies such as using visual representations of processes to identify inefficiencies, creating standard work, defining and solving problems in a structured way, and continuously improving processes to drive long term impact.\nVeralto uses VES tools to improve our profitability and cash flows, which support our ability to expand our addressable market and improve our market position through investments in areas such as our commercial organization and research and development (“R&D”), including software and digital solutions.  Our cash flows also support acquisitions to enhance our product capabilities and expansion into new and attractive markets, which we have successfully done through the acquisition of over 80 businesses over more than two decades.  \nBusiness Performance \nDuring the three-month period ended October 3, 2025, overall revenues increased 6.9% and core sales increased 5.1% compared to the comparable period in 2024 with growth in both segments.  Currency exchange rates and acquisitions, net of divestitures increased reported sales by 1.5% and 0.3%, respectively, during the three-month period ended October 3, 2025 compared to the comparable period in 2024.  For the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025, overall revenues increased 6.7% and core sales increased 5.9%, compared to the comparable period in 2024.  Currency exchange rates and acquisitions, net of divestitures increased reported sales by 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively during the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025 compared to the comparable period in 2024.  For the definition of “core sales” refer to “—Results of Operations” below. \nGeographically, the Company’s sales during the three-month period ended October 3, 2025 in developed markets increased year-over-year by 7.8%, driven by increased sales of 7.8% in North America and 8.4% in Western Europe.  Sales in high-growth markets increased 4.4% year-over-year.  For the same period, core sales in developed markets increased 5.5% driven by increased core sales of 6.9% in North America and 2.5% in Western Europe.  Core sales in high-growth markets increased 4.3% driven by mid-single digit increases in Latin America. \nGeographically, the Company’s sales during the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025 in developed markets increased year-over-year by 7.7%, driven by increased sales of 7.6% in North America, 8.4% in Western Europe, and 2.4% in other developed markets.  Sales in high-growth markets increased 4.3% year-over-year.  For the same period, core sales in developed markets increased 6.3% driven by increased core sales of 6.8% in North America and 5.6% in Western Europe.  Core sales in high-growth markets increased 5.2% driven by high-single digit increases in Latin America.\nThe Company’s net earnings for the three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025 totaled $239 million and $686 million, respectively, compared to $219 million and $606 million, respectively, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2024.  The increase in net earnings during the three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025 as compared to the three and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2024 was primarily driven by increased sales, resulting from higher volumes and positive pricing actions, partially offset by higher cost of \n26\nTable of Contents\nsales.  Refer to “—Results of Operations” for further discussion of the year-over-year changes in net earnings for the three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025.\nOutlook\nLooking out over the balance of 2025, in our Water Quality segment, we continue to expect positive secular growth drivers across municipal and industrial markets, particularly in North America.  In our Product Quality & Innovation segment, we expect to see steady demand in the consumer-packaged goods markets as the year progresses.\nAcross both segments, the Company continuously assesses the potential effects of tariffs and prospective changes in trade policies. The Company’s objective is to implement appropriate countermeasures designed to mitigate the impact of these items, and other forms of macroeconomic volatility. Regardless of market conditions, the Company utilizes VES to promote growth and ongoing improvement.\nThe Company’s outlook for 2025 reflects its current assessment of the global macro-economic environment, trends in consumer-packaged goods demand, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including enacted tariffs and the Company’s actions to mitigate adverse financial impacts.  The Company’s ability to meet its expectations are subject to numerous risks, including, but not limited to, those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” within the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent updates in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” within Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn this Report, references to the non-GAAP measure of core sales refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to GAAP but excluding sales from acquired (or divested) businesses (as defined below, as applicable) and the impact of currency translation.\nReferences to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations.  The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired/divested businesses (as defined above, as applicable)) and the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired/divested businesses (as defined above, as applicable)) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.\nCore sales growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales growth, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of core sales growth provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in the Company’s business and facilitating comparisons of the Company’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to the Company’s peers.  Management also uses core sales growth to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance and as one of the performance measures in the Company’s short-term incentive compensation program.  The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from core sales because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers, and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n27\nTable of Contents\nSales Growth and Core Sales Growth\n% Change Three-Month Period Ended October 3, 2025 vs. Comparable 2024 Period\n% Change Nine-Month Period Ended October 3, 2025 vs. Comparable 2024 Period\nTotal sales growth (GAAP)\n6.9 \n%\n6.7 \n%\nImpact of:\nAcquisitions/divestitures\n(0.3)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\nCurrency exchange rates \n(1.5)\n%\n(0.5)\n%\nCore sales growth (non-GAAP)\n5.1 \n%\n5.9 \n%\n2025 Sales Compared to 2024\nTotal sales increased 6.9% and 6.7% during the three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025, respectively, compared to the comparable periods in 2024, primarily as a result of core sales growth driven by the factors discussed below by segment.  \nCurrency exchange rates and acquisitions, net of divestitures increased reported sales by 1.5% and 0.3%, respectively, during the three-month period ended October 3, 2025, compared to the comparable period in 2024.  Currency exchange rates and acquisitions, net of divestitures increased reported sales by 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively, during the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025, compared to the comparable period in 2024.  Price increases contributed 2.4% and 1.8% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during the three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025, respectively, and are reflected as a component of core sales growth above.\nBusiness Segments\nSales by business segment for each of the periods indicated were as follows:\nThree-Month Period Ended\nNine-Month Period Ended\n($ in millions)\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nWater Quality\n$\n856 \n$\n801 \n$\n2,475 \n$\n2,327 \nProduct Quality & Innovation\n548 \n513 \n1,632 \n1,521 \nTotal\n$\n1,404 \n$\n1,314 \n$\n4,107 \n$\n3,848 \nFor information regarding the Company’s sales by geographical region, refer to Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit\nThree-Month Period Ended\nNine-Month Period Ended\n($ in millions)\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSales\n$\n1,404 \n$\n1,314 \n$\n4,107 \n$\n3,848 \nCost of sales\n(560)\n(531)\n(1,636)\n(1,544)\nGross profit\n$\n844 \n$\n783 \n$\n2,471 \n$\n2,304 \nGross profit margin\n60.1 \n%\n59.6 \n%\n60.2 \n%\n59.9 \n%\nCost of sales increased by $29 million or 5.5% and by $92 million or 6.0% on a year-over-year basis during the three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in 2024, driven primarily by higher year-over-year sales volumes.\nGross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis during the three-month period ended October 3, 2025 as compared to the comparable period in 2024, due primarily to positive pricing actions and higher volume, and the net positive impact from the gross profit margin of recent acquisitions.  Gross profit margins increased 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis during the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025, as compared to the comparable period in 2024, driven by positive pricing actions and higher volume, and the net positive impact from the gross profit margin of recent acquisitions.  The gross profit margin increase was partially offset by incremental year-over-year labor costs and the impact of product mix.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nThree-Month Period Ended\nNine-Month Period Ended\n($ in millions)\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nSales\n$\n1,404 \n$\n1,314 \n$\n4,107 \n$\n3,848 \nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses\n(451)\n(412)\n(1,312)\n(1,220)\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses\n(67)\n(63)\n(198)\n(184)\nSG&A as a % of sales\n32.1 \n%\n31.4 \n%\n31.9 \n%\n31.7 \n%\nR&D as a % of sales\n4.8 \n%\n4.8 \n%\n4.8 \n%\n4.8 \n%\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 70 basis points and by 20 basis points during the three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in 2024, driven by an increase in the Company’s SG&A expenses exceeding the increase in the Company’s sales.

Net periodic benefit costs during both periods are related to non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans, which includes the assumed rate of return on plan assets, partially offset by amortization of actuarial losses and interest. \nINTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING \nFor a discussion of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, refer to N\note 8 to the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.  \n32\nTable of Contents\nNet interest expense of $21 million and $76 million was recorded\n for the \nthree and nine-month periods\n ended October 3, 2025, respectively, compared to net interest expense \nof $27 million and $85 million for the three and nine-month periods ended \nSeptember 27, 2024, respectively, arising from our outstanding indebtedness, which was incurred in September 2023, partially offset by interest income from larger average cash balances in 2025.  \nINCOME TAXES\nGeneral\nIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.  The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur. \nThe Company’s effective tax rate can be impacted by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, and changes in tax laws and regulations, and legislative policy changes.  For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. \nThe following table summarizes the Company’s effective tax rate: \nThree-Month Period Ended\nNine-Month Period Ended\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nEffective tax rate\n21.9 \n%\n23.4 \n%\n22.0 \n%\n24.8 \n%\nYear-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate\nThe Company operates globally, including in certain jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates than the U.S.  Therefore, based on earnings mix, the impact of operating in such jurisdictions contributes to a higher effective tax rate compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. \nThe effective tax rate for the three-month period ended October 3, 2025 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally due to the geographic mix of earnings described above and a net discrete provision of $1 million related primarily to the impact of uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the impact of a German tax rate change on deferred taxes.  The net discrete provision increased the effective tax rate by 0.3% for the three-month period ended October 3, 2025.\nThe effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally due to the geographic mix of earnings described above, the unfavorable impact of a non-deductible loss on the sale of a product line of $2 million, and a net discrete benefit of $1 million related primarily to the impact of a German tax rate change on deferred taxes, partially offset by the impact of uncertain tax positions.  The net discrete benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 0.1% for the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025.\nThe effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally due to the geographic mix of earnings described above, net discrete expense of $1 million related primarily to the impact of uncertain tax positions, partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.  The net discrete expense increased the effective tax rate by 0.3% for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024.\nThe effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 27, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally due to the geographic mix of earnings described above, the unfavorable impact of a non-deductible loss on the sale of a product line of $3 million, and a net discrete expense of $5 million related primarily to the impact of uncertain tax positions, partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.  The net discrete expense increased the effective tax rate by 1.0% for the nine-month period ended September 27, 2024.\nOn July 4, 2025, an act to provide for reconciliation to title II of H. Con. Res. 14 (known commonly as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”)) was enacted into law.  The OBBBA includes eliminating the requirement to capitalize U.S. R&D, permanent extension of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 and other corporate tax \n33\nTable of Contents\nimpacts.  The Company has considered the impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements and concluded it is immaterial.  \nThe Company conducts business globally, and the Former Parent filed numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. jurisdictions.  The non-U.S. countries in which the Company has a significant presence include Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  Excluding these non-U.S. jurisdictions, the Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual non-U.S. country would not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s income. \nThe Company is routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities.  In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into certain agreements with Danaher, including a tax matters agreement.  The tax matters agreement distinguishes between the treatment of tax matters for “Joint” filings compared to “Separate” filings prior to the Separation.  “Joint” filings involve legal entities, such as those in the United States, that include operations from both Danaher and the Company.  By contrast, “Separate” filings involve certain entities (primarily outside of the United States) that exclusively include either Danaher’s or the Company’s operations, respectively.  In accordance with the tax matters agreement, Danaher is liable for and has indemnified the Company against all income tax liabilities involving “Joint” filings for periods prior to the Separation.  The Company remains liable for certain pre-Separation income tax liabilities including those related to the Company’s “Separate” filings.\nPursuant to U.S. tax law, the Company’s initial U.S. federal income tax return was filed during October 2024 for the short taxable year September 30, 2023 through December 31, 2023.  The Company expects to file its first full year U.S. federal income tax return for 2024 with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) during 2025.  The IRS has not initiated an examination of the Company’s tax return filed in 2024.  The Company’s operations in certain U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions remain subject to routine examination.\nThe amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments.  Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis.  Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted, as necessary.  For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nIn 2025, compre\nhensive incom\ne decreased $89 million\n for the three-month period ended October 3, 2025 as compared to the comparable period in 2024\n, primarily driven by losses from foreign currency translation adjustments and to a lesser extent unrealized loss on net investment hedges, partially offset by higher net earnings, during the three-month period ended October 3, 2025.  Comprehensive income increased $203 million for the nine-month period ended \nOctober 3, 2025 as compared to the comparable period in 2024, \nprimarily driven by gains from foreign currency translation adjustments and to a lesser extent net earnings, partially offset by unrealized loss on net investment hedges during the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025\n. \nThe Company recorded foreign currency translation losses of $34 million and unrealized losses on net investment hedges of $6 million for the three-month period ended October 3, 2025, compared to foreign currency translation gains of $88 million, and unrealized losses on net investment hedge of $18 million for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024. The foreign currency translation losses during the three-month period ended October 3, 2025 were driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies in the period. The foreign currency translation gains during the the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 were primarily driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies in the period. The Company recorded foreign currency translation gain of $200 million, and an unrealized loss on net investment hedge of $60 million for the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025, compared to foreign currency translation gains of $23 million, and an unrealized loss on net investment hedge of $6 million for the nine-month period ended September 27, 2024. The foreign currency translation gains during the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025 were driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies in the period. The foreign currency translation gains during the nine-month period ended September 27, 2024 were primarily driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies in the period.  Foreign currency translation adjustments reflect the gain or loss resulting from the impact of the change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s foreign operations as they are translated to the Company’s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.   \n34\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities.  The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue to invest in existing businesses, consummate strategic acquisitions, make interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness, and manage its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.  \nShelf Registration Statement\nOn October 24, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, subscription rights, purchase contracts, units and warrants that may be issued in the future in one or more offerings.  Unless otherwise specified in the corresponding prospectus supplement, the Company expects to use net proceeds realized from future securities issuances off the Shelf Registration Statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and working capital.  \nOverview of Cash Flows and Liquidity\nFollowing is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity:\nNine-Month Period Ended\n($ in millions)\nOctober 3, 2025\nSeptember 27, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n766 \n$\n590 \nPayments for additions to property, plant and equipment\n$\n(43)\n$\n(33)\nAll other investing activities\n(20)\n(7)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(63)\n$\n(40)\nPayment of dividends\n$\n(82)\n$\n(67)\nProceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock-based compensation\n20 \n18 \nAll other financing activities\n(15)\n— \nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(77)\n$\n(49)\n•\nOperating cash flows increased $176 million, or 30%, during the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025 as compared to the comparable period in 2024, primarily driven by higher net income, partially offset by changes in net working capital.\n•\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $23 million for the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025 as compared to the comparable period in 2024, primarily driven by a $13 million increase in cash used in other investing activities and a $10 million increase in capital expenditures.  Other investing activities is comprised of immaterial acquisition and disposition activity.\n•\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $28 million for the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025 as compared to the comparable period in 2024 primarily driven by the payment of dividends. \nDividends\nAggregate cash payments for dividends on Company common stock during the nine-month period ended October 3, 2025 were $82 million. \nI\nn the third quarter of 2025, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share of Company common stock payable on October 31, 2025 to holders of record as of September 30, 2025.  \nCash and Cash Requirements\nA\ns of October 3, 2025, the\n Company held approximately $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were on deposit with financial institutions or invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less.  Of the cash and cash equivalents, appro\nximately \n$767 million\n was held within the United States and \n35\nTable of Contents\napproximately \n$1,008 million\n was held outside of the United States.  The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support general corporate purposes, which may include working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying taxes and any related interest or penalties, funding its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing shares of the Company’s common stock and supporting other business needs.  \nThe Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs (if available) or borrow under the Company’s credit facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs (if available) and/or access the capital markets.  The Company also may from time to time seek to access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.  \nRepatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws.  In\n general, re\npatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no material incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes on such distributions.  The cash that the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions.  However, the Company could make a distribution to the extent it has been previously taxed on such earnings in the United States.  The potential tax implications of repatriating previously taxed earnings are driven by the facts at the time of distribution with the incremental cost to repatriate these earnings not expected to be material.  \nAs of October 3, 2025, managemen\nt believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States. \nContractual Obligations\nFor a description of the Company’s debt and lease obligations, commitments, and litigation and contingencies, refer to Notes 8, 12, 15 and 16 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included within the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates as described in th\ne 2024 Annu\nal Report on Form 10-K."
