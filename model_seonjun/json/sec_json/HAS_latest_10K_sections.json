(“Hasbro”) is a leading game, intellectual property (\"IP\"), and toy company whose mission is to create joy and community through the magic of play. With over 100 years of expertise, we deliver play experiences to kids, families, and fans around the world, through physical and digital games, video games, toys, licensed consumer products, location-based entertainment, film, TV and more.     \nThrough our franchise-first approach, we unlock value from both new and legacy IP, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, MONOPOLY, HASBRO GAMES, NERF, TRANSFORMERS, PLAY-DOH and PEPPA PIG, as well as premier partner brands. Powered by our portfolio of  iconic brands and a diversified network of partners and subsidiary studios, we bring fans together wherever they are, from tabletop to screen.  \nFor more than a decade, Hasbro has been consistently recognized for its corporate citizenship, including being named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL Media, a 2025 JUST Capital Industry Leader, one of the 50 Most Community-Minded Companies in the U.S. by the Civic 50, and a Brand that Matters by Fast Company.\nRecent Developments\nFiscal year 2024 was a year of continued transformation for our business and we began to see tangible results from our initiatives. Specifically, we focused our efforts on strategic investments in our most valuable and profitable franchises across games, licensing, toys and entertainment. We also made significant progress in our cost-savings initiatives, and further strengthened our leadership team with industry veterans and turnaround experts. \n2024 Business Results\nWe finished 2024 with momentum, led by another record year in our Wizards of the Coast and Digital Games segment, continued success in licensing, and operating profit improvement across the Company. \n•\nMAGIC: THE GATHERING had a solid year, nearly matching 2023’s record despite fewer set releases. Modern Horizons 3, Bloomburrow, and Duskmourn led performance in tentpole sets with backlist and Secret Lair demand also exceeding expectations. \n•\nDigital licensing growth was led by Monopoly Go! from our partners at Scopely, Inc., closing the year with a successful TV campaign and the launch of Tycoon Club. We also continued to see sales from Baldur's Gate 3 after its successful release in 2023 by our partners at Larian Studios.  \n•\nFor DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, we celebrated the brand’s 50th Anniversary with the 2024 Players Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide, both top selling products in D&D’s history.\n•\nIn our Consumer Products segment, we saw solid performance from BEYBLADE and TRANSFORMERS led by innovation and the animated film Transformers One with our partners at Paramount. \n•\nLicensing in our Consumer Products segment grew on the back of MY LITTLE PONY trading cards.\n•\nOur toys business had improved profitability behind supply chain productivity and lean inventory management. \nOperational Excellence Program\nIn 2024, we continued to execute on our Operational Excellence program, an ongoing enterprise-wide cost-savings initiative that includes targeted cost-savings, supply chain transformation and certain other restructuring actions designed to drive growth and enhance shareholder value. Since this program was initiated in 2022, we have delivered approximately $600 million of gross cost savings and $320 million of net cost savings.\nBoard and Executive Leadership\nIn March 2024, we brought additional skills and experience to our Board of Directors with the addition of Frank Gibeau, Darin Harris, and Owen Mahoney, each of whom has significant executive and relevant operational leadership expertise. Three longer-tenured directors, Michael Burns, Tracy Leinbach and Linda Zecher Higgins, retired from the Board in May 2024. \nOn July 18, 2024, we announced the appointment of John Hight as the new President of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming. Mr. Hight previously served as Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Warcraft Franchise at Blizzard Entertainment, overseeing all development and commercial activities for World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Warcraft Rumble. \n6\nTable of Contents\nOn July 18, 2024, we also announced the appointment of Holly Barbacovi, a seasoned HR leader, as our new Chief People Officer. Ms. Barbacovi previously served as Wizards of the Coast’s Vice President of Human Resources from 2016 to 2020. She rejoined Hasbro from Bungie, where she most recently served as Chief Operating Officer and prior to that was their Chief People Officer. \nOur Mission and Strategy\nOur mission is to create joy and community through the magic of play, a universal need that lies at the heart of our brands.\nGames, IP, and toys each play an important role in driving our play-focused mission. Toys are often the first handshake we have with consumers, providing an opportunity for consumers at all ages to enjoy our brands. Games offer consumers additional channels to experience our brands, both in traditional format and through digital games. Licensing our intellectual property and strategic partnerships provide further opportunities to extend the reach of our brands across digital games, consumer products categories, entertainment, location-based experiences, and more. We believe our diversified portfolio positions us for continuous and extended reach with consumers and long-term growth. \nWe are Playing to Win.\n In 2025, we launched our refreshed strategy \"Playing to Win\" to refocus the Company on play and partnership. Through play fueled brand engagement and partner scaled co-investment, we plan to expand our consumer reach as a games, IP, and toy company. We have set goals and objectives to be one of the most profitable and diverse toy and game companies globally, powered by multi-segment and multi-generational franchises. To significantly extend our consumer reach and drive for revenue and profit growth, we are focusing on five key strategic building blocks:\n•\nProfitable Franchises:\n Focus on improving the fundamentals of profitable, play-focused brands, through innovation, partnership, operational excellence, managed cost-discipline and retail execution.\n•\nAging Up\n: Expand our consumer base and drive play and collectible experiences for fans of all ages, recognizing that consumers aged 13 and above are gaining purchase share.\n•\nEveryone Plays:\n Engage across the play spectrum to where we under-index and capture new consumers across demographics and markets.\n•\nDigital and Direct:\n Embrace new ways to engage with our consumers through video games, digital technology and direct-to-consumer interactions.\n•\nPartner Scale:\n Capitalize on our partners’ investments and scale to enhance our brands through strategic relationships and licensing arrangements.\nOur Business: Games, IP, and Toys. \nWe operate in three lines of business: games, IP, and toys, each playing a role in driving our play-focused mission.\nGames\nIP – Licensing & Entertainment\nToys\nOur high profit, high growth investment center. As consumers embrace digital, our game portfolio offers new channels to express our brands.\nOur capital-lite, partner scale opportunity. Licensing drives our brands across consumer product categories, screens and experiences.\nOur first handshake with consumers; a cash generative business in a stable category driven by brands, innovation and licenses.\nAs a Company, we possess three competitive advantages: 1) a broad and deep brand portfolio rooted in play; 2) one of the biggest and most diverse licensing businesses in the world and 3) a profitable games business anchored by MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and Hasbro gaming classics. \nOur competitive advantages reinforce one another. Our toy and game brands fuel our licensing business. Our licensing business receives external capital and marketing investments which strengthen our brands and our bottom line. Our games business adds further strength to our balance sheet giving us the investment dollars to upgrade core capabilities like design, supply chain, and marketing and gives us new ways to expand our brands’ reach, particularly in digital.\nOperational Excellence: Transforming Hasbro. \nWe are midway through a turnaround. Over the past two years our transformation initiatives have focused on:\n•\nDivestiture of eOne (as defined below) which returned “play” to the center of our mission and investment priorities, ultimately reducing content spend by over 90%.\n7\nTable of Contents\n•\nReducing complexity across the business, including significantly reducing SKU count, reducing owned inventory levels and reducing the cost structure.\n•\nReinvigorating licensing and expanding into new partnerships across toys, gaming and experiences.\n•\nAccelerating digital initiatives and digitally-orientated partnerships.\n•\nRight-sizing our organizational structure.\nNow we are continuing to transform the business by upgrading our systems and talent with an emphasis on:\n•\nProcess and systems modernization across IT, accounting, finance and HR.\n•\nSupply chain excellence to continue improving predictability, costs and services across the network.\n•\nDesign acceleration to improve the time to market, improve agility and reduce costs.\n•\nAdoption of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and digital solutions to innovate, improve operational efficiency, and go to market digitally.\nOur Brand Portfolio.  \nBelow is a summary of the brands and business models where we compete.\n•\nToys and Games\n. We market and sell toys and games based on our owned and controlled brands globally at retail stores, through ecommerce platforms and through our fan-based direct-to-consumer platforms Hasbro PULSE and SECRET LAIR. Our key brands are:\n•\nMAGIC: THE GATHERING\n•\nHasbro Games\n•\nPLAY-DOH\n•\nTRANSFORMERS\n•\nDUNGEONS & DRAGONS\n•\nPEPPA PIG\n•\nNERF\nAdditionally, through license agreements with third parties, we develop and sell products based on popular third-party brands through these channels. Key partner brands include: \n•\nMARVEL, including SPIDER-MAN and THE AVENGERS\n(1)\n•\nLUCASFILMS' STAR WARS\n(1)\n•\nBEYBLADE\n•\nSECRET LAIR partners such as Final Fantasy, The Lord of the Rings, and Fallout\n \n(\n1) \nOwned by The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”).\nOur products include a wide range of games, trading cards and collectibles, action figures, arts and crafts and creative play products, dolls, play sets, preschool toys, plush products, vehicles and toy-related specialty products, sports action products and accessories and many other consumer products which represent an array of internationally recognizable brands that capture the imagination of our consumers worldwide.\nOur gaming business continues to transform game play with new and innovative games and play experiences. To successfully execute our gaming strategy, we focus on brands that capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach using consumer insights and data analytics, technology advancements and offering game-play experiences addressed to consumer demand for face-to-face, trading card and digital game experiences played as board, off-the-board, digital, card, electronic, trading card and role-playing games.\nOur subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast (“Wizards”), is a critical part of our gaming business, driving innovation and growth through its popular role-playing and fantasy card-collecting games. These games include:\n•\nMAGIC: THE GATHERING, one of the original collectible card games, is a strategic trading card game with compelling characters in multiple universes that continue to expand through new card sets, including with well-known third-party properties such as The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-Earth card set released in 2023. MAGIC: THE GATHERING became Hasbro’s first billion-dollar brand in 2022.\n•\nDUNGEONS & DRAGONS, one of the world’s most popular tabletop role-playing games, is a cooperative, storytelling game where players take on the roles of different characters within a \n8\nTable of Contents\nstory. There are dice and basic rules involved, and often maps and miniatures or tokens, but the tools that come into play most often are the imaginations of the players. An update to the fifth edition of the D&D rule set was published in 2024.\nOur other iconic game brands include long-time favorites such as MONOPOLY, JENGA, CONNECT 4, THE GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CLUE and TRIVIAL PURSUIT, as well as many other well-known game brands and newer games that are geared toward a mature consumer.\n•\nDigital Gaming\n.\n Key to our success is the continued investment in, growth and development of, our digital gaming business, including development of AAA games, games as a service and licensed games. Spanning action role-playing games for web-based play, PC and gaming consoles, to Hasbro branded mobile application-based games, our digital gaming business helps to unlock the full value of our brands and achieve our mission of storytelling and bringing our brands to life. Recent examples include:\n◦\nthe popular Monopoly Go! free-to-play mobile game, released by Scopely, Inc. during 2023 and based on the classic board game, MONOPOLY;\n◦\nthe 2023 release of Baldur's Gate 3, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS-based role-playing video game from our partners at Larian Studios which won several awards, including Game of the Year at the 10th annual Game Awards; and \n◦\nour 2022 acquisition of D&D Beyond, the premier digital content platform for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. \nWe continue to develop and enhance other digital games internally and through third parties. For example, we have developed and launched the digital version of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game, \nMagic: The Gathering Arena \nand its related mobile application, both of which complement the Company's direct-to-customer relationships with our new and long-time MAGIC: THE GATHERING fan-base. Developing and publishing our own games requires a substantial amount of time and investment, and there are risks that the games we develop will not be successful. We believe, however, that our brands and characters together with our studios and partners provide us a competitive edge and this has the potential to be a high growth area for us.\n•\nLicensing IP\n. Hasbro is one of the world’s largest and most diverse licensors, and a growing part of our Playing to Win strategy is to extend the reach of our brands through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for consumer products, digital games and entertainment. \n◦\nConsumer Products Licensing\n:\n  We license our intellectual property for a variety of consumer products, including apparel, publishing, home goods and electronics, or in certain situations, toy products where the out-licensing of brands is more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves. A recent example of this includes the return of our LITTLEST PET SHOP brand through our partnership with Basic Fun!, a global marketer of toys and consumer products. Together we relaunched LITTLEST PET SHOP through a Roblox experience in December 2023, a refreshed LITTLEST PET SHOP product lineup in the first half of 2024 featuring new characters, collectables, and playsets. Another recent example, in 2024, we saw a resurgence from MY LITTLE PONY through licensing across merchandising categories, music, and trading card products. \n◦\nDigital Games Licensing\n: \n We out-license certain of our brands to other third-party digital game developers who transform Hasbro brand-based characters and other intellectual properties into digital gaming experiences such as Monopoly Go! and Baldur's Gate 3 discussed above. \n◦\nLocation-Based Entertainment\n:\n Location-based entertainment (“LBE”) includes licensing our brands to theme parks, water parks, hotels and resorts, family entertainment centers, retail, dining and entertainment, shows, exhibits and exhibitions such as Hasbro City, the recently-opened Hasbro-themed family entertainment center located in Paseo Interlomas, Mexico featuring thrilling theme park rides and experiences, live shows, food and beverage options and the region's first Hasbro-themed retail location. These experiences bring our brands to life and further immerse our consumers in our storytelling in a capital efficient manner. \n•\nEntertainment\n. Reinforcing storylines associated with our owned and controlled brands through entertainment mediums, including television, film, digital content and other programming is our primary entertainment strategy. With our cross-platform capabilities, our entertainment business leverages film and television production and sales, digital content and children's programming to create compelling \n9\nTable of Contents\nentertainment and drive creativity and overall awareness across brands with merchandising and licensing tie-ins. Principal brands include PEPPA PIG and MY LITTLE PONY whose content entertains children worldwide and generates revenues through licensing and merchandising programs across multiple retail categories. Another recent example is \nTransformers One\n, an animated film featuring the untold origin story of Optimus Prime and Megatron released in September 2024 in partnership with Paramount Pictures.  \n•\nHasbro Direct\n. Our Hasbro Direct business adopts a \"Fans Come First\" approach, intended to create direct connections with our consumers. It includes the following platforms:\n◦\nMagic: The Gathering Arena - \nthe free-to-play online adaptation of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game where players can explore the fantasy worlds of \nMagic: The Gathering Arena\n, play a variety of game formats to collect cards and test skills against friends and other players around the world, or enter in-game tournaments.\n◦\nSECRET LAIR - our internet-based storefront where MAGIC: THE GATHERING fans can purchase exclusive and limited versions of cards.\n◦\nD&D Beyond - the premier digital content platform for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS where fans can access online versions of official rule books, character sheets and catalogs, adventures, and other digital tools such as character builders and official D&D content available for purchase.\n◦\nHasbro PULSE - Hasbro's ultimate fan ecommerce destination.\nWith these platforms, we are expanding and enhancing our capabilities beyond traditional ecommerce to serve our consumers and activate brands. Connecting with fans directly makes our products more accessible in more markets and enables us to sell brands and showcase selected items, creating more brand awareness while gaining a deeper understanding of our fans and what they want and expect from Hasbro.\n•\nOther Elements of our Strategy\n. Other aspects of our strategy that help drive our consumer reach and storytelling experiences include digital content. We understand the importance of digital content to drive fan engagement, including in gaming and across other media, and of integrating such content with our products. Digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for traditional products through the use of complementary digital applications, social media and websites which extend storylines and enhance play.\nProduct Development and Royalties\nDevelopment\nOur success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play offerings and requires ongoing development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance. Our products are developed by a global development function, which is responsible for the development, design and engineering of new products and their packaging and the innovation, improvement or modification of ongoing products. Much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers, artists, model makers and engineers. The pace of change in innovation and complexity of our product offerings is expected to continue to evolve as we adopt artificial intelligence in the development new brands and products.\nIn addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff, we work with a number of independent toy and game designers and compete for their designs and ideas with other toy and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when acquired or licensed by us, are usually exclusive for particular categories and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item. These designer royalty agreements may also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees.\nRoyalties and Participations\nWe produce an array of products under licenses based on our partners’ trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies, television shows and other entertainment media. We compete with other toy and game manufacturers for these licensed rights. Licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories, or may be non-exclusive, in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees. In many instances, advance royalties and minimum \n10\nTable of Contents\nguarantees are required by these license agreements. Our royalty expense in any given year may vary depending upon product mix and the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media.\nWe are increasingly promoting our brands through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for a wide range of digital games, consumer products and location-based experiences. Under these agreements, licensees either pay us a sales-based or usage-based royalty, or a combination of both, for use of our brands, and, in some cases, the license arrangements are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees, over the term of the license.\nOur entertainment offerings also require us to pay royalties and participations to those involved in the creation of the content, such as producers, writers, directors and actors.\nMarketing and Sales, Customer Concentration and Advertising\nMarketing and Sales\n \nOur global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs. The global marketing group works with the global development function to deliver unified, brand-specific consumer experiences. In addition to the global marketing function, our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution.\nOur products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers, including mass-market retailers, distributors, wholesalers, discount stores, specialty hobby stores, drug stores, mail order houses, catalog stores, department stores and other traditional retailers, large and small, as well as ecommerce retailers and direct-to-customer through our fan-focused Hasbro Direct business. Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who, for the most part, sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence. The majority of our product sales are to large chain stores, distributors, e-retailers and wholesalers.\nCustomer Concentration\nDuring 2024, net revenues from our top five customers accounted for approximately 36% of our consolidated global net revenues, including our largest customers, Wal-Mart, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. who together represented 23% of consolidated global net revenues, with each accounting for 12% and 11%, respectively. Please see Part I, Item 1A. \nRisk Factors,\n of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of risks relating to customer concentration.\nAdvertising\nWe advertise many of our products and brands through digital marketing, social media and on television. Products are strategically cross-promoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item, but also those complementary products. \nPart of our strategy includes focusing on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several mediums, including digital and tabletop gaming, consumer products, television, film and live action experiences. Our brands obtain marketing and advertising support through entertainment appearing on major networks globally, theatrical releases as well as on various other digital platforms.\nMany of our new products are introduced to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction. Our advertising expenditures are impacted by our product mix in any given year. For example, brands based on major motion picture releases generally require less advertising as a result of the promotional activities around the motion picture release, whereas leading into a major digital gaming launch, our Wizards of the Coast business will have substantial increases to advertising, marketing and promotional expenses to acquire players and promote gaming releases.\nSupply Chain and Manufacturing\nBeginning in late 2022, we launched a multi-year initiative aimed at transforming our global supply chain into a best-in-class network that delivers competitive advantages through performance efficiency, operating model integration and organizational accountability. We are continuing to refine our integrated supply chain from planning and designing to sourcing and delivering, with our multi-year plan to deliver improved capabilities and provide a productivity pipeline to fuel growth at Hasbro.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe majority of our toy and game products are manufactured in third-party facilities principally in the U.S. and the Far East, primarily China, Vietnam, India and Japan. We continually look to diversify our manufacturing footprint.\nMost of our toys and games are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products also use electronic components. All of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price. There are certain chemicals (including phthalates and BPA) that national, state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of; however, we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business. We generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year. However, significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year.\nCompetition\nWe are a worldwide leader in the development, design, sale and marketing of games and toys, operating in a highly competitive business environment. We believe our diversified portfolio together with the strength of our extensive intellectual property portfolio provides us with a competitive advantage and allows us to adapt to changes in the competitive landscape, consumer trends and economic conditions.\nThe play industry is highly competitive. We view our primary competition as coming from game and toy companies, digital gaming companies and digital gaming developers. We compete with several large companies in our product categories, as well as with many smaller United States and international game and toy designers, manufacturers and marketers. In certain instances, we also compete with large retailers, who offer such products under their own private labels, often at lower prices. Competition is based primarily on meeting consumer preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences. To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product pricing. We expect that as artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, we will see increased competition from those using such technology to develop games, toys and content.\nWe also contend with the expanding variety of digital gaming and digital entertainment offerings available for children, while product life cycles of traditional toys and games have shortened. As a result, our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment, we also compete, particularly in meeting the demands of older children, with entertainment offerings of many technology companies, such as makers of tablets, mobile devices, video games and other digital gaming products and screens, and social media companies.\nSeasonality\nOur Wizards and entertainment businesses are subject to variations in sales based on the timing of release of card sets, games, and content releases. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of holiday periods, geographical release dates and competition in the market.\nFor our Consumer Products segment, our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines, supply and product availability, marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers, TV and film content releases, including the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products, and changes in overall economic conditions. As a result, a disproportionate volume of our net revenues from our consumer products business has historically been earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season, including Christmas. \nIn 2024 and 2023, the second half of the year accounted for approxima\ntely 58%\n and 56% of full year revenues, respectively, with the third and fourth quarters accounting for approximately 31% and 27%, respectively, of full year net revenues in 2024 and 30% and 26%, respectively, of full year revenues in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2023.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nThe following discusses our governance and focus areas of our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) efforts.\nGovernance\nESG governance starts with our Board of Directors (\"Board\"), with specific oversight by our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee of the Board (\"Governance Committee\"). ESG topics, such as climate and sustainability, human rights and ethical sourcing, are regular agenda items at Governance Committee meetings. The Governance Committee analyzes these issues and makes recommendations to the full Board. In \n12\nTable of Contents\naddition, the Audit Committee of our Board oversees SEC and public disclosures in specific matters, such as conflict minerals, and enterprise risk. The full Board receives regular updates regarding our ESG progress.\nIn addition to Board-level governance, our CEO and the Executive Leadership Team (\"ELT\") regularly review our ESG performance, progress and opportunities. Our ELT and members of our global corporate sustainability team meet several times a year to ensure management oversight of the Company’s ESG strategy, impact and performance. This group sets the direction for our global ESG strategy and ensures the integration of ESG throughout the organization and supply chain.\nFocus Area: \nClimate and Sustainability\n•\nWe recognize the impact our business can have on the environment and are working to reduce our footprint. We view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and to continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies.\n•\nThe Science-Based Targets Initiative (\"SBTi\") has validated our greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emission reductions targets. \n•\nWe continue our industry-first toy recycling program in partnership with TerraCycle, a leader in product recycling outside of municipal recycling. \n•\nWe continue to work to integrate the climate risk identification and mitigation into our overall enterprise risk management process and into our preparation work for the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\nFocus Area: \nHuman Rights and Ethical Sourcing\n \nOur Human Rights and Ethical Sourcing program launched over 30 years ago and is dedicated to ensuring that facilities involved in the production of our toys, games and licensed consumer products comply with Hasbro’s Global Business Ethics Principles. The program is designed to ensure fair and safe working conditions; fairness, dignity and respect for workers; and robust supplier engagement to ensure strong safety, health and environmental performance. While working on these issues with partners, suppliers, third-party factories and licensees is complex, we remain vigilant in our commitment to ensure workers in our supply chain are treated in accordance with our high ethical standards and applicable laws.\nHuman Capital Management\nOverview\nOur key human capital management objectives for our direct workforce are to attract, develop, motivate and retain a talented workforce to enable us to offer great play experiences to our fans and consumers. The experience and dedication of our employees are at the heart of our success, energizing everything we do, from developing innovative products to creating immersive game, consumer products and entertainment experiences. Our teams are inspired by our purpose of creating joy and community for all people around the world. Our culture sets us up to deliver excellence, build impactful brands and expand our leadership in play, entertainment and beyond. As our organization continues to evolve, we remain steadfast in our ambition to provide a community where everyone can show up authentically as themselves and deliver their best work. The following discusses our governance of human capital management and our key focus areas.\nGovernance\nOur governance of human capital management falls within the governance structure for ESG overall. The Governance Committee of the Board oversees the company’s human capital policies and practices. The Compensation and Talent Committee of the Board oversees our compensation programs as well as talent management, including with respect to recruitment, leadership, career development, succession planning, employee engagement, Company culture and retention.\nOur Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO and is a member of our ELT, is responsible for developing and executing key aspects of our human capital strategy, including the attraction, acquisition, development and engagement of talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy, the design of competitive compensation and employee benefit programs. Our ESG Committee is responsible for developing and executing our global ESG strategy, including our human rights and ethical sourcing programs for the workers across our supply and value chain. \n13\nTable of Contents\nEmployees\nAs of year-end 2024, we employed approximately 4,985 people worldwide, with approximately 54% of our employees in North America (47% in the United States; 7% in Canada), 20% in Europe, 18% in Asia Pacific, and 8% in Latin America (includes Mexico). Approximately 9% of our employees globally are covered by unions or collective bargaining agreements.\nFocus Area: \nInclusion and Belonging\nWe believe that the more inclusive we are as a company, the more effective our employees will be and the stronger our business will perform. We work diligently to foster an inclusive culture that reflects the consumers and communities we serve globally. \nFocus Area: \nCompensation & Well-being of Employees\nEmployee attraction, development, motivation and retention has long been a key Hasbro priority. We recognize and reward our employees with a total rewards package that includes competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits.\nOur compensation program includes base pay, equity compensation (for certain levels), annual incentives, and a robust recognition program. Competitive compensation is the cornerstone of our total rewards program. We regularly review salary ratios for men and women in similar roles to help maintain internal equity and market competitiveness across the globe. We review both industry and local market data at least annually to identify trends and market gaps to maintain the competitiveness of our compensation program.\n \nWhen designing our compensation and employee benefit programs, we consider the big picture of how these programs contribute to the overall employee experience.\nOur comprehensive benefit program includes robust core benefits, voluntary benefits, product discounts and a well-being program that help people integrate work and life commitments. We evaluate the benefit program annually to ensure our offer continues to meet the needs of our employees, remains competitive in the marketplace and continues to reflect the company values.\nFocus Area: \nTalent Development and Performance Management\n \nWe are committed to the continued development of our people. Strategic talent assessments and succession planning occur on a planned cadence biannually – globally and across all business areas. The CEO and Chief People Officer convene meetings with senior company leadership and the Board to review the full talent pipeline with a focus on our top company talent. We provide opportunities for our employees to grow their careers through annual goal setting, development plans and quarterly conversations. We invest in developing our employees by providing blended learning opportunities and in-house trainings and by offering third-party programs, including specialized trainings and broader academic pursuits.\nFocus Area: \nPhilanthropy and Social Impact\n \nGiving back to our local and global communities is core to our heritage and our culture. We support our team members in giving back through our volunteer program which grants employees four hours paid time off per month to volunteer. In addition, throughout the year, our Philanthropy and Social Impact team organizes team-building and skills-based volunteer projects, which provide our employees with the opportunity to make a meaningful difference in their communities around the world.\nTrademarks, Copyrights and Patents\nWe seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as many countries as practical, through registered trademarks, copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur toy and game products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, (as amended, the “CPSIA”), The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the “FHSA”), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the “FFA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, a few of our products, are also subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration.\nThe CPSIA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) to take action against hazards presented by consumer products, including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the \n14\nTable of Contents\nCPSIA and to ban it from commerce. The CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the CPSIA and may also order equitable remedies such as recall, replacement, repair or refund for the product. The FHSA provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned.\nConsumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the United States and in many international markets including Canada, Australia, Asia and Europe. We utilize independent third-party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the CPSIA, the FHSA, the FFA, other applicable domestic and international product standards, and our own standards. Any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, depending on the product and scope of the recall, could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well.\nThe Children’s Television Act of 1990 and the rules and regulations of the United States Federal Communications Commission, the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the laws of certain other countries, also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children, and on the collection of information from children, such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"). Legislative changes to COPPA are currently under consideration by the U.S. Congress.\nIn addition to laws restricting the collection of information from children, our business is subject to other regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, which restricts the collection, use, and retention of personal information, as well as data protection laws in the United States and other countries. Failure to comply with any of those restrictions can subject us to severe liabilities. We continue to monitor the developments of regulation in the area of artificial intelligence as this area continues to evolve and we integrate it into our products. \nFurther, we maintain programs to comply with various United States federal, state, local and international requirements relating to the environment, health, safety and other matters.\nOur Executive Officers\nThe following persons are our executive officers.

With over 100 years of expertise, we deliver play experiences for fans of all ages around the world, through physical and digital games, video games, toys, licensed consumer products, location-based entertainment, film, TV and more.\nWe generate revenue and earn cash by developing, marketing, licensing and selling products, play and entertainment experiences, based on our global brands as well as other IP in a broad variety of categories. This includes: innovative toy and gaming brands and role-playing and fantasy card collecting games; the marketing and sale of toys and games, including our owned and partner brands, through retail stores, ecommerce platforms and Hasbro Direct, our direct-to-consumer platform; the distribution, license and sale of digital games developed both internally and through licensing out our IP to third parties, such as Baldur's Gate 3, Monopoly Go! and Magic: The Gathering Arena and other digital games; and entertainment content. Additionally, the Company generates revenue through licensing our brands to third parties for toys and games, consumer products, such as apparel and \n32\nTable of Contents\npublishing, as well as for use in theme park attractions and other forms of location-based entertainment and within formats such as film and TV programming.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nResults of Operations — Consolidated\nThe following table presents the consolidated results of operations for 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\nAmount\n% of Net Revenues\nAmount\n% of Net Revenues\nNet revenues\n$\n4,135.5 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n5,003.3 \n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses\nCost of sales\n1,179.5 \n28.5 \n%\n1,706.0 \n34.1 \n%\nProgram cost amortization\n49.3 \n1.2 \n%\n448.9 \n9.0 \n%\nRoyalties\n284.2 \n6.9 \n%\n428.3 \n8.6 \n%\nProduct development\n294.1 \n7.1 \n%\n306.9 \n6.1 \n%\nAdvertising\n319.5 \n7.7 \n%\n358.4 \n7.2 \n%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n68.3 \n1.7 \n%\n83.0 \n1.7 \n%\nImpairment of goodwill\n— \n— \n%\n1,191.2 \n23.8 \n%\nLoss on disposal of business\n37.4 \n0.9 \n%\n539.0 \n10.8 \n%\nSelling, distribution and administration\n1,213.2 \n29.3 \n%\n1,480.4 \n29.6 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n3,445.5 \n83.3 \n%\n6,542.1 \n130.8 \n%\nOperating profit (loss)\n690.0 \n16.7 \n%\n(1,538.8)\n(30.8)\n%\nNon-operating expense\nInterest expense\n171.2 \n4.1 \n%\n186.3 \n3.7 \n%\nInterest income\n(47.3)\n(1.1)\n%\n(23.0)\n(0.5)\n%\nOther expense, net\n69.1 \n1.7 \n%\n7.0 \n0.1 \n%\nTotal non-operating expense, net\n193.0 \n4.7 \n%\n170.3 \n3.4 \n%\nEarnings (loss) before income taxes\n497.0 \n12.0 \n%\n(1,709.1)\n(34.2)\n%\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n102.6 \n2.5 \n%\n(221.3)\n(4.4)\n%\nNet earnings (loss)\n394.4 \n9.5 \n%\n(1,487.8)\n(29.7)\n%\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n8.8 \n0.2 \n%\n1.5 \n— \n%\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Hasbro, Inc.\n$\n385.6 \n9.3 \n%\n$\n(1,489.3)\n(29.8)\n%\nNet earnings (loss) per common share:\nBasic\n$\n2.77 \n$\n(10.73)\nDiluted\n$\n2.75 \n$\n(10.73)\nNet Revenues\nConsolidated net revenues for the year ended December 29, 2024 decreased 17.3% to $4,135.5 million from $5,003.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a $579.0 million, or 88%, decline in the Entertainment segment as a result of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business during the fourth quarter of 2023 and a $342.5 million, or 12%, decline in the Consumer Products segment, partially offset by a $53.7 million, or 4%, increase in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment. See the Segment Results discussion below for further details.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents net revenues expressed in millions of dollars, by brand portfolio for 2024 and 2023:\nNet Revenues\n2024\n2023\n%\nChange\nFranchise Brands\n$\n3,120.9 \n$\n3,256.5 \n(4)\n%\nPartner Brands\n583.4 \n687.8 \n(15)\n%\nPortfolio Brands\n431.2 \n521.8 \n(17)\n%\nNon-Hasbro Branded Film & TV \n(1)\n— \n537.2 \n(100)\n%\nTotal\n$\n4,135.5 \n$\n5,003.3 \n(17)\n%\n(1)\n Net revenues from the Company's Non-Hasbro-branded Film and TV portfolio were associated with the Company's non-core eOne Film and TV business sold to Lionsgate during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFranchise Brands:\n Our Franchise Brands include our flagship owned or controlled brands, which we believe can deliver significant revenues, profits and growth over the long term, such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING, Hasbro Gaming, PLAY-DOH, TRANSFORMERS, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, PEPPA PIG and NERF. The Franchise Brands portfolio net revenues decreased 4% in 2024 as compared to 2023. The net revenue decrease primarily reflects lower net revenues from NERF, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and TRANSFORMERS products. Net revenues in 2023 were supported by DUNGEONS & DRAGONS digital game and products, most notably \nBaldur's Gate 3\n, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS-based role-playing video game released during the third quarter 2023, as well as theatrical release of \nDungeon & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves \nreleased in March 2023. Additionally, net revenues in 2023 were supported by TRANSFORMERS products from the June 2023 theatrical release of \nTRANSFORMERS: Rise of the Beasts as \ncompared to the late September 2024 theatrical release of \nTransformers One\n. The lower net revenues in 2024 from NERF and TRANSFORMERS products were partially offset by higher net revenues from MONOPOLY GO!.\nPartner Brands:\n \nPartner Brands include those brands we license from other parties for which we develop toy and game products. Partner brand revenues fluctuate based primarily on the entertainment releases around these brands in any given year, such as MARVEL, including SPIDER-MAN and THE AVENGERS, LUCASFILMS' STAR WARS, BEYBLADE, GHOSTBUSTERS, and INDIANA JONES. The Partner Brands portfolio net revenues decreased 15% in 2024 as compared to 2023. During 2024, Partner Brands net revenue decreases were driven by lower net revenues from the Company's products for STAR WARS and MARVEL which benefited from a broader slate of entertainment releases in prior years without a more recent release entertainment release to support revenue in 2024. Additionally, revenue in 2023 was higher due to the Company's products for INDIANA JONES supported by the June 2023 theatrical release of \nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\n.\nPortfolio Brands:\n Portfolio Brands include those brands we own or control which we feel have upside in revenue and profitability that have not yet grown to the significance of a franchise brand. The Portfolio Brands net revenues decreased 17% in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily driven by lower net revenues from POWER RANGERS, PJ MASKS and BABY ALIVE products which were partially offset by revenue contributions from FURBY products following the Company's reintroduction of the brand and refreshed product line during the second quarter of 2023, the release of the next generation of BEYBLADE in 2024, and licensing revenue for MY LITTLE PONY trading cards.\nNon-Hasbro Branded Film & TV:\n Net revenues from the Company's Non-Hasbro-branded Film and TV portfolio were associated with the eOne Film and TV business sold during the fourth quarter of 2023. Effective in the first quarter of 2024, the Company moved the remaining Non-Hasbro Branded Film & TV brands into Portfolio Brands to align with the Company's Brand Strategy. For comparability, net revenues for 2023 have been reclassified to reflect the movement, resulting in a change of $0.5 million.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, in light of the Company's renewed strategy and differing level of investment depending on the growth and margin potential for the brand and business line, the Company will no longer report its brand portfolio based upon the categories described above.\nOPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES\nCost of Sales: \nCost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, manufacturing overhead and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. Cost of sales decreased 30.9% to $1,179.5 million, or 28.5% of net revenues, for 2024 compared to $1,706.0 million, or 34.1% of net revenues, for 2023. The Cost of sales decrease in dollars and as a percent of net revenues was driven primarily by lower sales volumes, lower inventory obsolescence charges, supply chain productivity, and cost savings initiatives, and a $26.7 million benefit related to a historical \n34\nTable of Contents\nover-accrual of vendor commitment liabilities as discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements.\nProgram Cost Amortization: \nProgram cost amortization totaled $49.3 million, or 1.2% of net revenues in 2024, compared to $448.9 million, or 9.0% of net revenues in 2023. The majority of the Company's program costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. The Company also utilizes the percentage of completion methodology, primarily related to unscripted content. Program cost amortization reflects both the phasing of revenues associated with films and television programming, as well as the type of content being produced and distributed. The decrease in dollars and as a percent of net revenues during 2024 was driven by the impact of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business during the fourth quarter of 2023 as prior year Program costs were primarily associated with the eOne Film and TV business.\nRoyalties: \nRoyalty expense totaled $284.2 million, or 6.9% of net revenues, in 2024 compared to $428.3 million, or 8.6% of net revenues, in 2023. Fluctuations in royalty expense generally relate to the volume of entertainment-driven products sold in a given period, especially if the Company is selling product tied to one or more major motion picture releases in the period. The decrease in Royalty expense in dollars and as a percent of net revenues during 2024 directly reflects the impact of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business.\nProduct Development: \nProduct development expense in 2024 totaled $294.1 million, or 7.1% of net revenues, compared to $306.9 million, or 6.1% of net revenues, in 2023. Product development expenditures reflect the Company’s investment in innovation and anticipated growth across our brand portfolio. The decrease in Product development expense during 2024 was driven by cost savings initiatives, along with phasing of product releases.\nAdvertising: \nAdvertising expense in 2024 totaled $319.5 million, or 7.7% of net revenues, compared to $358.4 million or 7.2% of net revenues in 2023. The level of the Company’s advertising expense is generally impacted by revenue mix, the amount and type of theatrical releases and television programming delivered. The Advertising expense decrease during 2024 was primarily driven by the sale of the eOne Film and TV business, along with declines in the advertising expense in the Consumer Products segment due to lower net revenues.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets: \nAmortization of intangible assets decreased to $68.3 million, or 1.7% of net revenues, in 2024 compared to $83.0 million, or 1.7% of net revenues, in 2023. The decrease in 2024 reflects lower definite lived intangible assets due to the sale of the eOne Film and TV business and impairments taken in 2023. See further detail of impairments taken in 2023 in Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on impairment of intangible assets.\nImpairment of Goodwill: \nThere were no goodwill impairment charges during 2024. During 2023, the Company recorded $1,191.2 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges associated with goodwill assigned to the Company's Film and TV reporting unit. See further detail in Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements related to the goodwill impairment charges.\nLoss on Disposal of Business: \nLoss on disposal of business decreased to $37.4 million, or 0.9% of net revenues, in 2024 compared to $539.0 million, or 10.8% of net revenues, in 2023. The Loss on disposal of business for both periods represents the loss recognized associated with the sale of the Company's eOne Film and TV business within the Entertainment segment during 2023. See Note 3, Sale of Entertainment One Film and TV Business, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of the eOne Film and TV business.\nSelling, Distribution and Administration Expenses: \nSelling, distribution and administration expenses decreased to $1,213.2 million, or 29.3% of net revenues in 2024, from $1,480.4 million, or 29.6% of net revenues, in 2023. The decrease in Selling, distribution and administration expenses in dollars and as a percent of net revenues during the 2024 primarily reflects lower administrative expenses due to cost savings initiatives, a prior year intangible asset impairment charges of $65.0 million related to the Company's eOne trademark intangible asset and $51.0 million related to the Company's PJ MASKS intangible asset, along with a non-recurring stock-compensation favorable adjustment of $18.1 million recorded during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by a non-recurring $31.1 million expense related to historical environmental exposures as discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements.\nNON-OPERATING EXPENSE (INCOME)\nInterest Expense: \nInterest expense totaled $171.2 million in 2024 compared to $186.3 million in 2023. The decrease in Interest expense during 2024 primarily reflects lower average outstanding borrowings in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to the assumption of the production financing borrowings by Lionsgate as part of the eOne Film and TV business and due to the retirement of the Company's variable-rate Five-Year term loan using proceeds from the sale of the eOne Film and TV business, both occurring during the fourth quarter of 2023, the full payment \n35\nTable of Contents\nof the 2024 Notes and repurchases of the 2026 Notes during the fourth quarter of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by the issuance of the 2034 Notes (see Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for further information including description of the partial payments of the 2026 Notes and the issuance of the 2034 Notes).\nInterest Income: \nInterest income was $47.3 million in 2024 compared to $23.0 million in 2023. Higher Interest income in 2024 primarily reflects higher average interest rates in 2024 compared to 2023, along with the Company's investment in short-term treasury bills in connection with the issuance of the 2034 Notes that fully matured in the fourth quarter of 2024 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for further information including description of the 2034 Notes).\nOther Expense, Net: \nOther expense, net was $69.1 million in 2024 compared to Other expense, net of $7.0 million in 2023. The change in Other expense, net during 2024 was driven primarily by an impairment loss of $78.2 million related to our joint venture investment in the Discovery Family Channel as discussed in Note 8, Equity Method Investment, in our consolidated financial statements.\nINCOME TAXES\n \nIncome tax expense totaled $102.6 million on pre-tax income of $497.0 million during 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of $221.3 million on pre-tax loss of $1,709.1 million during 2023. During 2024, the Company incurred a $37.4 million unfavorable adjustment to the 2023 Loss on sale of the Film & TV reporting unit with no corresponding tax benefit. Absent the unfavorable adjustment to the loss on sale with no corresponding tax benefit, the Company recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $13.1 million, primarily associated with a benefit from the release of uncertain tax positions for certain statute of limitation expirations, and favorable return to provision adjustments. Fiscal year 2023 includes discrete items related to an impairment of goodwill in our Family Brands reporting unit of $960.0 million with no tax benefit and an impairment of goodwill in the Film and TV reporting unit of $231.2 million with no tax benefit. Exclusive of the goodwill impairments, the Company recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $278.7 million. This benefit is primarily related to two items: (i) the Company recognized tax benefits of $124.0 million associated with the impairment of trade names in our Film and TV reporting unit, as well as loss on assets held for sale, and (ii) during 2023, the Company concluded its discussions with the tax authorities in Switzerland as to the application of the grandfathering rules related to 2020 Swiss Tax Reform. This resulted in the recording of a deferred tax asset of $135.6 million related to tax intangibles that will be amortized over time and result in a future cash tax benefit. This treatment applies starting in 2021.\nSubsequent to the United States passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), the Company has greater flexibility to manage cash globally. The Company intends to repatriate the accumulated foreign earnings as needed from time to time. The Company still has significant cash needs outside the United States and continues to consistently monitor and analyze its global working capital and cash requirements. As of 2024, we have recorded $4.6 million of foreign withholding and U.S. state income tax liability. The Company will continue to record additional tax effects, if any, in the period that the on-going distribution analysis is completed and is able to make reasonable estimates.\nTax laws are regularly being re-examined and evaluated globally. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as \"Pillar 2\"). Certain aspects of Pillar 2 were effective in 2024, which were not material to the Company’s financial statements, and other aspects are effective January 1, 2025. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either (i) enacted legislation to adopt certain components of Pillar 2 beginning in 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with delayed adoption of other components; or (ii) announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. We continue to evaluate the impacts of enacted and pending legislation related to Pillar 2 in our non-US tax jurisdictions.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our segments: Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast & Digital Gaming and Entertainment. Corporate and Other, which does not meet the criteria to be an operating segment, provides management and administrative services to the Company's principal reporting segments and consists of unallocated corporate expenses and administrative costs and activities not considered when evaluating segment performance as well as certain assets benefiting more than one segment.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents net external revenues and operating profit (loss) for the Company's reportable segments for 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\n%\nChange\nNet revenues:\nConsumer Products\n$\n2,543.9 \n$\n2,886.4 \n(12)\n%\nWizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming\n1,511.3 \n1,457.6 \n4 \n%\nEntertainment\n80.3 \n659.3 \n(88)\n%\nTotal net revenues\n$\n4,135.5 \n$\n5,003.3 \n(17)\n%\nOperating profit (loss):\nConsumer Products\n$\n115.3 \n$\n(64.7)\n278 \n%\nWizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming\n632.0 \n525.7 \n20 \n%\nEntertainment\n(1.6)\n(1,911.5)\n100 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n(55.7)\n(88.3)\n37 \n%\nTotal Operating profit (loss)\n$\n690.0 \n$\n(1,538.8)\n145 \n%\nConsumer Products Segment\nThe following table presents the Consumer Products segment net revenues by major geographic region for 2024 and 2023:\nNet Revenues\n2024\n2023\n%\nChange\nNorth America\n$\n1,493.0 \n$\n1,649.1 \n(9)\n%\nEurope\n519.7 \n669.5 \n(22)\n%\nAsia Pacific\n286.7 \n256.3 \n12 \n%\nLatin America\n244.5 \n311.5 \n(22)\n%\nNet Revenues\n$\n2,543.9 \n$\n2,886.4 \n(12)\n%\nConsumer Products segment net revenues decreased 12% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by exited businesses, including out-licensing certain brands, shifts in product mix, reduced closeout sales as a result of last year's inventory clean up initiatives, and broader industry trends, . The net revenue decrease primarily reflects lower net revenues from NERF, STAR WARS and MARVEL products, POWER RANGERS, Hasbro Gaming, and TRANSFORMERS. The net revenue decrease from lower net revenues from the Company's products for STAR WARS and MARVEL benefited from a slate of entertainment releases in prior years without a more recent release entertainment release to support revenue in 2024. Additionally, net revenues from TRANSFORMERS products in 2023 were supported by the June 2023 theatrical release of \nTRANSFORMERS: Rise of the Beasts \ncompared to the late September 2024 theatrical release of \nTransformers One\n. These revenue decreases were partially offset by revenue contributions from FURBY products following the Company's reintroduction of the brand and refreshed product line during the second quarter of 2023, BEYBLADE products following the Company's refreshed product line in 2024, and licensing revenue for MY LITTLE PONY trading cards.\nConsumer Products segment operating results increased $180.0 million to an operating income of $115.3 million in 2024, compared to an operating loss of $64.7 million in 2023. Operating profit margin increase to 4.5% of net revenues in 2024 from an operating loss margin of 2.2% of net revenues in 2023. The increase in operating profit in 2024 was driven by favorable licensing product mix, supply chain productivity, and cost savings realized from cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the lower sale volumes contributions.\n37\nTable of Contents\nWizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming Segment\nThe following table presents Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment net revenues by category for 2024 and 2023:\nNet Revenues\n2024\n2023\n%\nChange\nTabletop Gaming\n$\n1,039.6 \n$\n1,072.5 \n(3)\n%\nDigital and Licensed Gaming\n471.7 \n385.1 \n22 \n%\nNet Revenues\n$\n1,511.3 \n$\n1,457.6 \n4 \n%\nWizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment net revenues increased 4% in 2024 compared to 2023. Tabletop Gaming revenue decreased 3% primarily attributable to timing releases for MAGIC: THE GATHERING sets resulting in few releases in 2024 as compared to 2023. Digital and Licensed Gaming increased 22% due to strong demand for MONOPOLY GO!, partially offset by the decrease in net revenue recognized from the digital licensing of \nBaldur's Gate 3\n, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS-based role-playing video game that was released during the third quarter 2023.\nWizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment operating profit increased $106.3 million to $632.0 million in 2024, compared to $525.7 million in 2023. Operating profit margin increased to 41.8% in 2024 from 36.1% in 2023. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by increased net revenues, contributions from higher digital licensing revenue mix, lower royalty expense, and cost savings initiatives.\nEntertainment Segment\nThe following table presents Entertainment segment net revenues by category for 2024 and 2023:\nNet Revenues\n2024\n2023\n%\nChange\nFilm and TV\n$\n6.6 \n$\n575.5 \n(99)\n%\nFamily Brands\n73.7 \n83.8 \n(12)\n%\nNet Revenues\n$\n80.3 \n$\n659.3 \n(88)\n%\nEntertainment segment net revenues decreased 88% in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by lower net revenues as a result of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe Entertainment segment operating loss increased to an operating loss of $1.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $1,911.5 million in 2023. The increase in Entertainment segment operating results in 2024 was driven by non-cash impairment charges in 2023 comprised of a goodwill impairment charge of $1,191.2 million primarily associated Company's eOne Film and TV business; a loss on disposal of business of $539.0 million related to the sale of the eOne Film and TV business; and intangible asset impairment charges of $65.0 million and $51.0 million related to definite-lived intangible assets for the eOne Trademark and PJ MASKS, respectively.\nCorporate and Other\nIn Corporate and Other, the operating losses were $55.7 million in 2024 compared to operating losses of $88.3 million in 2023. Improved operating results in 2024 reflects cost savings realized from cost savings initiatives and a benefit from the net impact of the three non-recurring prior period adjustments recorded during 2024. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements for further information on these non-recurring adjustments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The critical accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company’s reported financial results include the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes.\n38\nTable of Contents\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of the acquired business in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with each acquisition. We assess goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. For goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, our policy is to assess for impairment as of the beginning of each fiscal fourth quarter. The Company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative impairment testing process, if it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. For other intangible assets with definite lives, we assess for impairment only if events occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nOur fiscal year 2024 assessment for impairment of goodwill, with respect to each of its reporting units, was performed using a qualitative approach to determine, as of the date of the assessment, whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill was less than its carrying value. In performing the qualitative assessment, we identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair value of goodwill. These factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. Based on our qualitative fiscal year 2024 annual impairment analysis for goodwill, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements for more information on the Company's goodwill.\nOur fiscal year 2024 assessment for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was based on a relief from royalty method, including key assumptions such as the long-term growth rates of future revenues, the royalty rate for such revenues, and a discount rate. The fair value of each intangible asset is determined for comparison to the corresponding carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Based on our fiscal year 2024 annual impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we concluded that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded their respective carrying values by substantial margins.\nIntangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. During 2024, there were no triggering events which would indicate the Company's intangible assets were impaired.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the Company’s annual tax rate and evaluate its tax positions. Despite the Company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established to account for events in which these positions are challenged, and the Company is not successful in defending those challenges. These estimated liabilities, as well as the related interest, are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.\nIn certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the Company’s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized in the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Company’s tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. The differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the Company’s income tax returns. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the Company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Company’s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the Company’s income tax return.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements.\n39\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. The Company has primarily funded its operations and liquidity needs through cash on hand and from cash flows from operations, and when needed, used commercial paper and borrowings under its available lines of credit. As of December 29, 2024, the Company had $695.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents and $3,401.8 million of Long-term debt.\nThe Company may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, to provide additional sources of liquidity when pursuing opportunities to enhance its long-term competitive position, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. However, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or the inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. Although the Company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the Company.\nIndebtedness and Credit Facilities\nAs of December 29, 2024, the Company had $3,401.8 million of Long-term debt due at varying times from 2026 through 2044. In May 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of $500.0 million of senior unsecured debt securities that bears a fixed interest of 6.05% due 2034 (the \"2034 Notes\"). Proceeds from the 2034 Notes, along with existing cash available, were utilized to repay the aggregate of $500.0 million of 3.00% Notes Due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\"). \nThe Company's third amended and restated revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. maturing September 5, 2028 (the \"Amended Revolving Credit Agreement\"), provides the Company with a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion and also provides for a potential additional incremental commitment increase of up to $500.0 million subject to agreement of the lenders. The Amended Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 29, 2024. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility as of December 29, 2024. However, letters of credit outstanding under this facility were approximately $3.7 million. Amounts available and unused under the committed line, as of December 29, 2024 were approximately $1.25 billion, inclusive of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $7.6 million was utilized in the form of letters of credit, on December 29, 2024.\nThe Company has a supplier finance program which provides participating suppliers the option of receiving payment in advance of an invoice due date, to be paid by certain administering banks, on the basis of invoices that the Company has confirmed as valid and approved. The Company’s obligation is to make payment in the invoice amount negotiated with participating suppliers, to the administering banks on the invoice due date. The Company’s suppliers are not required to participate in the supplier finance program. The early payment transactions between the Company’s supplier and the administering bank are subject to an agreement between those parties, and the Company does not participate in any financial aspect of the agreements between the Company’s suppliers and the administering banks. The Company has not pledged any assets to the administering bank under the supplier financing program. The Company or the administering bank may terminate the agreement upon at least 30 days’ written notice. The amount of obligations confirmed under the supplier finance program that remain unpaid were $66.2 million, and $43.3 million as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These obligations are presented within Accounts payable in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to this program is reflected within the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFrom time to time, the Company or its affiliates may seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. During 2024, the Company repurchased $83.1 million of its 2026 Notes.\nSee Note 11, Long-Term Debt and Other Financing, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on outstanding long-term debt and credit facilities.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow\nThe following table presents the cash flow activities for 2024 and 2023:\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n2024\n2023\nOperating Activities\n$\n847.4 \n$\n725.6 \nInvesting Activities\n(203.7)\n117.6 \nFinancing Activities\n(497.5)\n(818.1)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n3.4 \n7.2 \nIncrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n149.6 \n$\n32.3 \nOperating Activities:\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $847.4 million in 2024 as compared to $725.6 million in 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2024 after adjusting for non-cash items, was primarily attributable to improved net earnings in 2024 compared to 2023, and working capital benefits, primarily due to lower investments in entertainment content compared to 2023 as a result of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business, and reduced inventory due to management inventory initiatives. \nInvesting Activities:\nNet cash flows utilized for investing activities was $203.7 million in 2024 compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of $117.6 million in 2023. Investing activities in 2024 primarily reflects $571.0 million of purchases of short-term investments from proceeds of the issuance of the 2034 Notes, $583.0 million maturity of short-term investments used to repay the 2024 Notes, $87.2 million of additions of property, plant, and equipment, and $110.3 million for software development additions. Investing activities in 2023 primarily reflect net proceeds of $329.6 million from the sale of the eOne Film and TV Business, $135.5 million of additions of property, plant, and equipment, and $73.8 million for software development additions.\nWe expect total cash capital expenditures in fiscal year 2025 to be between $225 million and $250 million. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with available cash or cash generated from operations.\nFinancing Activities:\nNet cash utilized by financing activities was $497.5 million and $818.1 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Financing activities in 2024 primarily include $498.6 million of proceeds from issuance of the 2034 Notes, dividends paid of $389.9 million, repayments of long-term debt of $581.3 million related to the 3% Notes due 2024 of $500 million and the repurchase of $83.1 million of its Notes due 2026, and $14.4 million of payments related to tax withholdings for stock compensation coinciding with equity award vesting activity. \nFinancing activities in 2023 primarily include repayments of long-term debt of $359.6 million primarily related to the repayment of debt in connection with the sale of the eOne Film and TV Business, dividends paid of $388.0 million, and $16.8 million of payments related to tax withholdings for stock compensation coinciding with equity award vesting activity. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets. Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n•\nDebt – See Note 11, Long-Term Debt and Other Financing, in our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our debt, including letters of credit, and the timing of expected future principal payments.\n•\nOperating lease obligations – Note 17, Leases, in our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n•\nPension plans and other postretirement benefit contributions – We sponsor a defined benefit plan that pays benefits to eligible employees at retirement. In addition, we provide certain postretirement health and welfare benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents. See Note 16, Retirement Plans, in our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n•\nMinimum Guarantee Payments – The Company enters into license agreements with strategic partners, inventors, designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in its products. Certain of these \n41\nTable of Contents\nagreements contain provisions for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts. See Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our obligations and the expected timing of expected future payments.\n•\nPurchase and Other Obligations – The Company also has various third-party, inventory and tooling purchase commitments in the ordinary course of business. See Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our obligations and the expected timing of expected future payments.\n•\nUncertain Tax Positions – As of December 29, 2024, the Company has a liability of $45.6 million of potential tax, interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. The Company does not know the ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know the ultimate amount or timing of payments related to this liability.\nWe believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes:\n•\nOur cash flow from operations;\n•\nThe availability of additional capital under our commercial paper program or lines of credit; and\n•\nOur availability to access capital from financial markets.\nFinancial Risk Management\nThe Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries.\nTo manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. At December 29, 2024, the Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate $15.1 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be offset by increases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions.\nThe Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Company’s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Company’s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.\nThe Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 29, 2024, these contracts had net unrealized gains of $0.5 million, of which $1.7 million are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, $1.2 million are recorded in Accrued liabilities. Included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 29, 2024 are deferred losses of $4.4 million, net of tax, related to these derivatives.\nAt December 29, 2024, the Company had fixed rate long-term debt of $3,401.8 million. The Company does not have any interest rate swaps on its existing long-term debt.\nIndustry Trends, the Economy and Inflation\nThe principal market for the Company’s toys and games and licensed consumer products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Company’s top five retail customers, accounted for approximately 36% of its consolidated net revenues in 2024. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.\nThe Company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2024 approximately 58% of the Company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. The Company expects that this concentration will continue. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is \n42\nTable of Contents\ncharacterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. Larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season, which includes Christmas. Quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers as well as growth in ecommerce result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Company’s future revenues. The Company is continuing to manage inventory levels and by monitoring consumer purchase patterns to ensure adequate supply of new product while clearing excess supply to mitigate the risk of inventory obsolescence.\nIn addition to these inventory management challenges, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the Company’s future revenues.\nUnlike the Company's retail sales patterns, revenue patterns from the Company's entertainment businesses fluctuate based on the timing and popularity of content releases. In addition, entertainment business operating results fluctuate due to expenses recorded in relation to productions and content such as program amortization costs and advertising expenses, which are incurred and recognized, beginning prior to initial releases and then continue throughout the related distribution windows.\nInflation\nThe impact of inflation on the Company's business operations was significant during 2024. The Company monitors the impact of inflation to its business operations on an ongoing basis and may need to implement actions such as price adjustments to mitigate the impact of changes to the rate of inflation in future periods. However, future volatility of general price inflation could affect consumer spending. Additionally, the impact of inflation on costs and availability of materials, costs for shipping and warehousing and other operational overhead, could adversely affect the Company's financial results.",
