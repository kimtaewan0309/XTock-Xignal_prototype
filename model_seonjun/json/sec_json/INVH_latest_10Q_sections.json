MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCapitalized terms used without definition have the meaning provided elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nInvitation Homes is a leading owner and operator of single-family homes for lease, offering residents high-quality homes in sought-after neighborhoods across the United States. As of September 30, 2025, we wholly own 86,139 homes for lease, jointly own 7,897 homes for lease, and provide professional third-party property and asset management services for an additional 16,151 homes, all of which are primarily located in 16 core markets across the country. These homes help meet the needs of a growing share of Americans who prefer the ease of a leasing lifestyle over the burden of owning a home. We provide our residents access to updated homes with features they value, as well as close proximity to jobs and access to good schools. The continued demand for our product proves that the choice and flexibility we offer are attractive to many people.\nWe operate in markets with strong demand drivers, high barriers to entry, and high rent growth potential, primarily in the Western United States, Florida, and the Southeast United States. Through disciplined market and asset selection, as well as through strategic mergers and acquisitions, we designed our wholly and jointly owned portfolios to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated. Since our founding in 2012, we have built a proven, vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire, renovate, lease, maintain, and manage both the homes we own and those we manage on behalf of others. \nThe portfolio of homes we own average approximately 1,880 square feet with three to four bedrooms and two bathrooms, appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than a typical multifamily resident. We invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs, reduce ongoing maintenance costs, and drive resident demand. \nAt Invitation Homes, we are committed to creating a better way to live and to being a force for positive change, which is underscored by our recently updated company purpose to Unlock the Power of Home™. Our Genuine CARE™ values serve as the foundation for our work, and the underlying principles of clear communication, integrity, responsibility, innovation, adaptability, and a welcoming workplace were designed to create an authentic experience for our residents, shareholders, and associates. We also work to advance sustainability, which is an important part of our strategic business objectives and is critical to our long-term success.\nOur commitment to high-touch customer service continuously enhances residents’ living experiences and provides homes where individuals and families can thrive. Each aspect of our operations — whether in our corporate headquarters or field offices located in our 16 core markets — is driven by a resident-centric model. Our associates take our values seriously and work hard every day to honor the trust our residents have placed in us to provide clean, safe, and functional homes for them and their loved ones. In turn, we focus on ensuring that our associates are fairly compensated and that we provide a culture that values respect, opportunity, and belonging. We also place a strong emphasis on the impact we have in our communities and to the environment in general, and we continue to develop programs that demonstrate those commitments. In addition, we ensure that we operate under strong, well-defined governance practices and adhere to the highest ethical standards at all times.  \n41\nImpact of Macroeconomic Trends\nGeneral economic conditions in the United States have fluctuated in recent quarters, and concerns persist regarding adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, elevated interest rates, political dissension, and labor shortfalls. Such macroeconomic factors coupled with uncertainty in financial markets (including as a result of events affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures), ongoing geopolitical tensions, and a general decline in business activity and/or consumer confidence could adversely affect (i)\n \nour occupancy levels, our rental rates, and collections, (ii) our ability to acquire or dispose of properties on economically favorable terms, (iii) our access to financial markets on attractive terms, or at all, and (iv)\n \nthe value of our homes and our business that could cause us to recognize impairments in value of our tangible assets or goodwill. Inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, bank failures, and other fluctuating global and regional economic conditions, as well as geopolitical events, may also negatively impact consumer income, credit availability, interest rates, and spending, among other factors, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, including the ability of our residents to pay rent. These factors, which include labor shortages and inflationary increases in labor and material costs, have impacted and may continue to impact certain aspects of our business. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, declines in income or asset values, and other macroeconomic factors. Imposition or increase of tariffs and trade restrictions by the United States on imports from certain countries and counter-tariffs in response could lead to increased costs and supply chain disruptions. If we are not able to navigate any such changes, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as on the price of our common stock.\nWhile the degree to which we may continue to be affected by these macroeconomic challenges largely depends on the nature and duration of uncertain and unpredictable events, we believe that we are well suited to endure a shifting macroeconomic environment due to our diversification and resiliency. For further discussion of risks related to general economic conditions, see Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business Environment and Industry — \nOur operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets\n” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nClimate Change\nPotential consequences of global climate change may range from more frequent extreme weather events to extensive governmental policy developments and shifts in consumer preferences, which have the potential individually or collectively to disrupt our business as well as negatively affect our suppliers, contractors, and residents. Experiencing or addressing the various physical, regulatory, and transition risks from climate change may significantly reduce our revenues and profitability or cause us to generate losses. We are subject to evolving laws and regulations relating to climate change, promulgated by governmental and regulatory organizations, including regulations aimed at drastically increasing reporting and governance related to climate change as well as focused on limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of “green” building codes. \nEvolving laws and regulations or any changed interpretation of such laws and regulations may require us to make costly improvements to our existing properties beyond our current plans to decrease the impact of our homes on the environment, resulting in increased operating costs and compliance burdens. Incorporating greater resource efficiency into our homes, whether to comply with upgraded building codes or recommended practices given a region’s particular exposure to climate conditions or undertaken to satisfy demand from increasingly environmentally conscious residents and investors or to meet our own sustainability goals, could raise our costs to maintain our homes. In evaluating whether to implement voluntary improvements, we also consider that choosing not to enhance our homes’ resource efficiency can make them less attractive to municipalities and increase the vulnerability of residents in our communities to rising energy and water expenses and use restrictions. Choosing not to enhance our homes’ resource efficiency could make our portfolio less attractive to residents and investors. Additionally, disclosure obligations relating to sustainability matters are complex and not always consistent, making compliance difficult and uncertain. If we fail to manage transition risks effectively, our profitability and cash flow could suffer.\nWe intend to continue to research, evaluate, and utilize new or improved products and business practices consistent with our sustainability commitment. We believe our initiatives in this area can help put us in a better position to comply with evolving regulations directed at addressing climate change and similar environmental concerns and to meet growing resident demand for resource-efficient homes, as further discussed in Part I. Item 1. “Business — Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n42\nWe recognize that climate change could have a significant impact on our portfolio of homes located in a variety of markets across the United States and that an increase in the number of acute weather events, natural disasters, and other climate-related events could significantly impact our business, operations, and homes. We actively consider physical risks such as the potential for natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires when assessing our portfolio of homes and our business processes. Such extreme climate related events are driving changes in market dynamics and stakeholder expectations and could result in disruptions to us, our suppliers, vendors, and residents. We recognize that we must continue to adapt our policies, objectives, and processes to prepare for such events and improve the resiliency of our physical properties and our business.\nOur management and the board of directors are focused on managing our business risks, including climate change-related risks. The process to identify, manage, and integrate climate-change risk is part of our comprehensive enterprise risk management program. Our board of directors, through its Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, is responsible for oversight of our management of risks related to environmental issues, climate related risks, and social issues. For more information on risks related to climate change, see Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Sustainability, Corporate Responsibility, and Governance — \nClimate change and related environmental issues, related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, and the transition to a lower-carbon economy may adversely affect our business\n, — \nWe are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, and severe weather, \nand — \nWe are subject to increasing scrutiny from investors and others regarding our sustainability responsibilities, which could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation, associate attraction and retention, and ability to raise capital\n” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Matters\nIn January\n \n2023, we received an inquiry from the staff of the SEC requesting information relating to our compliance with building codes and permitting requirements, related policies and procedures, and other matters. We are in the process of responding to, and cooperating with, this request. We cannot currently predict the timing, outcome, or scope of this inquiry.\n43\nOur Portfolio\nThe following table provides summary information regarding our total and Same Store portfolios as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as noted below:\nMarket\nNumber of Homes\n(1)\nAverage Occupancy\n(2)\nAverage Monthly\nRent\n(3)\nAverage Monthly\nRent PSF\n(3)\n% of\nRevenue\n(4)\nWestern United States:\nSouthern California\n7,154\n95.6%\n$3,213\n$1.88\n10.8 \n%\nNorthern California\n4,027\n96.8%\n2,799\n1.77\n5.4 \n%\nSeattle\n3,925\n97.9%\n2,952\n1.54\n5.6 \n%\nPhoenix\n9,208\n96.6%\n2,075\n1.22\n9.4 \n%\nLas Vegas\n3,394\n96.2%\n2,252\n1.15\n3.7 \n%\nDenver\n2,915\n93.6%\n2,641\n1.43\n3.6 \n%\nWestern United States Subtotal\n30,623\n96.2%\n2,622\n1.49\n38.5 \n%\nFlorida:\nSouth Florida\n8,111\n95.0%\n3,131\n1.67\n11.8 \n%\nTampa\n9,678\n93.2%\n2,311\n1.23\n10.8 \n%\nOrlando\n6,920\n95.0%\n2,283\n1.22\n7.7 \n%\nJacksonville\n2,125\n94.2%\n2,198\n1.11\n2.2 \n%\nFlorida Subtotal\n26,834\n94.2%\n2,548\n1.35\n32.5 \n%\nSoutheast United States:\nAtlanta\n12,641\n95.3%\n2,106\n1.02\n12.6 \n%\nCarolinas\n6,138\n94.5%\n2,103\n1.00\n6.1 \n%\nSoutheast United States Subtotal\n18,779\n95.1%\n2,105\n1.01\n18.7 \n%\nTexas:\nHouston\n2,511\n91.5%\n1,957\n0.99\n2.3 \n%\nDallas\n3,543\n89.3%\n2,270\n1.12\n3.7 \n%\nTexas Subtotal\n6,054\n89.3%\n2,144\n1.07\n6.0 \n%\nMidwest United States:\nChicago\n2,453\n94.6%\n2,521\n1.57\n2.8 \n%\nMinneapolis\n1,042\n93.9%\n2,435\n1.24\n1.2 \n%\nMidwest United States Subtotal\n3,495\n94.4%\n2,496\n1.46\n4.0 \n%\nOther\n(5)\n:\n354\n75.4%\n2,142\n1.13\n0.3 \n%\nTotal / Average\n86,139\n94.8%\n$2,447\n$1.30\n100.0 \n%\nSame Store Total / Average\n77,284\n96.5%\n$2,461\n$1.31\n91.9 \n%\n(1)\nAs of September 30, 2025.\n(2)\nRepresents average occupancy for the three months ended September 30, 2025.\n(3)\nRepresents average monthly rent for the three months ended September 30, 2025.\n(4)\nRepresents the percentage of rental revenues and other property income generated in each market for the three months ended September 30, 2025.\n(5)\nRepresents homes located outside of our 16 core markets as of September 30, 2025, primarily in Nashville and San Antonio. \n44\nFactors That Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding factors that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals, rental rates and occupancy levels, collection rates, turnover rates and days to re-resident homes, property improvements and maintenance, property acquisitions and renovations, and financing arrangements. Sensitivity to many of these factors has been heightened as a result of current macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, elevated interest rates, political dissension, labor shortfalls, and adverse global economic conditions. Additionally, each of these factors may also impact the results of operations and financial condition of our joint venture investments and those of third parties for whom we perform property and asset management services, which would impact the amount of management fee revenues and income (losses) from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that we earn.\nMarket Fundamentals:\n \nOur results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets, particularly in the Western United States and Florida, which represented 71.0% of our rental revenues and other property income during the three months ended September 30, 2025. We actively monitor the impact of macroeconomic conditions on market fundamentals and quickly implement changes in pricing as market fundamentals shift.\nRental Rates and Occupancy Levels:\n Rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income. Our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and property-level factors, including market conditions, seasonality, resident defaults, and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and re-lease homes when residents vacate. An important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases, which typically have a term of one to two years.\nCollection Rates: \nOur rental revenues and other property income are impacted by the rate at which we collect such revenues from our residents. Despite our efforts to assist residents facing financial hardships who need flexibility to fulfill their lease obligations, a portion of amounts receivable may not ultimately be collected. We may also be constrained in our ability to collect resident receivables due to local ordinances restricting residential lease compliance options. Any amounts billed to residents that have been deemed uncollectible along with our estimate of amounts that may ultimately be uncollectible decrease our rental revenues and other property income.\nTurnover Rates and Days to Re-Resident:\n Other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include the length of stay of our residents, resident turnover rates, and the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents. Our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property, which is a component of the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents. The period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand, our marketing techniques, the size of our available inventory, the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks and/or source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business, and both current economic conditions and future economic outlook, including the impact of inflation, elevated interest rates, political dissension, and labor shortfalls which could adversely affect demand for our properties.\nProperty Improvements and Maintenance:\n Property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures, property operating and maintenance expense, and rental revenues. We actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures. As a result of inflationary trends and/or imposition of or increases in tariffs, we may experience, as we have in the past, increased costs for certain materials and services necessary to improve and maintain our homes. We continue to actively manage the impact of these factors on these costs, and we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices compared to other purchasers due to our size and scale both nationally and locally.\nProperty Acquisitions and Renovations:\n Future growth in rental revenues and other property income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes, our pace of property acquisitions, and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home. Our ability to identify and acquire single-family homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations, the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels, and competition for our target assets. All of these factors may be negatively impacted by current inflationary trends and elevated interest rates, potentially reducing the number of homes we acquire.\n45\nThe acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price, including payments for acquisition fees, property inspections, closing costs, title insurance, transfer taxes, recording fees, broker commissions, property taxes, and HOA fees (when applicable). Additionally, we incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental. The scope of renovation work varies, but may include paint, flooring, carpeting, cabinetry, appliances, plumbing hardware, roof replacement, HVAC replacement, and other items required to prepare the home for rental. The time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance. The time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons, including the property’s acquisition channel, the condition of the property, whether the property was vacant when acquired, and whether there are any state or local restrictions on our ability to complete renovations as an essential business function. Additionally, the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks and/or source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business have increased the time required to renovate our homes. As a result of inflationary trends and/or imposition of or increases in tariffs, we may experience, as we have in the past, increased costs for certain materials and services necessary to renovate our homes. We continue to actively manage these factors on the cost of renovations, and we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices compared to other purchasers due to our size and scale both nationally and locally.\nFinancing Arrangements:\n Financing arrangements directly impact our interest expense, our various debt instruments, and our ability to acquire and renovate homes. We have historically utilized indebtedness to fund the acquisition and renovation of new homes. Our current financing arrangements contain financial covenants and other terms and conditions, including variable interest rates in some cases, that are impacted by market conditions. Current macroeconomic conditions may continue to negatively affect volatility, availability of funds, and transaction costs (including interest rates) within financial markets. These factors may also negatively affect our ability to access financial markets as well as our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Part I. Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for further discussion regarding interest rate risk. Our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts, interest rates, financial covenants, and durations.\nMacroeconomics Conditions:\n Inflation, elevated interest rates, political dissension, labor shortfalls, and adverse global economic conditions could negatively affect our business and financial condition. Imposition of, increases in, and changing policies around tariffs by the United States on imports from certain countries and potential counter-tariffs in response could lead to increased costs and supply chain disruptions. If we are not able to navigate any such changes, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as on the price of our common stock.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nThe following is a description of the components of our revenues and expenses.\nRevenues\nRental Revenues and Other Property Income\nRental revenues, net of any concessions and bad debt (including write-offs, credit reserves, and uncollectible amounts), consist of rents collected under lease agreements related to our single-family homes for lease. We enter into leases directly with our residents, and the leases typically have a term of one to two years.\nOther property income is comprised of: (i) resident reimbursements for utilities, HOA fines, and other charge-backs; (ii) rent and non-refundable deposits associated with pets; (iii) revenues from value-add services such as smart homes, internet and media packages, home liability insurance, and HVAC replacement filters; and (iv) various other fees, including late fees and lease termination fees, among others.\nManagement Fee Revenues\nManagement fee revenues consist of fees from property and asset management services provided to portfolio owners of single-family homes for lease, including investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures.\n46\nExpenses\nProperty Operating and Maintenance \nOnce a property is available for its initial lease, which we refer to as “rent-ready,” we incur ongoing property-related expenses, which consist primarily of property taxes, insurance, HOA fees (when applicable), market-level personnel expenses, utility expenses, repairs and maintenance, and property administration. Prior to a property being “rent-ready,” certain of these expenses are capitalized as building and improvements. Once a property is “rent-ready,” expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance thereafter are expensed as incurred, and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home.\nProperty Management Expense\nProperty management expense represents personnel and other costs associated with the oversight and management of our portfolio of homes, including those for which we provide property and asset management services on behalf of others through our internal property manager.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense represents personnel costs, professional fees, and other costs associated with our day-to-day activities. General and administrative expense may also include expenses that are of a non-recurring nature, such as severance.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nWe issue share-based awards to align the interests of our associates with those of our investors, and all share-based compensation expense is recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as components of general and administrative expense and property management expense.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest payable on our debt instruments, payments and receipts related to our interest rate swap agreements, amortization of discounts and deferred financing costs, unrealized gains (losses) on non-designated hedging instruments, and non-cash interest expense related to our interest rate swap agreements.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe recognize depreciation and amortization expense associated with our homes and other capital expenditures over the expected useful lives of the assets.\nCasualty Losses, Impairment, and Other\nCasualty losses, impairment, and other represents provisions for impairment when the carrying amount of our single-family residential properties is not recoverable and casualty (gains) losses, net of any insurance recoveries.\nGains (Losses) on Investments in Equity and Other Securities, net\nGains (losses) on investments in equity and other securities, net includes unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark to market adjustments and realized gains and losses recognized upon the sale or settlement of certain investments in equity securities and warrants.\nOther, net\nOther, net includes settlement and other costs related to certain litigation and regulatory matters, interest income, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. \nGain on Sale of Property, net of tax\nGain on sale of property, net of tax consists of net gains and losses resulting from sales of our homes.\n47\nIncome (Losses) from Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nIncome (losses) from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our share of net earnings and losses from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.\nResults of Operations\nPortfolio Information\nAs of September 30, 2025 and 2024, we owned 86,139 and 85,221 single-family rental homes, respectively, in our total portfolio. During the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we acquired 526 and 891 homes, respectively, and sold 292 and 310 homes, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we owned an average of 86,016 and 84,753 single-family rental homes, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we acquired 2,042 and 1,591 homes, respectively, and sold 1,041 and 937 homes, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we owned an average of 85,573 and 84,567 single-family rental homes, respectively.\nWe believe presenting information about the portion of our total portfolio that has been fully operational for the entirety of both a given reporting period and its prior year comparison period provides investors with meaningful information about the performance of our comparable homes across periods and about trends in our organic business. To do so, we provide information regarding the performance of our Same Store portfolio.\nAs of September 30, 2025, our Same Store portfolio consisted of 77,284 single-family rental homes.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nFor the Three Months\nEnded September 30,\n($ in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nRevenues:\nRental revenues and other property income\n$\n666,191 \n$\n641,342 \n$\n24,849 \n3.9 \n%\nManagement fee revenues\n21,975 \n18,980 \n2,995 \n15.8 \n%\nTotal revenues\n688,166 \n660,322 \n27,844 \n4.2 \n%\nExpenses:\nProperty operating and maintenance\n259,037 \n242,228 \n16,809 \n6.9 \n%\nProperty management expense\n37,073 \n34,382 \n2,691 \n7.8 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n18,444 \n21,727 \n(3,283)\n(15.1)\n%\nInterest expense\n90,781 \n91,060 \n(279)\n(0.3)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n188,457 \n180,479 \n7,978 \n4.4 \n%\nCasualty losses, impairment, and other\n3,420 \n20,872 \n(17,452)\n(83.6)\n%\nTotal expenses\n597,212 \n590,748 \n6,464 \n1.1 \n%\nGains (losses) on investments in equity and other securities, net\n380 \n(257)\n637 \n247.9 \n%\nOther, net\n(1,769)\n(9,345)\n7,576 \n81.1 \n%\nGain on sale of property, net of tax\n45,515 \n47,766 \n(2,251)\n(4.7)\n%\nIncome (losses) from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n2,130 \n(12,160)\n14,290 \n117.5 \n%\nNet income\n$\n137,210 \n$\n95,578 \n$\n41,632 \n43.6 \n%\nRevenues\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, total revenues were $688.2 million and $660.3 million, respectively. Set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total revenues.\n48\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, total portfolio rental revenues and other property income totaled $666.2 million and $641.3 million, respectively, an increase of 3.9%, driven by an increase in average monthly rent per occupied home and a 1,263 home increase between periods in the average number of homes owned, partially offset by a 70 bps reduction in average occupancy.\nAverage occupancy for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 for the total portfolio was 94.8% and 95.5%, respectively. Average monthly rent per occupied home for the total portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $2,447 and $2,397, respectively, a 2.1% increase. For our Same Store portfolio, average occupancy was 96.5% and 97.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and average monthly rent per occupied home for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $2,461 and $2,401, respectively, a 2.5% increase.\nThe annualized turnover rate for the Same Store portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was 25.5% and 24.5%, respectively. \nFor the Same Store portfolio, an average home remained unoccupied for \n45\n and \n38\n days between residents for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \nThe increase in days to re-resident resulted in an overall decrease in average Same Store occupancy on a year over year basis.\nTo monitor prospective changes in average monthly rent per occupied home, we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home, in each case, net of any amortized non-service concessions, to calculate net effective rental rate growth. Leases are either renewal leases, where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term, or new leases, where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home.\nRenewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged \n4.5%\n and \n4.2%\n for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged \n(0.9)%\n and \n1.7%\n for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. For our Same Store portfolio, renewal lease net effective rental rate growth averaged \n4.5%\n and \n4.2%\n for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and new lease net effective rental rate growth averaged \n(0.6)%\n and \n1.6%\n for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOther property income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased compared to September 30, 2024, primarily due to enhanced value-add revenue programs and increased utility recoveries as new leases are entered into, among other things.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, management fee revenues totaled $22.0 million and $19.0 million, respectively. The 15.8% increase is primarily due to an increase in the average number of homes for which we provide property and asset management services from \n23,182 \nhomes for the three months ended September 30, 2024\n to 24,251 h\nomes for the three months ended September 30, 2025.\nExpenses\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, total expenses were $597.2 million and $590.7 million, respectively. Set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, property operating and maintenance expense increased to $259.0 million from $242.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. \nThe \n6.9% increase in property operating and maintenance expense is primarily attributable \nto a \n1,263\n home \nincrease in the average number of homes owned between periods, as well as increases in property taxes and utilities.\nProperty management expense and general and administrative expense decreased to $55.5 million from $56.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, primarily due to a $3.5 million decrease in share-based compensation expense driven by the departure of an executive, partially offset by an increase in personnel and other costs related to our property and asset management platform.\nInterest expense decreased slightly to $90.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $91.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. \nThe decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a\n decrease in the balance of gross debt outstanding, partially offset by a 13 bps increase in our weighted average interest rate, in each case, as of September 30, 2025 as compared to September 30, 2024.\n49\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $188.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $180.5 million for the \nthree months ended September 30, 2024\n due to an increase in cumulative capital expenditures and a \n1,263 home increase in the average number of homes owned \nduring the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the \nthree months ended September 30, 2024\n.\nCasualty losses, impairment, and other\n expenses were $3.4 million and $20.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. D\nuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $20.6 million of net casualty losses for repairs from storm activity in excess of amounts recoverable from insurance coverage and impairment losses of $0.3 million on our single-family residential properties, compared to \n$3.1 million\n and $0.3 million, respectively, for the \nthree months ended September 30, 2025.\nGains (Losses) on Investments in Equity and Other Securities, net\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, gains on investments in equity and other securities, net of $0.4 million was comprised of a realized gain during the quarter and net unrealized gains recognized on investments\n held as of \nSeptember 30, 2025. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, losses on investments in equity and other securities, net of $0.3 million was comprised \nof \na realized gain during the quarter\n and \nnet unrealized losses recognized on \ninvestments held at period end\n.\nOther, net\nOther, net decreased to $1.8 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $9.3 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to\n \nsettlement and other costs incurred in connection with the resolution of an inquiry from the \nFederal Trade Commission (the “\nFTC”) and the legal dispute entitled \nCity of San Diego et al v. Invitation Homes, Inc.\n that was settled during the third quarter of 2024. This reduction in expense is partially offset by a decrease in interest earnings on cash balances.\nGain on Sale of Property, net of tax\nGain on sale of property, net of tax was $45.5 million and $47.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. A decrease in the\n number of homes sold from 310 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 292 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was the primary driver of the decrease.\nIncome (Losses) from Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOur share of equity in income (losses) from unconsolidated joint ventures was a gain of \n$2.1 million for the \nthree months ended September 30, 2025, compared to a loss of \n$12.2 million for the \nthree months ended September 30, 2024. The change was primarily driven by an increase in our share of income and distributions from the FNMA joint venture from 10.0% to 50.0% as a result of achieving a promote interest threshold pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement and gains on dispositions of homes within that portfolio.\n50\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nFor the Nine Months\nEnded September 30,\n($ in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nRevenues:\nRental revenues and other property income\n$\n1,978,369 \n$\n1,910,914 \n$\n67,455 \n3.5 \n%\nManagement fee revenues\n65,677 \n48,898 \n16,779 \n34.3 \n%\nTotal revenues\n2,044,046 \n1,959,812 \n84,234 \n4.3 \n%\nExpenses:\nProperty operating and maintenance\n740,764 \n706,809 \n33,955 \n4.8 \n%\nProperty management expense\n109,645 \n98,252 \n11,393 \n11.6 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n71,553 \n66,673 \n4,880 \n7.3 \n%\nInterest expense\n262,449 \n270,912 \n(8,463)\n(3.1)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n557,058 \n532,414 \n24,644 \n4.6 \n%\nCasualty losses, impairment, and other\n11,132 \n35,362 \n(24,230)\n(68.5)\n%\nTotal expenses\n1,752,601 \n1,710,422 \n42,179 \n2.5 \n%\nGains (losses) on investments in equity and other securities, net\n69 \n1,038 \n(969)\n(93.4)\n%\nOther, net\n(2,537)\n(57,384)\n54,847 \n95.6 \n%\nGain on sale of property, net of tax\n163,772 \n141,531 \n22,241 \n15.7 \n%\nLosses from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n(7,890)\n(22,780)\n14,890 \n65.4 \n%\nNet income\n$\n444,859 \n$\n311,795 \n$\n133,064 \n42.7 \n%\nRevenues\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, total revenues were $2,044.0 million and $1,959.8 million, respectively. Set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total revenues.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, total portfolio rental revenues and other property income totaled $1,978.4 million and $1,910.9 million, respectively, an increase of 3.5%, driven by an increase in average monthly rent per occupied home and a 1,006 home increase between periods in the average number of homes owned, partially offset by a 100 bps reduction in average occupancy.\nAverage occupancy for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 for the total portfolio was 95.2% and 96.2%, respectively. Average monthly rent per occupied home for the total portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $2,435 and $2,379, respectively, a 2.4% increase. For our Same Store portfolio, average occupancy was 97.0% and 97.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and average monthly rent per occupied home for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $2,445 and $2,379, respectively, a 2.8% increase.\nThe annualized turnover rate for the Same Store portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was 23.2% and 23.5%, respectively. For the Same Store portfolio, a home remained unoccupied on average for 44 and 37 days between residents for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nTo monitor prospective changes in average monthly rent per occupied home, we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home, in each case, net of any amortized non-service concessions, to calculate net effective rental rate growth. Leases are either renewal leases, where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term, or new leases, where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home.\n51\nRenewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 4.7% and 5.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 0.3% and \n2.0%\n for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. For our Same Store portfolio, renewal lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 4.8% and 5.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and new lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 0.5% and 2.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOther property income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased compared to September 30, 2024, primarily due to enhanced value-add revenue programs and increased utility recoveries as new leases are entered into, among other things.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, management fee revenues totaled $65.7 million and $48.9 million, respectively. The 34.3% increase is primarily due to an increase in the average number of homes for which we provide property and asset management services from \n19,493\n homes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\n to 24,722\n homes for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. \nExpenses\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, total expenses were $1,752.6 million and $1,710.4 million, respectively. Set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, property operating and maintenance expense\n \nincreased\n to $740.8 million from $706.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The \n4.8% increase in property operating and maintenance expense is primarily attributable \nto a 1,006 home \nincrease in the average number of homes owned between periods, as well as increases in utilities and property taxes.\nProperty management expense and general and administrative expense increased\n to \n$181.2 million\n from \n$164.9 million\n for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs related to our property and asset management platform, including costs to manage a 26.8% increase in the average number of homes managed between periods.\nInterest expense decreased to $262.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from $270.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \nThe decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a\n decrease in the balance of gross debt outstanding, partially offset by a 13 bps increase in our weighted average interest rate, in each case, as of September 30, 2025 as compared to September 30, 2024. Additionally, the amendment of certain of our interest rate swap agreements during 2024 reduced related non-cash fair value amortization by $12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the \nnine months ended September 30, 2024\n.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased\n to $557.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from $532.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in cumulative capital expenditures and\n a 1,006 home increase in the average number of homes owned \nduring the\n nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the \nnine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCasualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were $11.1 million and $35.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \nD\nuring the \nnine months ended September 30, 2024\n, we incurred $35.1 million of net casualty losses for repairs from storm activity in excess of amounts recoverable from insurance coverage and impairment losses of $0.3 million on our single-family residential properties, compared to \n$10.7 million\n and $0.4 million, respectively, for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025.\nGains (Losses) on Investments in Equity and Other Securities, net\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, gains on investments in equity and other securities, net of $0.1 million was comprised of a realized gain and net unrealized losses recognized on investments\n held as of \nSeptember 30, 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gains on investments in equity and other securities, net of $1.0 million was comprised of a $1.6 million realized gain from exercised warrants, partially offset by $0.6 million of net unrealized losses recognized on investments held as of September 30, 2024.\n52\nOther, net\nOther, net decreased to $2.5 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from $57.4 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, \nprimarily due to\n \nsettlement and other costs incurred in connection with the resolution of an inquiry from the\n \nFTC and the legal dispute entitled \nCity of San Diego et al v. Invitation Homes, Inc.\n that was settled during the third quarter of 2024. This reduction in expense is partially offset by a decrease in interest earnings on cash balances.\nGain on Sale of Property, net of tax\nGain on sale of property, net of tax was $163.8 million and $141.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. An increase in the number of homes sold from 937 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 1,041 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was the primary driver of the increase.\nLosses from Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOur share of losses from unconsolidated joint ventures was $7.9 million and $22.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The change was primarily driven by an increase in our share of income and distributions from the FNMA joint venture from 10.0% to 50.0% as a result of achieving a promote interest threshold pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement and gains on dispositions of homes within that portfolio.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $155.4 million and $174.5 million, respectively, an 11.0% \ndecrease primarily \ndue to acquisitions of homes\n.\n As of September 30, 2025, $1,750.0 million of our Revolving Facility is undrawn, and there are no restrictions on our ability to draw funds thereunder provided we remain in compliance with all covenants. We have no debt reaching final maturity until June 2027.\nAmendment of 2022 Term Loan Facility\nOn April 28, 2025, we entered into an amendment to the 2022 Term Loan Facility that (1) amends the initial maturity date from June 22, 2029 to April 28, 2028, with two one year extension options at our election, provided we are in compliance with the loan agreement and pay a 12.5 bps extension fee and (2) adjusts the margin applicable to borrowings.\nPublic Offering\nOn August 15, 2025, in a public offering under our shelf registration statement, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.95% Senior Notes which mature on January 15, 2033.\nInterest Rate Swap Transactions\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, we entered into two new interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $400.0 million which became active on May 8, 2025 and June 20, 2025. As of September 30, 2025, our active swaps have a weighted average strike rate of 3.07%. \nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 28, 2025, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of $500.0 million. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program, if any, will be made at our discretion and are not required or guaranteed. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other liquidity needs and priorities. The Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date.\n53\nOther\nOur ability to access capital as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of general economic conditions, including inflation and interest rates, as detailed in Part I.

Item 1. “Financial Statements — Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.”\n(2)\nVariable interest rate loans are indexed to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) index rate determined by reference to a published forward-looking SOFR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing (“Term SOFR”), including any credit spread adjustments provided for in the terms of the underlying agreement (“Adjusted SOFR”), reflected as “S” in the table above.\n(3)\nWeighted average years to maturity assumes all extension options are exercised, which are subject to certain conditions being met.\n(4)\nIH 2017-1 bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.23% per annum, equal to the market determined pass-through rate payable on the certificates including applicable servicing fees.\n55\n(5)\nIH 2019-1 bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.59% per annum including applicable servicing fees for the first 11 years and for the twelfth year bears interest at a floating rate based on a spread of 147 bps over a comparable or successor rate to the one month London Interbank Offer Rate as provided for in the loan agreement, including applicable servicing fees, subject to certain adjustments as outlined in the loan agreement. \n(6)\nAs of September 30, 2025, interest rate is based on Term SOFR of 4.13% plus the applicable margin and a 0.10% credit spread adjustment for 2024 Term Loan and the Revolving Facility. \n(7)\nIf we exercise the two one year extension options, the maturity date for the 2022 Term Loan Facility will be April 28, 2030.\n(8)\nFor unsecured debt and total debt, the weighted average interest rate is calculated based on September 30, 2025 Term SOFR of 4.13% adjusted for a 0.10% credit spread adjustment (Adjusted SOFR), where appropriate, and includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements effective as of that date.\nAs part of our long-term debt strategy, our goal is to maintain or improve our credit ratings, and, over time, we generally intend to be a predominantly unsecured borrower with a target net debt of approximately 5.5 to 6.0 times trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n (see “— Non-GAAP Measures — EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n”). To facilitate our long-term debt strategy, we expect to seek to, among other things, (a) refinance a significant portion of our secured debt maturing in 2027 with unsecured debt, including potential unsecured bond issuances and/or (b) repay a portion of such debt. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our long-term debt strategy, improving our credit ratings, or adhering to our targets in the short or medium term or at all, or that we will not change our strategy or targets in the future. We may from time to time fall outside of our target ranges. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional unsecured debt financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. For further discussion of risks related to our indebtedness, see Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Indebtedness,” including “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Indebtedness — \nWe may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations\n” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShort-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Needs\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations, make dividend payments to our stockholders, and meet other general requirements of our business. Our liquidity, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of:\n•\nacquisition of homes currently under contract, including commitments to homebuilders;\n•\nrenovation of newly-acquired homes;\n•\nHOA fees (as applicable), property taxes, insurance premiums, and the ongoing maintenance of our homes;\n•\nproperty management, general and administrative, and other entity-level commitments and expenses;\n•\ninterest expense;\n•\ndividend payments to our stockholders; and\n•\nrequired contributions to our joint ventures.\nWe believe our rental income, net of total expenses, will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund operations and dividend payments on a short-term basis. Additionally, we have guaranteed the funding of certain tax, insurance, and non-conforming property reserves related to the financing of one of our joint ventures. We do not expect these guarantees to have a material current or future effect on our liquidity. See Part I. Item 1. “Financial Statements — Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nGeneral economic conditions in the United States have fluctuated in recent quarters, and concerns persist regarding adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, elevated interest rates, political dissension, and labor shortfalls. Fluctuating economic conditions and uncertainty in financial markets may negatively impact our operating cash flow such that we are unable to make required debt service payments, which would result in an event of default for any debt instrument under whose loan agreement such payments were not made. Specifically, the collateral within individual borrower entities may underperform, resulting in cash flow shortfalls for debt service while consolidated cash flows are sufficient to fund our operations. If an event of default occurs for our secured debt, our loan agreements provide certain remedies, including our \n56\nability to fund shortfalls from consolidated cash flow; and such an event of default would not result in an immediate acceleration of the loan.\nOur real estate assets are illiquid in nature. A timely liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of short-term liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise, and we may need to source liquidity from other financing sources, such as the Revolving Facility which had an undrawn balance of $1,750.0 million as of September 30, 2025.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of, and non-recurring capital expenditures for, our homes and principal and interest payments of our indebtedness. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt and equity securities, and property dispositions. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. Therefore, as a general matter, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances from our annual taxable income that could be used to meet our liquidity needs. Instead, we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts, if any, by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income.\nCash Flows\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024: \nFor the Nine Months\nEnded September 30,\n($ in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,077,580 \n$\n948,997 \n$\n128,583 \n13.5 \n%\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(570,993)\n(492,697)\n(78,296)\n(15.9)\n%\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(530,612)\n(108,312)\n(422,300)\n(389.9)\n%\nChange in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n(24,025)\n$\n347,988 \n$\n(372,013)\n(106.9)\n%\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy level of our homes, the rental rates achieved on our leases, the collection of rent from our residents, and the amount of our operating and other expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,077.6 million and $949.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively\n, an increase of 13.5%. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to improved operational profitability, including an \n$84.2 million increase in total revenues, and the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities from period to period.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities consists primarily of the acquisition costs of homes, capital improvements, proceeds from property sales, and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Net cash used in investing activities was $571.0 million and $492.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, an\n increase of $78.3 million. The net increase in cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the combined effect of the following significant changes in cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024: \n(1) an \nincrease in cash used for the acquisition of homes; \n(2) an increase in cash proceeds received from the sale of single-family homes; and\n (3) an increase in cash used for other investing activities\n. Acquisition spend increased by $137.8 million from period to period due to an increase in the number of homes acquired from 1,591 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 2,042 homes acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Proceeds from the sale of single-family homes increased $68.0 million due to an increase in the number of homes sold from 937 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 1,041 homes sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, partially offset by a decrease in average net proceeds per home. Cash used in other investing activities increased $22.3 million from period to period primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures to repair hurricane damage to homes from late 2024 storms. \n57\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $530.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $108.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change between periods is primarily due to the following financing transactions.\n During the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025, w\ne issued \n$596.9 million of unsecured notes, net of discount, and used the proceeds to repay the then-outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility (resulting in $570.0 million of\n net payments thereon on a year to date basis).\n During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued $494.3 million of unsecured notes, net of discount, and entered into a replacement credit facility. The proceeds from this refinancing were used to repay the existing credit facility, fund $54.3 million of financing costs, and increase cash reserves for general corporate purposes. \nW\ne also made dividend and distribution payments totaling \n$536.8 million\n during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $518.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were funded by cash flows from operations.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of September 30, 2025, consist of the following: \n($ in thousands)\nTotal\n2025\n(1)\n2026-2027\n2028-2029\nThereafter\nSecured Debt\n(2)(3)\n$\n1,540,689 \n$\n14,036 \n$\n1,076,836 \n$\n28,769 \n$\n421,048 \nUnsecured Notes\n(2)(3)\n5,598,291 \n42,203 \n337,620 \n1,066,629 \n4,151,839 \nTerm Loan Facilities\n(2)(3)(4)(5)\n2,998,105 \n31,941 \n253,442 \n1,975,889 \n736,833 \nRevolving Facility\n(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)\n10,500 \n671 \n5,323 \n4,506 \n— \nDerivative instruments\n(2)(7)\n(65,896)\n(5,703)\n(45,252)\n(14,941)\n— \nPurchase commitments\n(8)\n285,500 \n81,079 \n204,421 \n— \n— \nOperating leases\n47,783 \n1,299 \n10,750 \n9,595 \n26,139 \nFinance leases\n11,056 \n1,048 \n7,715 \n2,293 \n— \nTotal\n$\n10,426,028 \n$\n166,574 \n$\n1,850,855 \n$\n3,072,740 \n$\n5,335,859 \n(1)\nIncludes estimated payments for the remaining three months of 2025.\n(2)\nFor detailed information about each of our financing arrangements and derivative instruments see Part I.

As of September 30, 2025, Term SOFR was 4.13%.\n(8)\nRepresents commitments, net of previously funded deposits, to acquire 984 homes, including commitments totaling $260.0 million to acquire 904 homes pursuant to binding purchase agreements with certain homebuilders as of September 30, 2025.\nAdditionally, we have commitments, which are not reflected in the table above, to make additional capital contributions to our joint ventures. As of September 30, 2025, our remaining equity commitments to our joint ventures total $143.7 million.\n58\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\nIn March 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and created Rule 13-01 to simplify disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities. The amendments became effective on January 4, 2021. INVH, INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub, LLC (“IH Merger Sub”) have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering, among other securities, debt securities of INVH LP, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by INVH, the General Partner, and/or IH Merger Sub. As a result of the amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company’s consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is “full and unconditional” and, subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub have not been presented.\nFurthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub, because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of INVH, INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors.\nPurchase of Outstanding Debt Securities or Loans\nAs market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt or debt securities that we may issue in the future, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our condensed consolidated balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our Credit Facility. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for United States federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that our critical accounting policies pertain to our investments in single-family residential properties, including acquisition of real estate assets, related cost capitalization, provisions for impairment, and single-family residential properties held for sale. These critical policies and estimates are summarized in Part II. Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nFor a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards, if any, see Part I. Item 1. “Financial Statements — Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nSegment Reporting \nOur principal business is acquiring, renovating, leasing, operating, and managing single-family residential properties. Under the provisions of ASC 280, \nSegment Reporting\n, we have determined that we currently operate in one reportable segment.\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). We concluded that we have one reportable segment based on the way our CODM regularly reviews internally reported financial information to evaluate performance, make operating decisions, and allocate resources at a consolidated level. Net income as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of operations is a primary metric utilized by the CODM to analyze the performance of the segment, including budget versus actual performance, and to allocate resources.\n59\nNon-GAAP Measures \nEBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre \nEBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n are supplemental, non-GAAP measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. We define EBITDA as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before the following items: interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) recommends as a best practice that REITs that report an EBITDA performance measure also report EBITDA\nre\n. Consistent with the Nareit definition, we define EBITDA\nre\n as EBITDA, further adjusted for the following: gain on sale of property, net of tax; and impairment on depreciated real estate investments. Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is defined as EBITDA\nre\n before the following items: share-based compensation expense; severance; casualty (gains) losses and reserves, net; (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, net; and other income and expenses. Where appropriate, EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA are adjusted for our share of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nEBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks. Set forth below is additional detail on how management uses EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n as measures of performance.\nOur management uses EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n in a number of ways to assess our condensed consolidated financial and operating performance, and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in identifying trends in our performance. EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance, while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results. Accordingly, we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely our cost structure and expenses.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is net income or loss. EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n may not be comparable to the EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.\n60\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months \nEnded September 30,\nFor the Nine Months \nEnded September 30,\n($ in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n136,474 \n$\n95,084 \n$\n442,656 \n$\n215,139 \n$\n310,223 \nNet income available to participating securities\n264 \n185 \n714 \n584 \nNon-controlling interests\n472 \n309 \n1,489 \n988 \nInterest expense\n90,781 \n91,060 \n262,449 \n270,912 \nInterest expense in unconsolidated joint ventures\n7,253 \n10,186 \n18,822 \n20,970 \nDepreciation and amortization\n188,457 \n180,479 \n557,058 \n532,414 \nDepreciation and amortization of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n4,484 \n3,590 \n11,937 \n9,875 \nEBITDA\n428,185 \n380,893 \n1,295,125 \n1,145,966 \nGain on sale of property, net of tax\n(45,515)\n(47,766)\n(163,772)\n(141,531)\nImpairment on depreciated real estate investments\n335 \n270 \n434 \n330 \nNet (gain) loss on sale of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n(6,469)\n499 \n(6,875)\n285 \nEBITDA\nre\n376,536 \n333,896 \n1,124,912 \n1,005,050 \nShare-based compensation expense\n(1)\n1,916 \n5,417 \n20,537 \n20,809 \nSeverance expense\n— \n209 \n2,420 \n388 \nCasualty losses and reserves, net\n(2)\n3,116 \n20,729 \n10,799 \n35,174 \n(Gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net\n(380)\n257 \n(69)\n(1,038)\nOther, net\n(3)\n1,769 \n9,345 \n2,537 \n57,384 \nAdjusted EBITDA\nre\n$\n382,957 \n$\n369,853 \n$\n1,161,136 \n$\n1,117,767 \n(1)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, $1,562 and $1,313 was recorded in property management expense, respectively, and $354 and $4,104 was recorded in general and administrative expense, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, $4,779 and $4,585 was recorded in property management expense, respectively, and $15,758 and $16,224, was recorded in general and administrative expense, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures.

We define NOI for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense (which consists primarily of property taxes, insurance, HOA fees (when applicable), market-level personnel expenses, utility expenses, repairs and maintenance, and property administration). NOI excludes: interest expense; depreciation and amortization; property management expense; general and administrative expense; casualty losses, impairment, and other; gain on sale of property, net of tax; (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, net; other income and expenses; management fee revenues; and (income) losses from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe consider NOI to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe NOI is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to NOI is net income or loss. NOI is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our NOI may not be comparable to the NOI of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of NOI. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measure is comparable with that of other companies.\n61\nWe believe that Same Store NOI is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as NOI and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting NOI for homes in our Same Store portfolio.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) to NOI for our total portfolio and NOI for our Same Store portfolio for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months\nEnded September 30,\nFor the Nine Months \nEnded September 30,\n($ in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n136,474 \n$\n95,084 \n$\n442,656 \n$\n310,223 \nNet income available to participating securities\n264 \n185 \n714 \n584 \nNon-controlling interests\n472 \n309 \n1,489 \n988 \nInterest expense\n90,781 \n91,060 \n262,449 \n270,912 \nDepreciation and amortization\n188,457 \n180,479 \n557,058 \n532,414 \nProperty management expense\n(1)\n37,073 \n34,382 \n109,645 \n98,252 \nGeneral and administrative\n(2)\n18,444 \n21,727 \n71,553 \n66,673 \nCasualty losses, impairment, and other\n(3)\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3,420 \n20,872 \n11,132 \n35,362 \nGain on sale of property, net of tax\n(45,515)\n(47,766)\n(163,772)\n(141,531)\n(Gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net\n(380)\n257 \n(69)\n(1,038)\nOther, net\n(4)\n1,769 \n9,345 \n2,537 \n57,384 \nManagement fee revenues\n(21,975)\n(18,980)\n(65,677)\n(48,898)\n(Income) losses from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n(2,130)\n12,160 \n7,890 \n22,780 \nNOI (total portfolio)\n407,154 \n399,114 \n1,237,605 \n1,204,105 \nNon-Same Store NOI\n(27,285)\n(23,369)\n(77,107)\n(74,001)\nNOI (Same Store portfolio)\n(5)\n$\n379,869 \n$\n375,745 \n$\n1,160,498 \n$\n1,130,104 \n(1)\nIncludes $1,562 and $1,313 of share-based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

FFO is defined by Nareit as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus depreciation, amortization and impairment of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe believe that FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization. Because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management considers FFO an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciated real estate investments, gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes, as well non-controlling interests, from net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP). By excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate, management uses FFO to measure returns on its investments in homes. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes, all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited.\nManagement also believes that FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FFO is net income or loss. FFO is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our FFO may not be comparable to the FFO of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of FFO. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.\nWe believe that Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as FFO and are further helpful to investors as they provide a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period. We define Core FFO as FFO adjusted for the following (including adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures, as applicable): non-cash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs, loan discounts, and non-cash interest expense from derivatives; share-based compensation expense; legal settlements; severance expense; casualty (gains) losses and reserves, net; and (gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net, as applicable. We define Adjusted FFO as Core FFO less recurring capital expenditures, including adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures, that are necessary to help preserve the value, and maintain the functionality, of our homes. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Core FFO and Adjusted FFO is net income or loss. Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our Core FFO and Adjusted FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO and Adjusted FFO of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of Core FFO and Adjusted FFO. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.\n63\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) to FFO, Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO for each of the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months\nEnded September 30,\nFor the Nine Months \nEnded September 30,\n(in thousands, except shares and per share data)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n136,474 \n$\n95,084 \n$\n442,656 \n$\n310,223 \nAdd (deduct) adjustments from net income to derive FFO:\nNet income available to participating securities\n264 \n185 \n714 \n584 \nNon-controlling interests\n472 \n309 \n1,489 \n988 \nDepreciation and amortization on real estate assets\n183,653 \n176,174 \n543,775 \n521,411 \nImpairment on depreciated real estate investments\n335 \n270 \n434 \n330 \nNet gain on sale of previously depreciated investments in real estate\n(45,515)\n(47,766)\n(163,772)\n(141,531)\nDepreciation and net gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures\n(1,992)\n4,060 \n5,016 \n10,076 \nFFO\n273,691 \n228,316 \n830,312 \n702,081 \nNon-cash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs, loan discounts, and non-cash interest expense from derivatives\n(1)\n9,128 \n14,085 \n18,486 \n32,207 \nShare-based compensation expense\n(2)\n1,916 \n5,417 \n20,537 \n20,809 \nLegal settlements\n(3)\n— \n17,500 \n— \n77,000 \nSeverance expense\n— \n209 \n2,420 \n388 \nCasualty losses and reserves, net\n(1)(4)\n3,116 \n20,729 \n10,799 \n35,174 \n(Gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net\n(380)\n257 \n(69)\n(1,038)\nCore FFO\n287,471 \n286,513 \n882,485 \n866,621 \nRecurring capital expenditures\n(1)\n(52,350)\n(51,505)\n(132,969)\n(135,262)\nAdjusted FFO\n$\n235,121 \n$\n235,008 \n$\n749,516 \n$\n731,359 \nNet income available to common stockholders\nWeighted average common shares outstanding — diluted\n(5)(6)\n613,084,571 \n613,645,188 \n613,237,288 \n613,759,171 \nNet income per common share — diluted\n(5)(6)\n$\n0.22 \n$\n0.15 \n$\n0.72 \n$\n0.51 \nFFO, Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO\nWeighted average common shares and OP Units outstanding — diluted\n(5)(6)\n615,599,540 \n615,913,139 \n615,673,797 \n615,987,978 \nFFO per common share — diluted\n(5)(6)\n$\n0.44 \n$\n0.37 \n$\n1.35 \n$\n1.14 \nCore FFO per common share — diluted\n(5)(6)\n$\n0.47 \n$\n0.47 \n$\n1.43 \n$\n1.41 \nAFFO per common share — diluted\n(5)(6)\n$\n0.38 \n$\n0.38 \n$\n1.22 \n$\n1.19 \n(1)\nIncludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures.\n(2)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, $1,562 and $1,313 was recorded in property management expense, respectively, and $354 and $4,104 was recorded in general and administrative expense, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, $4,779 and $4,585, was recorded in property management expense, respectively, and $15,758 and $16,224 was recorded in general and administrative expense, respectively.\n(3)\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, included $17,500 and $77,000, respectively, of settlement costs that resolved an inquiry from the FTC and the legal dispute entitled \nCity of San Diego et al v.

For the computations of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO per common share — diluted, common share equivalents of 415,032 and 1,259,328 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 644,075 and 1,533,792 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, related to incremental shares attributed to non-vested share-based awards are included in the denominator.\n(6)\nVested units of partnership interests in INVH LP (“OP Units”) have been excluded from the computation of net income per common share — diluted for the periods above because all net income attributable to the vested OP Units has been recorded as non-controlling interest and thus excluded from net income available to common stockholders. Weighted average vested OP Units of 2,099,937 and 1,979,009 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 2,058,429 and 1,945,886 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, are included in the denominator for the computations of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO per common share — diluted."
