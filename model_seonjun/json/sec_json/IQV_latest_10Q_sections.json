Technology & Analytics Solutions provides mission critical information, technology solutions and real world insights and services to our life science clients. Research & Development Solutions, which primarily serves biopharmaceutical customers, provides outsourced clinical research and clinical trial related services. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions provides health care provider (including contract sales) and patient engagement services to both biopharmaceutical clients and the broader healthcare market.\nSources of Revenue\nTotal revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services. We do not have any material product revenues.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our cost of revenues including reimbursed expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of revenues includes compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production, trial monitoring, data management and delivery, and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings; costs of staff directly involved with delivering technology-related services offerings and engagements, related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements; and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees, laboratory supplies, professional services and travel expenses. Reimbursed expenses, which are included in cost of revenues, are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales, marketing and administrative functions (including human resources, legal, finance, quality assurance, compliance and general management) for compensation and benefits, travel, professional services, training and expenses for information technology and facilities. We also incur costs and expenses associated with depreciation and amortization.\n25\nTable of contents\nForeign Currency Translation \nIn the first nine months of 2025, approximately 30% of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which represents approximately 60 currencies. Because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and our financial statements are reported in United States dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into United States dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into United States dollars for purposes of reporting our condensed consolidated results. As a result, we believe that reporting results of operations that exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period to period comparisons. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results. As such, the differences noted below between reported results of operations and constant currency information are wholly attributable to the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nConsolidated Results of Operations \nFor information regarding our results of operations for Technology & Analytics Solutions, Research & Development Solutions and Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, refer to “Segment Results of Operations” later in this section.\nRevenues\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nRevenues\n$\n4,100 \n$\n3,896 \n$\n204 \n5.2 \n%\nFor the third quarter of 2025, our revenues increased $204 million, or 5.2%, as compared to the same period in 2024.

These restructuring actions are expected to occur throughout 2025 and into 2026 and are expected to consist of consolidating functional activities, eliminating redundant positions and aligning resources with customer requirements.\nInterest Income and Interest Expense\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nInterest income\n$\n(13)\n$\n(13)\n$\n(34)\n$\n(36)\nInterest expense\n$\n189 \n$\n170 \n$\n536 \n$\n499 \nInterest income includes interest received primarily from bank balances and investments. Interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2025 remained consistent as compared to the same period in 2024, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 decreased compared to the same period in 2024 primarily as a result of lower interest rates. \nInterest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased compared to the same periods in 2024 as a result of higher outstanding debt balances.\n27\nTable of contents\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOther (income) expense, net\n$\n(31)\n$\n44 \n$\n(5)\n$\n(12)\nOther (income) expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to foreign currency gain on transactions.\nOther (income) expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 decreased compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to less revaluations of contingent consideration arrangements and adjustments in investment balances, offset by less foreign currency loss on transactions.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIncome tax expense \n$\n76 \n$\n65 \n$\n193 \n$\n189 \nOur effective income tax rate was 18.6% and 18.6% in the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 18.3% and 16.8% in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024 was favorably impacted due to changes in the geographical mix of earnings amongst the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2024 was also favorably impacted by $2 million and $14 million, respectively, as a result of excess tax benefits recognized upon settlement of share-based compensation awards. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2025 was unfavorably impacted by $0 million and $3 million, respectively, of tax expense recognized upon settlement of share-based compensation awards. \nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. government enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\"), which includes several changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including the temporary and permanent extension, of expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The impacts of the OBBBA are not expected to be material to the 2025 consolidated financial statements, however we will continue to evaluate impacts to future periods.\nOn December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% on companies with revenues of at least €750 million, which went into effect in 2024. We have continued to evaluate the effect of this through the third quarter of 2025 and determined that it did not have any material impacts for the current year. We will continue to assess the impact of this proposal as countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD's proposal.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates\n$\n— \n$\n1 \n$\n(14)\n$\n— \nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, decreased compared to the same periods in 2024, due to the results in the operations of our unconsolidated affiliates.\n28\nTable of contents\nSegment Results of Operations\nRevenues and profit by segment are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nSegment Revenues\nSegment Profit\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions\n$\n1,631 \n$\n1,554 \n$\n370 \n$\n405 \nResearch & Development Solutions\n2,260 \n2,162 \n496 \n498 \nContract Sales & Medical Solutions\n209 \n180 \n13 \n12 \nTotal\n4,100 \n3,896 \n879 \n915 \nGeneral corporate and unallocated expenses\n(20)\n(59)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(286)\n(278)\nRestructuring costs\n(20)\n(28)\nConsolidated\n$\n4,100 \n$\n3,896 \n$\n553 \n$\n550 \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nSegment Revenues\nSegment Profit\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions\n$\n4,805 \n$\n4,502 \n$\n1,119 \n$\n1,101 \nResearch & Development Solutions\n6,563 \n6,404 \n1,407 \n1,470 \nContract Sales & Medical Solutions\n578 \n541 \n36 \n34 \nTotal\n11,946 \n11,447 \n2,562 \n2,605 \nGeneral corporate and unallocated expenses\n(99)\n(147)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(827)\n(811)\nRestructuring costs\n(81)\n(71)\nConsolidated\n$\n11,946 \n$\n11,447 \n$\n1,555 \n$\n1,576 \nCertain\n costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses.

Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements, equity repurchases, adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities, and access to the capital markets. \nWe manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost-effective basis. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. We have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the United States and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so.\nWe had a cash balance of $1,814 million as of September 30, 2025 ($656 million of which was in the United States), an increase from $1,702 million as of December 31, 2024.\nBased on our current operating plan, we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. We regularly evaluate our debt arrangements, as well as market conditions, and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates. We may use our existing cash, cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses and/or proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations, to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also continually evaluate new acquisition, expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities, as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses, as appropriate, including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets. Should we elect to pursue any such transaction, we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities. Our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all.\nEquity Repurchase Program\nOn February 5, 2025, our Board of Directors increased the stock repurchase authorization under our equity repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\") with respect to the repurchase of our common stock by an additional $2,000 million, which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the Repurchase Program to $13,725 million. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time.\n33\nTable of contents\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 6.4 million shares of our common stock for $1,032 million under the Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2025, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1,981 million of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. In addition, from time to time, we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the Repurchase Program. \nDebt\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $15,034 million of total indebtedness, excluding $1,995 million of additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our long-term debt arrangements contain customary restrictive covenants and, as of September 30, 2025, we believe we were in compliance with our restrictive covenants in all material respects. \nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nOn March 10, 2025, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Amendment, among other changes, established a new incremental Term B-5 dollar loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $1,985 million (the “Incremental Term B-5 Dollar Facility”). Proceeds of the Incremental Term B-5 Dollar Facility were applied to refinance our existing Term B-4 dollar loans and repay in full our existing Term B-2 Euro loans. In connection with this Amendment, we recognized a $4 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which includes fees and related expenses.\nAs of September 30, 2025, our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provided financing through the senior secured credit facilities of up to $6,448 million, which consisted of $4,453 million principal amounts of debt outstanding, and $1,995 million of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility and standby letters of credit. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding our credit arrangements.\nSenior Notes\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company's Euro denominated 2.875% Senior Notes due 2025 matured and were repaid. \nOn June 4, 2025, we completed the issuance and sale of $2,000 million in gross proceeds of 6.250% senior notes due 2032 (the \"Senior Notes\"). The net proceeds from the notes offering were used to repay existing borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the Senior Notes offering, with any excess proceeds used for general corporate purposes. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding our credit arrangements.\nReceivables Financing Facility\n \nAs of September 30, 2025, no additional amounts of revolving loans were available under the receivables financing facility.\n34\nTable of contents\nNine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 \nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,919 \n$\n1,831 \nCash provided by operating activities increased $88 million during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.
