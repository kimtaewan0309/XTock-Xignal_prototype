  "item1": "Item 1.  Business\nCSX Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations. CSX and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the long-term economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. In addition, freight railroads provide the most economical and environmentally efficient means to transport goods over land. \nCSX Transportation, Inc.\nCSX’s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 20,000 route-mile rail network and serves major population centers in 26 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. This access allows the Company to meet the dynamic transportation needs of manufacturers, industrial producers, the automotive industry, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers, and energy producers. The Company’s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections with other Class I railroads and more than 240 short-line and regional railroads. On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (“Pan Am”), which is the parent company of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This acquisition expanded CSXT’s reach in the Northeastern United States. For further details, refer to Note 17, \nBusiness Combinations.\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities. Substantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations.\nOther Entities\nIn addition to CSXT, the Company’s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers, Inc. (\"Quality Carriers\"), CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (“CSX Intermodal Terminals”), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (“TDSI”), TRANSFLO Terminal Services, Inc. (“TRANSFLO”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries. Quality Carriers is the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals truck transportation in North America. CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States, and also provides drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations. TRANSFLO connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks. The biggest TRANSFLO markets are chemicals and agriculture, which includes shipments of plastics and ethanol. CSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.\nOperating Model\nThe Company is focused on developing and strictly maintaining a scheduled service plan with an emphasis on improving customer service, optimizing assets and increasing employee engagement. When this operating model is executed effectively, the Company competes for an increased share of the U.S. freight market. Further, this model leads to reduced costs and strong free cash flow generation. \nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.3\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nLines of Business\nDuring 2024, the Company's services generated $14.5 billion of revenue and served four primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal, coal and trucking.\n•\nThe merchandise business shipped 2.6 million\n \ncarloads (42% of volume) and generated $8.9 billion in revenue (61% of revenue) in 2024. The Company’s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets: chemicals, agricultural and food products, automotive, minerals, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers.\n•\nThe intermodal business shipped 2.9 million units (46% of volume) and generated $2.0 billion in revenue (14% of revenue) in 2024. The intermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of trucks and offers a cost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30 terminals, the intermodal business serves all major markets east of the Mississippi River and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.\n•\nThe coal business shipped 736 thousand carloads (12% of volume) and generated $2.2 billion in revenue (15% of revenue) in 2024. The Company transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and industrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Most of the export coal the Company transports is used for steelmaking, while the majority of domestic coal the Company ships is used for electricity generation.\n•\nThe trucking business generated $844 million, or 6%, of revenue in 2024. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers.\nOther revenue accounted for 4% of the Company’s total revenue in 2024. This category includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue from regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad. \nCSX's Committed Workforce\nMost of the Company’s employees provide or support transportation services. The Company had more than 23,500 employees as of December 2024, which includes approximately 17,500 employees that are members of a rail labor union. There are 12 rail unions at CSX that participate in national bargaining. As of December 2, 2022, all of these rail unions were covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that remained in effect through December 31, 2024. Collective agreements under the Railway Labor Act do not expire, but continue until amended. Prior to the 2022 agreements becoming amendable, CSX worked with several major rail unions on new five-year labor agreements. As of the date of this filing, new labor agreements have been fully ratified by seven unions representing approximately 40% of the Company's unionized workforce.\nCSX prioritizes workplace safety for employees and is committed to continued improvement through enhanced processes, training, technology, communication, and continuous collaboration with customers and peers across the railroad industry. Training programs and processes are focused on injury and accident prevention as well as emergency preparedness. Additionally, the attainment of key safety targets is a component of management's annual incentive program. The FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index, a measure of the number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours, was 1.19 in 2024 and 0.94 in 2023.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.4\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nThe Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with oversight of CSX's workforce. The Company is committed to developing a culture that promotes workforce diversity and inclusion and encourages ethical behavior. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 22% of CSX's overall workforce and 35% of management was diverse, calculated as the percentage of males of color and all females. In 2024, CSX was recognized as a “Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion” by Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities for a sixth consecutive year after receiving a top score on their disability equality index. The CSX Code of Ethics serves as a guiding standard for ethical behavior and covers many types of matters, including discrimination and harassment as well as safety. Annually, all management employees are required, and union employees are highly encouraged, to complete ethics training.\nCompany History\nA leader in freight rail transportation for nearly 200 years, the Company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”), the nation’s first common carrier, was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation. Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.\nCSX Corporation was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc. (\"Conrail\") allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the Southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network, which now includes the network acquired from Pan Am, allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.\nCompetition\nThe business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. \nCSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.5\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nRegulatory Environment\nThe Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the United States and Canada. In the U.S., the railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the Company's properties and operations. \nThe Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications. In Canada, the railroad operations conducted by the Company’s subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency.\nAlthough the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated the U.S. rail industry, the STB has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers. The STB regulates routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, rates for non-exempt traffic, acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, among other railroad activities. Any new rules from the STB regarding, among other things, competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. For further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n.\nFinancial Information\nInformation regarding the Company's results of operations and financial position can be found in Item 7. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther Information\nCSX makes available on its website \nwww.csx.com\n, free of charge, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company has posted its code of ethics on its website, which is also available to any shareholder who requests it. This Form 10-K and other SEC filings made by CSX are also accessible through the SEC’s website at \nwww.sec.gov\n.\n \nCSX has included the certifications of its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“the Act”) as Exhibit 31, as well as Section 906 of the Act as Exhibit 32 to this Form 10-K report.\n  \nFor additional information concerning business conducted by the Company during 2024, see Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.6\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I",

These decreases were partially offset by pricing gains in merchandise as well as higher merchandise and intermodal volumes.\nMerchandise Volume\nChemicals\n - Increased due to higher shipments of plastics, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and other industrial chemicals.\nAgricultural and Food Products\n – Decreased due to lower shipments of food and consumer products, as well as wheat and export grains, partially offset by higher shipments of domestic feed grain and its ingredients, and ethanol.\nAutomotive\n - Increased due to new business wins, which were partially offset by lower North American vehicle production.\nMinerals\n - Increased due to higher shipments of cement, partially offset by lower shipments of aggregates.\nForest Products\n – Increased due to higher shipments of pulpboard, paper, and building products.\nMetals and Equipment\n - Decreased primarily due to lower steel and scrap shipments.\nFertilizers\n - Decreased primarily due to declines in short-haul phosphates shipments.\nIntermodal Volume\nIntermodal volume increased primarily due to international shipments driven by higher imports through east coast ports and inventory replenishments. Domestic shipments also increased due to growth with key customers despite a soft trucking environment.\nCoal Volume\nExport coal increased due to higher shipments of metallurgical and thermal coal. Domestic coal decreased primarily due to lower shipments of coal to utility plants, as well as lower shipments to river and lake terminals.\nTrucking Revenue\nTrucking revenue decreased $38 million versus the prior year due to lower fuel and capacity surcharges.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue was $79 million lower, primarily resulting from lower carload demurrage and other items.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.30\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nExpense\nIn 2024, total expenses increased $137 million, or 1%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. \n \nLabor and Fringe\n expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $113 million due to the following items:\n•\nAn increase of $96 million was driven by inflation.\n•\nAn increase of $62 million was due to the impacts of higher headcount and union employee vacation and sick benefits.\n•\nIncentive compensation costs decreased $46 million primarily due to lower expected payouts.\n•\nNet other costs increased by $1 million due to non-significant items.\nPurchased Services and Other\n \nexpenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total purchased services and other expenses increased $50 million driven by the following:\n•\nAn increase of $17 million was due to impairments of technology and non-rail equipment, partially offset by prior year inventory adjustments.\n•\nAn increase of $17 million was due to higher operating support costs, which were primarily due to inflation and higher intermodal volumes. These increases were partially offset by efficiency savings.\n•\nAll other costs increased $16 million as a result of $37 million lower insurance recoveries, other inflation impacts, and non-significant increases, which were partially offset by a $20 million favorable legal settlement and other cost savings.\nDepreciation\n expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $51 million primarily due to a larger net asset base.\nFuel\n expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $209 million primarily due to a 13% decrease in locomotive fuel prices and improved efficiency.\nEquipment and Other Rents\n expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $1 million primarily due to increased net car hire costs offset by other non-significant items.\nGoodwill Impairment\n expense for Quality Carriers was $108 million for 2024. \nGains on Property Dispositions\n decreased to $11 million in 2024 from $34 million in 2023.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.31\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nInterest Expense\nInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt and related fair value hedges, equipment obligations and finance leases. Interest expense increased $23 million primarily as a result of higher average debt balances.\nOther Income - Net\nOther Income - Net includes investment gains, losses, interest income, components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income increased $3 million primarily due to increases in net pension benefit credits partially offset by lower income related to customer finance charges and a decrease in investment gains.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome Tax Expense decreased $76 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes.\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Diluted Share\nNet Earnings decreased $198 million to $3.5 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.03 to $1.79, due to the factors mentioned above. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.32\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nNON-GAAP MEASURES \n(Unaudited)\nCSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.\nAdjusted Operating Results\nManagement believes that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted net earnings per share, assuming dilution are important in evaluating the Company's performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude the fourth quarter 2024 non-cash impairment of Quality Carriers' goodwill, which is a significant item that is not considered indicative of future financial trends. The goodwill impairment was tax effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts related to the impairment charge. These adjusted results should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP operating results. \nThe following tables reconcile the Company's GAAP operating results for the year ended December 31, 2024 to adjusted operating results (non-GAAP measures).\nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOperating Income\nOperating Margin\nNet Earnings\nNet Earnings Per Share, Assuming Dilution\nGAAP Operating Results\n$\n5,245\n \n36.1\n \n%\n$\n3,470\n \n$\n1.79\n \nGoodwill Impairment\n108 \n0.7 \n82 \n0.04 \nAdjusted Operating Results (non-GAAP)\n$\n5,353 \n36.8 \n%\n$\n3,552 \n$\n1.83 \nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.33\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nEconomic Profit\nManagement believes Economic Profit (also referred to as CSX Cash Earnings or CCE) provides an additional perspective to investors about financial returns generated by the business by representing a measure showing profit generated over and above the cost of capital used by the business to generate that profit. Economic Profit is designed to incentivize strategic investments that earn more than management’s desired minimum required return and is broadly utilized by management to make investment decisions. Therefore, disclosing Economic Profit on how management performs in this regard provides additional useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance compared to its goals.\nEconomic Profit should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, operating income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic Profit is defined by the Company as Gross Cash Earnings (“GCE”) minus the Capital Charge on Gross Operating Assets (“GOA”). Increases in Economic Profit indicate that the Company is effectively allocating capital and rewarding shareholders by generating returns in excess of the incremental cost of capital associated with reinvestment in the business.\nGCE is calculated as operating income plus depreciation, amortization and operating lease expense, less unusual items and taxes. The Capital Charge uses a minimum required return multiplied by the GOA. CSX's GOAs include gross properties and other non-cash assets, net of non-interest bearing liabilities. The Company used a 15% tax rate and an 8% required return, for both periods presented, which is consistent with rates used for investment decisions and performance evaluation within those same periods. The tax rate is the approximate equivalent of the Company’s actual income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax GCE. The required return rate represents management’s desired minimum return on any investment. CSX annually re-evaluates these rates to ensure they accurately represent taxes and a required return in light of internal and external factors and would adjust the rate if the annual review resulted in a preset deviation from the current rates. This focuses the Economic Profit measure on value generated by management instead of external factors, such as legislative tax policy or interest rate volatility. \nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.34\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nThe following table reconciles operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to Economic Profit (non-GAAP measure).\nYears Ended\n(Dollars in Millions)\n2024 \n(a)\n2023\n (a)\nOperating Income\n$\n5,245\n \n$\n5,499\n \nAdd: Depreciation, Amortization, and Operating Lease Expense\n1,775 \n1,716 \nRemove: Unusual Items \n(b)\n108 \n— \nTaxes \n(c)\n(1,069)\n(1,082)\nGross Cash Earnings or \"GCE\"\n6,059 \n6,133 \nOperating Assets\nCurrent Assets (Less Cash and Short-term Investments)\n(1,909)\n(1,889)\nGross Properties\n(51,344)\n(49,498)\nOther Assets\n(4,263)\n(3,894)\nOperating Liabilities\nNon-Interest Bearing Liabilities\n11,035 \n10,825 \nGross Operating Assets or \"GOA\" \n (d)\n(46,481)\n(44,456)\nCapital Charge \n(e)\n(3,718)\n(3,556)\nEconomic Profit (Non-GAAP)\ncalculated as GCE less Capital Charge\n$\n2,341 \n$\n2,577 \n(a) See Note 20, Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements.\n(b) Unusual items are defined by management as unique events with greater than $100 million full year operating income impact, consistent with the terms of the Company's long-term incentive plan agreements.

More specifically, FCF measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. FCF is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds and advances from property dispositions. This measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. FCF before dividends decreased $561 million year-over-year to $2.8 billion primarily due to higher property additions and less cash from operating activities. Cash from operating activities in 2024 includes the impact of $387 million of federal and state tax payments related to the 2023 tax year that were previously postponed under tax relief announcements for those impacted by Hurricane Idalia. 2024 results also reflect non-cash impacts of $429 million of federal and state tax payments postponed to 2025 under tax relief announcements for those impacted by the 2024 hurricane season. Cash from operating activities in the prior year period includes the payment of $238 million for retroactive wages and bonuses, and associated taxes, related to finalized labor agreements.\nThe following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to FCF before dividends (non-GAAP measure).\n \nYears Ended\n \n2024 \n(a)\n2023 \n(a)\n(Dollars in Millions)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities \n$\n5,247\n \n$\n5,514\n \nProperty Additions \n(2,529)\n(2,257)\nProceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions\n66 \n88 \nFree Cash Flow or \"FCF\", before payment of dividends (Non-GAAP)\n$\n2,784 \n$\n3,345 \n(a) See Note 20, Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.36\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nOPERATING STATISTICS \n(Estimated)\nCertain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle. The methodology for calculating train velocity, dwell, cars online and trip plan performance differs from that used by the Surface Transportation Board.

The impact was insignificant.\nKey Performance Measures Definitions:\nTrain Velocity\n - Average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). Train velocity measures actual train miles and times of a train movement on CSX's network.\nDwell\n - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard.\nCars Online\n - Average number of active freight rail cars on lines operated by CSX, excluding rail cars that are being repaired, in storage, those that have been sold, or private cars dwelling at a customer location more than one day. \nOn-Time Origina\ntions\n - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.\nOn-Time Arrivals\n - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to within two hours of scheduled arrival.\nCarload Trip Plan Performance\n - Percent of measured cars (excludes unit trains and other non-scheduled service as well as empty automotive shipments) destined for a customer that complete their scheduled plan at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival or interchange (as applicable).\nIntermodal Trip Plan Performance\n - Percent of measured containers (excludes port shipments along with empty containers and other non-scheduled service) destined for a customer that complete their scheduled plan at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicab\nle).\nFuel Efficiency\n - Gallons of locomotive fuel per 1,000 gross ton-miles.\nRevenue Ton-Miles (RTM's)\n - The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile.\nGross Ton-Miles (GTM's)\n - The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents. \nFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index\n - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. \nFRA Train Accident Rate\n - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.37\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nThe Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.\nThe Company remains focused on safety, service, and controlling costs. Velocity improved by 2% while dwell increased by 10%, respectively, relative to 2023. Carload trip plan performance decreased to 79% compared to 84%, while intermodal trip plan performance decreased to 91% compared to 95%, relative to 2023. The Company continues to focus on operational improvements and executing the operating plan to deliver safe, reliable and efficient service to customers.\nWhile the personal injury frequency increased in 2024 compared to the prior year, the FRA train accident rate decreased. Safety is a top priority at CSX, and the Company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers, and communities in which the Company operates.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.\nSignificant Cash Flows\nThe following charts highlight the operating, investing and financing components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2024 and 2023. \n(a) See Note 20, Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.38\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nIn 2024, the Company generated $267 million less cash from operating activities compared to  prior year, primarily driven by the previously-discussed $387 million of federal and state tax payments related to the 2023 tax year. The 2024 results also reflect lower cash-generating net earnings as well as non-cash impacts of $429 million of federal and state tax payments postponed to 2025, as previously discussed. Cash from operating activities in the prior year includes the payment of $238 million for retroactive wages and bonuses, and associated taxes, related to finalized labor agreements. CSX used $378 million more cash for investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily as a result of higher property additions consistent with planned capital expenditures as well as the beginning of the Blue Ridge subdivision rebuild resulting from impacts of Hurricane Helene. The Company used $805 million less cash for financing activities compared to the prior year primarily due to lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher net debt repayments.\nSources of Cash and Liquidity\nThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company intends to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. In 2024, CSX issued $550 million of long-term debt. See Note 10, \nDebt and Credit Agreements\n for more information. \nCSX has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in February 2028. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.\nUses of Cash\nCSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. \nIn 2024, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.\n \nYears Ended\nCapital Expenditures \n(Dollars in Millions)\n2024\n2023 \n(a)\nTrack\n$\n1,039\n \n$\n983 \nBridges, Signals, PTC and Other\n802\n \n717 \nTotal Infrastructure\n1,841\n \n1,700 \nStrategic Projects and Commercial Facilities\n364\n \n304 \nLocomotives\n250\n \n117 \nFreight Cars\n74\n \n136 \nCash Invested for Capital Expenditures\n$\n2,529\n \n$\n2,257 \n(a) See Note 20, Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements.

Planned capital investments for 2025 are expected to be consistent with 2024, except for additional costs to rebuild the Blue Ridge subdivision. Spending on the Blue Ridge rebuild is currently estimated to exceed $400 million in total. Spending to sustain core infrastructure with a focus on safety and reliability will be a top priority. In addition, management is committed to investments that promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives, including investments in locomotives and freight cars. CSX intends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations.\nCSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see \nRisk Factors\n under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). \nCSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors.\n \nOn February 12, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.13 per common share effective March 2025. The 2025 dividend increase is the 21\nst\n consecutive increase in CSX's annual dividend. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.\nMaterial Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital\nCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. Further, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. \nTotal assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $552 million from prior year end. The increase in total assets was primarily due to a $937 million increase in net properties consistent with planned capital expenditures and a $123 million increase in investments in affiliates and other companies. These increases were partially offset by a $420 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents as noted above and a $108 million impairment of Quality Carriers' goodwill.\nTotal liabilities increased $30 million from prior year end primarily due to the issuance of $550 million in long-term debt and the deferral of $429 million of federal and state tax payments related to the 2024 tax year postponed under tax relief announcements for those impacted by the 2024 hurricane season. These increases were partially offset by debt repayments of $558 million and $387 million of federal and state tax payments related to the 2023 tax year that were previously postponed under tax relief announcements for those impacted by Hurricane Idalia. Total shareholders' equity increased $522 million from prior year end primarily driven by net earnings of $3.5 billion, partially offset by share repurchases of $2.2 billion and dividends paid of $930 million.\nWorking capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital deficit of $456 million at December 2024 and a surplus of $136 million at December 2023. This decrease of $592 million since year end is primarily driven by a $420 million decrease in cash as property additions of $2.5 billion, share repurchases of $2.2 billion, and dividend payments of $930 million more than offset $5.2 billion in cash generated by operating activities.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.40\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nThe Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. A working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and its ability to file and use shelf registration statements to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. \nCompleted Transactions\nAcquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc.\nOn June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am. The closing price of $600 million was funded through a combination of common stock valued at $422 million and cash totaling $178 million. Total cash consideration paid to acquire the business includes a $30 million deposit paid in fourth quarter 2020. For further details, refer to Note 17, \nBusiness Combinations\n.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia over three phases. Over the course of the transaction, which was completed in 2022, total proceeds of $525 million were collected and total gains of $493 million were recognized. This includes $125 million of proceeds collected and $144 million of gains recognized in 2022. For further details, refer to Note 6,\n Properties\n. \nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.41\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The three largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), and Fitch Ratings (\"Fitch\"), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA for S&P and Fitch and is Aaa for Moody’s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.\nCSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2024 with no changes in the Company's S&P or Moody's ratings from prior year. Additionally, Fitch published a new first time rating of A- in April 2024. The Company's credit ratings as of December 31, 2024 are summarized below:\nRating Agency\nLong-Term Ratings\nOutlook\nFitch\nA-\nStable\nMoody's\nA3\nStable\nS&P\nBBB+\nStable\n    \nThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. Ratings of BBB- by S&P and Fitch and Baa3 by Moody’s, or better, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt. The Company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.42\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nContractual Obligations \nCSX is party to contractual arrangements that obligate the Company to make future cash payments. These obligations impact the Company’s liquidity and capital resource needs. The Company’s contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, purchase commitments, leases, other-post employment benefits and agreements with Conrail.\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities. See Note 10, \nDebt and Credit Agreements\n, for additional information related to future debt payments. Future interest payments associated with outstanding debt total $14.3 billion, with $806 million payable in 2025.\n•\nPurchase commitments consist o\nf CSX’s long-term locomotive maintenance and rebuild program and other commitments to purchase technology, communications, railcar maintenance and other services. See Note 8, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information about future payments related to purchase commitments.\n•\nCapital expenditures include investments related to public-private partnerships. These partnership inve\nstments are typically for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through government awards or other funding sources. Project contribution commitments that are not reimbursable total $26 million as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nThe Company’s leases include property, equipment, and line leases. See Note 7, \nLeases\n, for additional information about future payments related to leases.\n•\nOther post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans that are unfunded. See Note 9, \nEmployee Benefit Plans\n, for additional information about future payments under such plans.\n•\nConrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation (\"NS\"). This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. See Note 15, \nInvestment in Affiliates and Related-Party Transactions\n, for additional information about future payments related to agreements with Conrail. \nOther Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther commitments total $208 million and primarily consist of surety bonds, guarantees, and letters of credit, none of which are individually significant. These off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nLABOR AGREEMENTS\nApproximately 17,500 of the Company's approximately 23,500 employees are members of a rail labor union.  There are 12 rail unions at CSX that participate in national bargaining. As of December 2, 2022, all of these rail unions were covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that remained in effect through December 31, 2024. Collective agreements under the Railway Labor Act do not expire, but continue until amended. Prior to the 2022 agreements becoming amendable, CSX worked with several major rail unions on new five-year labor agreements. As of the date of this filing, new labor agreements have been fully ratified by seven unions representing approximately 40% of the Company's unionized workforce.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.43\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:\n•\npersonal injury and environmental reserves;\n•\npension plan accounting; and\n•\ndepreciation policies for assets under the group-life method\nPersonal Injury and Environmental Reserves\nPersonal Injury\nPersonal Injury reserves of $142 million and $128 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, \nCasualty, Environmental and Other Reserves,\n \nin the consolidated financial statements.\nEnvironmental\nEnvironmental reserves were $151 million and $154 million for 2024\n \nand 2023, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 230 environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:\n•\ntype of clean-up required;\n•\nnature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);\n•\nextent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and\n•\nnumber, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.\nConditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, \nCasualty, Environmental and Other Reserves,\n \nin the consolidated financial statements.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.44\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates,\n continued\n    \nPension Plan Accounting\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.\n \nBeginning in 2020, the CSX Pension Plan was closed to new participants. As of December 2024, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $2.2 billion\n. \nFor information related to the funded status of the Company's pension plans, see Note 9, \nEmployee Benefit Plans\n.\nThe accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the \nCompensation-Retirement Benefits Topic\n in the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"). This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:\n•\ndiscount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;\n•\nlong-term rate of return on plan assets; and\n•\nother assumptions.\nThe Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.\nDiscount Rates\nDiscount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.\nThe Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity\n.\n \nThe weighted average discount rate used by the Company to value its pension obligations was 5.50% and 4.82% as of December 2024, and December 2023, respectively. As of December 2024, the estimated duration of pension benefits is approximately 9 years.\nEach year, the discount rate is reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rate will change.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.45\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates,\n continued\nLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2024 and 2023.\nOther Assumptions\nThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and salary inflation rates. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.\n2025 Estimated Pension Expense\nNet periodic pension benefit expense for 2025 is expected to be a credit of $7 million. Net periodic pension benefit expense for 2025 is expected to include service cost expense of $21 million. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense in 2024 was a credit of $20 million. The net decrease in the expected credit is primarily due to recent less favorable plan asset experience.\nThe following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1% change in certain assumptions on the 2025 estimated pension expense:\n(Dollars in Millions)\nPension Expense\nDiscount Rate\n$\n14 \nLong-term Rate of Return\n$\n24 \nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.46\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates,\n continued\nDepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method\nThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $52.2 billion on a gross basis at December 31, 2024. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis\n.\n Land is not depreciated.  \nManagement performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:\n•\nstatistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;\n•\nstatistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;\n•\nevaluation of current operations;\n•\nevaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;\n•\nprevious assessment of the condition of the assets; \n•\nmanagement's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;\n•\nexpected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and\n•\ncomparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.\nThe STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2022, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. The 2022 equipment study resulted in an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $80 million primarily due to deferred losses on assets depreciated using the group-life method. The Company plans to complete the next depreciation study for equipment assets in 2025.\nA 1% change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $14 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. There were no significant changes to the Company's asset lives as a result of the 2022 and 2020 studies.
