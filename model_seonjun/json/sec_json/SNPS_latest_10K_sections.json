The proliferation of silicon to power our digital world, where technology is omnipresent and interconnected, means computing is being reinvented with the rise of AI and software-defined systems. In turn, this is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world. \nThese developments are accompanied by increasing complexity. It is now common for a single chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) and embedded software into a single system-on-chip (SoC), requiring highly complex chip designs. The most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors. Transistors are the basic building blocks for ICs, each of which may have features that are less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. \nThese devices are manufactured using masks to direct beams of light onto a wafer of silicon. At such small dimensions, the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production, proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches. Designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems, such as multiple-patterning lithography, FinFET 3D transistors \n3\nTable of \nContents\nand Gate-All-Around Field-Effect transistor structures, which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production.\nThe rise of silicon-powered intelligent devices and AI has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and lower power consumption. Our customers, who design silicon and software-defined systems, are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative offerings in shorter timeframes and at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and systems design often hinges on providing products “better,” “sooner,” and “cheaper” than competitors. The design of these chips and systems is extremely complex and necessitates state-of-the-art solutions. Over the past several years, market verticals including AI, 5G, automotive and cloud computing infrastructure have contributed to the ongoing demand for our products and services.\nOur Role—As the Silicon to Systems Design Solutions Partner\nSynopsys' silicon to systems design solutions are designed to help our customers\n—\nchip and system engineers and software developers\n—\nspeed up time to market, achieve the highest quality of results, mitigate risk, and maximize profitability.\nChip and systems designers must determine how best to design, locate and connect the building blocks of chips, and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and cost-effectively. This is a complex, multi-step process that is expensive and time-consuming. Our wide range of products help at different steps in the overall design process, from the design of individual ICs to the design of larger systems. Our products increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks, keeping track of large amounts of data, adding intelligence to the design process, facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors. Our IP products offer proven, high-quality pre-configured circuits that are ready to use in a chip design, saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products. Our global service and support engineers provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers.\nProducts and Services\nDesign Automation Segment\nOur Design Automation segment includes the EDA and Other revenue groups.\nEDA\n \nDesigning ICs involves many complex steps, including, among others architecture definition, register transfer level (RTL) design, functional/RTL verification, logic design or synthesis, gate-level verification, floorplanning, place and route, and physical verification. Designers use our EDA products to accelerate and automate the chip design process, reduce errors and enable more powerful and robust designs, with improved productivity for faster time to market. \nAs the availability and amount of cloud-based data storage grows, customer interest in accessing EDA on the cloud is also increasing as customers seek to benefit from the scalability and flexibility that cloud computing can offer to their flows and engineering teams.

Our Stronger Through Wellbeing campaign encourages our leaders and managers to model the importance of health and wellbeing and create opportunities to engage in wellness-related activities as a team. We also offer a variety of programs and resources at no cost to employees and their family members to support their mental, emotional, and financial wellbeing.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe have a comprehensive employee feedback program, and we use the feedback to gain an understanding of the employee experience and to make improvements in a variety of areas. These areas include how we interact with customers to how we share best practices, and more. Through our annual SHAPE Synopsys surveys, we obtain employee insight into our values, manager effectiveness, ability to innovate, perceptions on inclusion and belonging, and other critical factors. We also use pulse surveys to create space for important conversations about who we are, where we are going, and how we can connect with each other and our work.\nIn October 2024, approximately 91% of our employees participated in the SHAPE survey. We received an engagement score of 80, which was calculated by averaging the scores of all employee responses to questions about job satisfaction on a 100-point scale. In fiscal 2024, Synopsys received nearly 60 awards for workplace and culture, including certification as a Great Place to Work in 14 countries and recognition from Newsweek, Forbes, Fortune, US News and World Report, Comparably, and more. These results demonstrate Synopsys' stability and resiliency, and the fact that we have a global workforce that is highly engaged. We saw strong scores from our employees regarding their excitement for the company's future, trust in leadership, sense of belonging to Synopsys, and personal investment in the mission. To help promote employee engagement and recognition, we invest in programs such as the annual Engineering and Innovation Conference (EILC) and Pitch Fest innovation contest to empower our team and inspire innovation. As we grow, we aspire to maintain our results-oriented culture by balancing productivity with smart investments in our employees’ development, while also supporting individual wellbeing. These are two key drivers of the overall employee experience.\nWe also believe ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance. Each year, our employees participate in our performance development process, which summarizes key accomplishments for the preceding year, establishes new stretch goals and objectives, and identifies critical capabilities for development. As part of this process, we encourage managers to solicit and share supportive multi-rater feedback, further strengthening the focus on teamwork and team success.\nTalent Development and Succession Planning\nWe offer several programs to support the career advancement of our employees. Through our digital learning platform, we seek to foster and support a “curious learning” culture where employees can access training, external articles, videos, and blogs. In addition, we host a series of in-person and on-demand learning sessions designed to build capability and adaptability required for the future. As employees advance in their careers, our training framework is intended to build new technical skills and core capabilities.\nOur management training is designed to increase capability in the areas of communication, engagement, coaching, inclusion and belonging, hiring, and key business skills.

Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements.\nUnless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates solely to our continuing operations and does not include the operations of our Software Integrity business. See “Software Integrity Divestiture” below and Note 3. \nDiscontinued Operations\n of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nin this Annual Report\n \nfor additional information about the Software Integrity Divestiture.\nFiscal 2024 Financial Performance Summary\nFor fiscal 2024, our results reflect continued, strong execution and the resiliency of our business, including 15% revenue growth compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to revenue growth across all products and geographies. We have seen our customer set continue to expand as more companies in more industries define and optimize system performance at the silicon level. We also continue to see our total cost of revenue and operating expenses increase as we invest in our workforce and grow our research and development capabilities. \nThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years:\n \nYear Ended October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\n$\n6,127.4 \n$\n5,318.0 \n$\n4,615.7 \nCost of revenue\n$\n1,245.3 \n$\n1,030.9 \n$\n898.0 \nOperating expenses\n$\n3,526.4 \n$\n3,013.9 \n$\n2,569.0 \nOperating income\n$\n1,355.7 \n$\n1,273.2 \n$\n1,148.7 \nNet income from continuing operations attributed to Synopsys\n$\n1,441.7 \n$\n1,227.0 \n$\n970.2 \nNet income from discontinued operations attributed to Synopsys\n$\n821.7 \n$\n2.8 \n$\n14.4 \nDiluted net income per share attributed to Synopsys:\nContinuing operations\n$\n9.25 \n$\n7.91 \n$\n6.20 \nDiscontinued operations\n$\n5.26 \n$\n0.01 \n$\n0.09 \nFiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 financial performance summary\n•\nRevenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of $809.4 million or 15%, primarily due to revenue growth across all products and geographies.\n•\nTotal cost of revenue and operating expenses was $4.8 billion, an increase of $726.9 million or 18%, primarily due to an increase of $325.8 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions.\n•\nOperating income was $1.4 billion, an increase of $82.5 million or 6%.\n•\nNet income from discontinued operations was $821.7 million, an increase of $818.9 million, primarily due to the gain on Software Integrity Divestiture.\nFiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 financial performance summary\n•\nRevenues were $5.3 billion, an increase of $702.3 million or 15%, primarily due to revenue growth across all products and geographies.\n•\nTotal cost of revenue and operating expenses was $4.0 billion, an increase of $577.8 million or 17%, primarily due to an increase of $246.7 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions.\n•\nOperating income was $1.3 billion, an increase of $124.5 million or 11%.\n36\nTable of \nContents\nBusiness Summary\nSynopsys delivers trusted and comprehensive silicon to systems design solutions, from EDA, including system verification and validation solutions, to silicon IP. We partner closely with semiconductor and systems customers across a wide range of industries to maximize their engineering and research and development capacity. We are catalyzing the era of pervasive intelligence, powering innovation today that ignites the ingenuity of tomorrow. For more information about our business segments and product groups, see Part I, Item 1 \nBusiness\n of this Annual Report.\nWe have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Polices and Basis of Presentation\n of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nin this Annual Report for a discussion on our revenue recognition policy\n. \nThe revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenue in a significant way.\nOur growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our Design Automation products, expanding and proliferating our Design IP offerings and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market. Our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time based and upfront products. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.\nPending Acquisition of Ansys\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ansys, a provider of broad engineering simulation and analysis software and services, in a cash-and-stock transaction (the Ansys Merger) that values Ansys at approximately $35.0 billion, based on the closing price of Synopsys common stock on December 21, 2023.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Ansys Merger (the Effective Time), each share of Ansys common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (with certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive 0.3450 (the Exchange Ratio) of a share of Synopsys common stock and $197.00 in cash, without interest. The Exchange Ratio is expected to result in Ansys equityholders and Synopsys equityholders owning approximately 16.5% and 83.5%, respectively, of the combined company on a pro forma basis following the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement also provides for Synopsys’ assumption of certain outstanding Ansys options and other unvested Ansys equity awards held by continuing Ansys employees. If the stock consideration to be issued by Synopsys in connection with the Ansys Merger exceeds 19.9999% of the shares of Synopsys common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that the aggregate number of shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Ansys Merger does not exceed such threshold, and the cash consideration will be correspondingly increased to offset such adjustment.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, two members of the board of directors of Ansys selected by mutual agreement of Synopsys and Ansys will become members of the Board of Directors of Synopsys. If the closing occurs less than six months prior to the next annual meeting of Synopsys’ stockholders, Synopsys will nominate such directors for election at such meeting. On March 19, 2024, Synopsys and Ansys mutually agreed to designate Dr. Ajei Gopal, the current President and Chief Executive Officer of Ansys, to become a member of the Synopsys Board of Directors at the Effective Time, subject to the completion of Synopsys’ director nomination process and satisfaction of all applicable eligibility requirements established by Synopsys’ Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Ansys and Synopsys have not yet determined or agreed on the remaining member of the Ansys board of directors to be appointed to the Synopsys Board of Directors. \nThe Ansys Merger was approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ansys common stock on May 22, 2024 and is anticipated to close in the first half of calendar year 2025. The Ansys Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among other things, the clearance of the Ansys Merger under certain antitrust and foreign investment regimes, and the continued effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-277912) filed by us on March 14, 2024 and declared\n effective by the SEC on April 17, 2024\n. Following the determination that it was a necessary step towards obtaining governmental approval of and successfully closing the Ansys Merger, on September 3, 2024, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of \n37\nTable of \nContents\nour Optical Solutions Group to Keysight Technologies, Inc. (the Optical Solutions Divestiture). The Optical Solutions Divestiture is subject to customary closing conditions, including review by regulatory authorities, and the successful closing of the Ansys Merger.\nWe and Ansys each have termination rights under the Merger Agreement. A fee of $1.5 billion may be payable by us to Ansys, or a fee of $950.0 million may be payable by Ansys to us, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, each as more fully described in the Merger Agreement. The receipt of financing by us is not a condition to complete the Ansys Merger.\nIn connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on January 15, 2024 (the Bridge Commitment Letter) with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, a senior unsecured bridge facility (the Bridge Commitment). On October 3, 2024, we reduced the Bridge Commitment by $1.1 billion to $10.6 billion following the closing of the Software Integrity Divestiture (as defined below). The Bridge Commitment currently provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $10.6 billion. On February 13, 2024, we entered into a term loan facility credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement), which provides us with the ability to borrow up to $4.3 billion at the closing of the Ansys Merger, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions for similar facilities, for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees and expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. See Note 11.\n Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities\n of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n in this Annual Report for more information on the Bridge Commitment and the Term Loan Agreement.\nFor more on risks related to the Ansys Merger, see Part I, Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, “\nRisks Related to the Ansys Merger\n\" of this Annual Report.\nImpact of the Current Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Environment\nUncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including the effects of, among other things, sustained global inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates, potential economic slowdowns or recessions, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and associated global economic conditions, have resulted in volatility in credit, equity and foreign currency markets. In fiscal 2024, while we saw continued strength in the artificial intelligence and high-performance computing sectors, certain industries such as industrial, automotive and consumer electronics are recovering more slowly from recent macroeconomic uncertainty. We expect growth across our geographies in fiscal 2025; however, we are expecting a challenging near-term growth environment, including in China, due to macroeconomic factors as well as, to a lesser degree, Entity List and other global trade restrictions. For more on the anticipated impact of export control regulations, see the discussion below and in Part I, Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n of this Annual Report.\nThe current uncertain macroeconomic environment could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. For more on risks related to the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, see Part I, Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, “\nUncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition\n” of this Annual Report. \nWe are also actively monitoring geopolitical pressures around the world, including, among others, changes in China-Taiwan relations, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and other regional or global military conflicts. Any significant disruption caused by these or other geopolitical pressures or conflicts could materially affect our employees, business, operating results, financial condition or customers in those regions of the world. For example, Synopsys has employees, operations, customers and strategic partners in the Middle East. While we are actively monitoring this conflict, at this time, it has not had a material impact on our business, operating results or financial condition to date.\nWhile our time-based model provides stability to our business, operating results and overall financial position, the broader implications of these macroeconomic or geopolitical events, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. Further, the negative impact of these events or disruptions may be deferred due to our business model.\nSee Part I, Item 1A,\n Risk Factors\n of this Annual Report for further discussion of the impact of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty on our business, operations and financial condition.\n38\nTable of \nContents\nDevelopments in Export Control Regulations\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce published changes to U.S. export control regulations (U.S. Export Regulations), including, among other things, the inclusion of certain Chinese technology companies on the Entity List, restrictions on the export of electronic computer-aided design software specially designed for the development of ICs with Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor structures, and certain other restrictions to China’s access to certain semiconductor and advanced computing technology. We currently believe U.S. Export Regulations will not have a material impact on our business. We anticipate additional changes to U.S. Export Regulations in the future, but we cannot forecast the scope or timing of such changes, nor the impact on our business. We will continue to monitor such developments, including potential additional trade restrictions, and other regulatory or policy changes by the U.S. and foreign governments.\nFor more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the U.S. government’s Entity List and other U.S. Export Regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, \nRisk Factors\n, “\nWe are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets\n.”\nSoftware Integrity Divestiture\nOn May 5, 2024, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement), by and between Synopsys and Sapphire Software Buyer, Inc. (Buyer), an entity controlled by funds affiliated with Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. and Francisco Partners (together, the Sponsors). On September 30, 2024, we completed the previously announced sale of our Software Integrity business to entities controlled by funds affiliated with the Sponsors (the Software Integrity Divestiture). We previously determined that the Software Integrity business met the criteria to be disclosed as discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. See Note 3. \nDiscontinued Operations\n of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nin this Annual Report for additional information on discontinued operations.\nBusiness Segments\nDesign Automation.\n This segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services and system integration products. This segment also includes digital, custom and field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated circuit (IC) design software, verification software and hardware products, system integration products and services, and manufacturing software products. Designers use our EDA products to accelerate and automate the chip design process, reduce errors and enable more powerful and robust designs, with improved productivity for faster time to market. \nDesign IP.\n This segment includes our interface, foundation, security, and embedded processor IP, IP subsystems, and IP implementation services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. We are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven IP solutions for system-on-chips (SoCs). This includes IP that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, Internet of Things and AI/data center markets, enabling designers to quickly develop SoCs in these areas.\nFiscal Year End\nHistorically, our fiscal years have been 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday nearest to October 31. Fiscal 2024 was a 53-week year ending on November 2, 2024, which impacted our revenue, expenses and operating results. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 52-week years and ended on October 28, 2023, and October 29, 2022, respectively. The extra week in fiscal 2024 resulted in approximately $70.5 million of additional revenue, and approximately $61.0 million of additional expenses, including approximately $11.0 million in stock-based compensation costs. The financial impact of one extra week included the amounts associated with the discontinued operations.\nWe have changed our fiscal year end from the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consisting of 52 or 53 fiscal weeks to a fiscal year end of October 31 each year. The fiscal year change becomes effective with our fiscal year 2025, which began on November 3, 2024. Our fiscal quarters will end on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year.\nFor presentation purposes, this Annual Report refers to the closest calendar month end.\n39\nTable of \nContents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n \nIn preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. See Note 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation \nof the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n in this Annual Report for further information on our significant accounting policies.\nThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:\n•\nRevenue recognition; and\n•\nBusiness combinations.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Arrangements with customers can involve multiple products and various license rights. Customers can\n \nnegotiate for a broad portfolio of solutions, and favorable terms along with future purchase options to manage their overall costs. Analysis of the terms and conditions in these contracts and their effect on revenue recognition may require significant judgment. \nWe have concluded that our EDA software licenses in Technology Subscription License (TSL) contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. Where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. \nFor our IP licensing arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and support services are distinct from each other, and therefore treated as separate performance obligations. Revenues from IP licenses are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control of the IP license, and support services are recognized over the support period \nas a stand ready obligation to the customer.\nWe are required to estimate total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) which are recognized and measured on the acquisition date in accordance with our \"Revenue Recognition\" policy in Note 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation \nof the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n in this Annual Report\n, \nas if we had originated the contracts. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimates for intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:\n•\nfuture expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;\n40\nTable of \nContents\n•\nhistorical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n•\nestimated obsolescence rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets;\n•\nthe expected use of the acquired assets; and\n•\ndiscount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value, which are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks.\nThe fair value of the definite-lived intangibles was determined using variations of the income approach.\nFor acquisitions completed in fiscal 2024, the fair value for acquired existing technology was determined by applying the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The relief from royalty method applies a royalty rate to projected income to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. The economic useful life was determined based on historical technology obsolescence patterns and prospective technology developments. We assumed royalty rates ranging from 35% to 40%. The present value of operating cash flows from the existing technology was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 11% to 14%.\nCustomer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships with the acquired company’s customers. Their fair value was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, which involves isolating the net earnings attributable to the asset being measured based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the asset over its remaining useful life. The economic useful life was determined based on historical customer turnover rates. Projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging from 55% to 95%. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 11% to 14%.\nWe believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of acquired intangible assets are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue \nOur revenues are generated from two business segments: the Design Automation segment and the Design IP segment. See Note 20. \nSegment Disclosure\n of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nin this Annual Report for more information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions. \nFurther disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:\nDesign Automation Segment\n•\nEDA solutions include digital, custom and FPGA IC design software, verification software and hardware products, system integration products and services, and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. EDA products and services are typically sold through TSL arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement; software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. The duration of our TSL contracts is generally three years, though it may vary for specific arrangements. We have concluded that the software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses and support represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under TSL contracts ratably over the term of the license. \n•\nIn the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term \n41\nTable of \nContents\nand have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of shipment because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. We have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term. \n•\nRevenue from Professional Service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. We have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.\nDesign IP Segment\n•\nDesign IP includes our interface, foundation, security, and embedded processor IP, IP subsystems, and IP implementation services. These arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed IP and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time. Revenue allocated to the IP licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our IP. Payments for IP contracts are generally received upon delivery of the IP. Revenue related to the customization of certain IP is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress.\nOur customer arrangements can involve multiple products and various license rights, and our customers negotiate with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they generally request a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets.

For example, we experience fluctuations in our revenues due to factors such as the timing of IP product sales, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) drawdowns, royalties, and hardware products sales. As revenues from IP products sales and hardware products sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such IP products and hardware products could result in increased variability of our total revenues.\nContracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations (backlog) as of October 31, 2024 were approximately $8.1 billion, which includes $1.2 billion in non-cancellable FSA commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. We have elected to exclude future sales-based royalty payments from the remaining performance obligations. Approximately 41% of the backlog as of October 31, 2024, excluding non-cancellable FSA, is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter. The majority of the remaining backlog is expected to be recognized in the following three years\n. \nThe backlog was approximately $8.1 billion\n \nas of October 31, 2023, which included $1.4 billion in non-cancellable FSA commitments from customers.\nThe amount and composition of unsatisfied performance obligations will fluctuate period to period. We do not believe the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations is indicative of future sales or revenue, or that such obligations at the end of any given period correlates with actual sales performance of a particular geography or \n42\nTable of \nContents\nparticular products and services.

We also held $2.2 million in restricted cash primarily associated with deposits for office leases and employee loan programs. Our cash equivalents consisted primarily of taxable money market mutual funds, time deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Our short-term investments include U.S. government and municipal obligations, investment-grade available-for-sale debt and asset backed securities with an overall weighted-average credit rating of approximately AA. \nAs of October 31, 2024, approximately $916.9 million \nof our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. \nWe expect that the pending Ansys Merger is likely to result in a material increase in our debt and liquidity needs that will impact our capital needs during the next twelve months and beyond. We intend to fund our anticipated $19 billion cash consideration payment through a combination of cash and debt, and have a fully-committed debt financing in place for $14.9 billion (including \n$10.6 billion\n under the Bridge Commitment). Net cash proceeds received from certain debt and equity issuances or the sale of certain businesses and assets, including the Software Integrity Divestiture, as well as term loan commitments under certain qualifying term loan facilities, will result in mandatory commitment reductions under the Bridge Commitment. On October 3, 2024, we reduced the Bridge Commitment by $1.1 billion to $10.6 billion following the closing of the Software Integrity Divestiture. See Note 11. \nBridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities\n of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n in this Annual Report for further discussion.\nEffective fiscal 2023, our research and development expenditures were required to be capitalized and amortized under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act instead of being deducted when incurred for US tax purposes, which significantly increases our federal cash tax liability. Additionally, as a result of the IRS tax relief for the California winter storms, the due date for our fiscal 2023 federal tax payment was November 16, 2023 and as such, we deferred our fiscal 2023 federal cash tax payments until the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This resulted in a significant increase to our cash outflows beginning in fiscal 2024. See Note 18. \nIncome Taxes\n of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n in this Annual Report for further discussion.\n48\nTable of \nContents\nCash Flows\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows include cash flows related to the Software Integrity business. Significant non-cash items and capital expenditures of discontinued operations related to our Software Integrity business are presented separately in Note 3. \nDiscontinued Operations \nof the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nFor a discussion of fiscal 2023 changes compared to fiscal 2022, see the discussion in Item 7, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nin our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, filed on December 12, 2023.\n \nYear Ended October 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n \n(dollars in millions)\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,407.0 \n$\n1,703.3 \n$\n(296.3)\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities\n$\n1,223.0 \n$\n(482.1)\n$\n1,705.1 \nCash used in financing activities\n$\n(181.3)\n$\n(1,196.9)\n$\n1,015.6 \nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to \nhigher federal tax payments of $471.0 million, which included $187.0 million of fiscal 2023 federal tax payments that were paid in fiscal 2024 as a result of payment deadline extensions due to IRS tax relief for the California winter storms.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $1.2 billion for fiscal 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $482.1 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by net cash proceeds of $1.4 billion from the \nSoftware Integrity Divestiture, \nlower cash paid for acquisitions of $140.7 million, lower purchases of property and equipment of $66.5 million and higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of $55.7 million.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nThe decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower stock repurchases of $1.2 billion, as we have suspended the Program in connection with the pending Ansys Merger until we reduce our expected debt levels, partially offset by higher taxes paid for net share settlements of $96.1 million, the payment of costs related to the Bridge Commitment and the Term Loan of $72.3 million in connection with the Ansys Merger, and lower proceeds from issuance of common stock of $20.8 million.    \nBridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into the Bridge Commitment Letter with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the Bridge Commitment. The Bridge Commitment currently provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $10.6 billion. The proceeds of any borrowing under the Bridge Commitment will be used for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees and expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe commitments to provide the Bridge Commitment may be terminated in whole or reduced in part, at our discretion. In addition, the Bridge Commitment Letter provides that net cash proceeds received from certain debt and equity issuances or the sale of certain businesses and assets, including the Software Integrity Divestiture, as well as term loan commitments under certain qualifying term loan facilities, will result in mandatory commitment reductions under the Bridge Commitment.

Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5-year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%.

As of \nOctober 31, 2024\n, \n$194.3 million\n remained available for future stock repurchases under the Program. In connection with the pending Ansys Merger, we have suspended our stock repurchase program until we reduce our expected debt levels.\nThe IR Act was enacted in the United States on August 16, 2022. The IR Act imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. The total taxable value of shares repurchased is reduced by the fair market value of any newly issued shares during the taxable year. \nAs of October 31, 2024, this does not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. \nRisks related to the IR Act are described in Part I, Item 1A,\n Risk Factors\n.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. \nLeases\nWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets.

Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms may allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.\nTerm Loan\nRefer to \"Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities” under Item 7, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n included in this Annual Report for more information. \nLong Term Accrued Income Taxes\nAs of \nOctober 31, 2024\n, we had $18.8 million of long-term accrued income taxes which represent uncertain tax benefits. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2024 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.\n51\nTable of \nContents",
