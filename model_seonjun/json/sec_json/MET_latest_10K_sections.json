We hold leading market positions in the United States (“U.S.”), Asia, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. We are also one of the largest institutional investors in the U.S. with a general account portfolio invested primarily in fixed income securities (corporate, structured products, municipals, and government and agency) and mortgage loans, as well as real estate, real estate joint ventures, other limited partnerships and equity securities. \nWe believe that our trusted global brand, diversified and resilient business, and position as a leader in attractive markets are the powers of our business. Over the next five years we will execute on our New Frontier strategy, which was designed to accelerate growth across our global platform while delivering attractive returns and all-weather performance. New Frontier builds upon the success of our Next Horizon strategy, which we implemented in 2019, with an aim to focus, simplify and differentiate the Company.\nUnder our New Frontier strategy, we intend to leverage the Company’s strengths to prioritize growth across four key areas of opportunity:\n•\nExtend our leadership in Group Benefits;\n•\nCapitalize on our unique retirement platform;\n•\nAccelerate our growth in Asset Management; and\n•\nExpand in high growth international markets.\nMetLife is organized into six segments: Group Benefits; Retirement and Income Solutions (“RIS”); Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. Se\ne \n“— Segments and Corporate & Other” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s segments and Corporate & Other.\nMetLife\nGroup Benefits\nRIS\nAsia\nLatin America\nEMEA\nMetLife Holdings\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, MetLife and General Atlantic, L.P. (“General Atlantic”) announced the formation of a life and annuity reinsurance company, Chariot Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Chariot Re”) which is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. MetLife will own an equity interest in Chariot Re. MetLife is targeting ceding a block of liabilities composed of structured settlement annuity contracts and group annuity contracts associated with pension risk transfers to Chariot Re. MetLife Investment Management and General Atlantic will exclusively provide global investment management services to Chariot Re.\n5\nTable of Contents\nSegments and Corporate & Other \nWe offer a broad range of products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of our customers. We sell these products to corporations and other institutions (including local, state and federal governments) and their respective employees, as well as individuals.\nGroup Benefits\nWe have built a leading position in the U.S. group insurance market through long-standing relationships with many of the largest employers in the U.S.\nOur Group Benefits segment, based in the U.S., offers life insurance, dental, group short- and long-term disability, paid family and medical leave, individual disability, accidental death and dismemberment (“AD&D”) insurance, accident & health insurance, and vision, as well as prepaid legal plans and pet insurance. We also sell administrative services-only (“ASO”) arrangements to some employers.\nWe distribute Group Benefits products and services through a sales force primarily comprised of MetLife employees that is segmented by the size of the target customer. Account executives sell either directly to corporate and other group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. Employers have been emphasizing voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and marketing to employees in order to further foster sales of those products.\nWe have entered into arrangements with third parties to expand opportunities to market and distribute Group Benefits products and services. We also sell Group Benefits products and services through sponsoring associations and affinity groups and provide life, dental, accident & health, and vision coverage to certain employees of the U.S. Government. We have longstanding relationships with these employees and continue to cultivate and expand them through additional product offerings.\nOur Group Benefits segment quarterly claims experience may vary, as seasonal illnesses effect mortality and morbidity, and due to utilization rate fluctuation in our non-medical health businesses. Annual benefit renewal implementation, enrollment, and marketing costs normally elevate expenses for the Group Benefits segment in the fourth quarter.\nMajor Products\nTerm Life Insurance\nA guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Premiums may be guaranteed at a level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and non-guaranteed. Term contracts expire without value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party is still living.\nVariable Life Insurance\nInsurance coverage through a contract that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with certain guarantees. Premiums and account balances can be directed by the policyholder into a variety of separate account investment options or directed to the Company’s general account. In the separate account investment options, the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment results. With some products, by maintaining certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience.\nUniversal Life Insurance\nInsurance coverage on the same basis as variable life, except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances, are allocated only to the Company’s general account. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience.\nDental \nInsurance and ASO arrangements that assist employees, retirees and their families in maintaining oral health while reducing out-of-pocket expenses.\nDisability \nInsurance and ASO arrangements for groups and individuals to provide benefits for income replacement, payment of business overhead expenses or mortgage protection, in the event of the disability of the insured.\nAccident & Health Insurance\nAccident, critical illness or hospital indemnity coverage to the insured.\nVision \nInsurance, ASO arrangements, and managed eye health and vision care solutions to assist employees, retirees and their families in maintaining vision health while reducing out-of-pocket expenses. Offered to commercial groups, individuals, health plans and government sponsored programs through a nationwide provider network, retail optical chains and online eyewear providers. \n6\nTable of Contents\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nOur RIS segment, based in the U.S., provides funding and financing solutions that help institutional customers mitigate and manage liabilities primarily associated with their employee benefit programs using a spectrum of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products. \nWe distribute RIS products and services through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers primarily comprised of MetLife employees. We may sell products directly to benefit plan sponsors and advisors or through brokers, consultants or other intermediaries. In addition, these sales professionals work with individual, group and global distribution areas to better reach and service customers, brokers, consultants and other intermediaries.\nMajor Products\nStable Value Products\n• General account guaranteed interest contracts \n(“\nGIC\ns”) are designed to provide stable value investment options within tax-qualified defined contribution plans by offering a fixed maturity investment with a guarantee of liquidity at contract value for participant transactions.\n• Separate account GIC\ns are available to defined contribution plan sponsors by offering market value returns on separate account investments with a general account guarantee that plan participants will always be able to transact in their accounts at contract value.\n• Synthetic GICs or “wraps” \nare contracts available only to the sponsor of a participant-directed defined contribution plan. The contract “wraps” a portfolio of investments owned by the plan to provide a guarantee that plan participants will always be able to transact in their accounts at contract value. Generally, a wrap contract means that participants will not experience negative returns.\n• Private floating rate funding agreements\n are generally privately placed, unregistered investment contracts issued as general account obligations with interest credited based on a specified rate or agreed upon short-term benchmark rate. These agreements are used for money market funds, securities lending cash collateral portfolios and short-term investment funds.\nAnnuities\nPension Risk Transfers\nGeneral account\n and \nseparate account annuities\n are offered in connection with defined benefit pension plans which include single premium buyouts allowing for full or partial transfers of pension liabilities.\n• General account annuities\n include non-participating group contract benefits purchased for retired or active employees covered under terminating or ongoing pension plans. \n \n• Separate account annuities\n include both participating and non-participating group contract benefits. Participating contract benefits are purchased for retired, terminated, or active employees covered under active or terminated pension plans. The assets supporting the guaranteed benefits for each contract are held in a separate account, however, the Company fully guarantees all benefit payments. Non-participating contracts have economic features similar to our general account product, but offer the added protection of an insulated separate account. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), these annuity contracts are treated as general account products.\nInstitutional Income Annuities\nGeneral account contracts that are guaranteed payout annuities purchased for employees upon retirement or termination of employment. Contracts can be life or non-life contingent non-participating contracts which do not provide for any loan or cash surrender value and, with few exceptions, do not permit future considerations.\nStructured Settlements\nCustomized annuities designed to serve as an alternative to a lump sum payment in a lawsuit initiated because of personal injury, wrongful death, or a workers’ compensation claim or other claim for damages. Surrenders are generally not allowed, although commutations are permitted in certain circumstances. Guaranteed payments consist of life contingent annuities, term certain annuities and lump sums.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRisk Solutions\nLongevity Reinsurance Solutions\nLongevity reinsurance is a risk mitigation solution for United Kingdom (“U.K.”) pension plan sponsors and U.K. insurance companies that write pension risk transfer business, converting uncertain future pension benefit obligations into a fixed stream of payments to MetLife over the duration of the contract as opposed to a lump sum at inception in typical pension risk transfer transactions.\nBenefit Funding Solutions\nSpecialized life insurance products and funding agreements designed specifically to provide solutions for funding postretirement benefits and company-, bank- or trust-owned life insurance used to finance nonqualified benefit programs for executives.\nFunded Reinsurance Solutions\nFunded reinsurance is a risk mitigation tool for insurance companies that write pension risk transfer business primarily in the U.K. It provides a single-premium reinsurance solution that transfers both the longevity risk and investment risk associated with U.K. bulk pensions.\nCapital Markets Investment Products\n• Funding agreement-backed notes\n are offered in medium term note programs, under which funding agreements are issued to special-purpose trusts that issue marketable notes in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. The proceeds of these note issuances are used to acquire funding agreements with matching interest and maturity payment terms from certain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. The notes are underwritten and marketed by major investment banks’ broker-dealer operations and are sold to institutional investors.\n• Funding agreement-backed commercial paper\n is issued by a special-purpose limited liability company which deposits the proceeds under a master funding agreement issued to it by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). The commercial paper is issued in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, receives the same short-term credit rating as MLIC and is marketed by major investment banks’ broker-dealer operations. \n• Funding agreements\n are issued by\n \ncertain of our insurance subsidiaries to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”) and to a subsidiary of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.\nAsia\nOur Asia operations are geographically diverse encompassing both developed and emerging markets. We operate in nine jurisdictions throughout Asia, with our largest operation in Japan. We market our products and services through a range of proprietary and third-party distribution channels. \nIn Japan, our face-to-face channels, including both career and general agency, continue to be critical to our overall distribution strategy, catering to various needs of individual retail customers. Outside of Japan, our distribution strategies vary by market and leverage a combination of career and general agencies and bancassurance. In select markets, we also use independent brokers for retail sales and our employee sales force to sell group products.\nMajor Products\nLife Insurance\nWhole and term life, endowments, universal and variable life, as well as group life products.\nAccident & Health Insurance\nFull range of accident & health products, including hospitalization, cancer, critical illness, disability, income protection and personal accident coverage.\nRetirement and Savings\nFixed and variable annuities, as well as regular savings products.\nLatin America\nOur largest operations are in Mexico and Chile. We market our products and services through a multi-channel distribution strategy which varies by geographic region and stage of market development. \nWe have an exclusive and captive agency distribution network which sells a variety of individual life, accident & health, and pension products. Our direct marketing channel includes sponsors and telesales representatives selling mainly accident & health and individual life products directly to consumers. We also work with brokers and independent agents on sales of group and individual life, accident & health, group medical, dental and pension products, and worksite marketing. We also offer to government employees life and medical insurance, as well as retirement and savings, and other products.\n8\nTable of Contents\nMajor Products\nLife Insurance\nWhole and term life, endowments, universal and variable life, as well as group life products. \nRetirement and Savings\nFixed annuities and pension products. Fixed income annuities provide for asset distribution needs. Our savings-oriented pension products are primarily offered in Chile under a mandatory privatized social security system.\nAccident & Health Insurance\nGroup and individual major medical, accidental, and supplemental health products, including AD&D, hospital indemnity, medical reimbursement, and medical coverage for serious medical conditions, as well as dental products.\nCredit Insurance\nPolicies designed to fulfill certain loan obligations in the event of the policyholder’s death.\nEMEA\nWe operate across EMEA in both developed (Western Europe) and emerging (Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa) markets. Our largest operations are in the Gulf region, the U.K. and France. In more mature markets, we focus our strategy on our preferred market segments to play a “niche” role. We also have a strong market presence in emerging markets leveraging a multi-channel distribution strategy.\nOur businesses in EMEA use captive and independent agency, independent brokerage, bancassurance, corporate solutions and direct-to-consumer distribution channels.\nMajor Products\nLife Insurance\nTraditional and non-traditional life insurance products, such as whole and term life, endowments and variable life products, as well as group term life programs in most markets.\nRetirement and Savings\nFixed annuities and pension products, including group pension programs in select markets.\nAccident & Health Insurance\nIndividual and group personal accident and supplemental health products, including AD&D, hospital indemnity, scheduled medical reimbursement plans, and coverage for serious medical conditions. In addition, we provide individual and group major medical coverage in select markets.\nCredit Insurance\nPolicies designed to fulfill certain loan obligations in the event of the policyholder’s death.\nMetLife Holdings\nThis segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses that we no longer actively market in the U.S. These include variable, universal, term and whole life insurance, variable, fixed and index-linked annuities, and long-term care insurance. It also includes an in-force block of assumed variable annuity guarantees from a third party. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on a reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023. \n9\nTable of Contents\nMajor Products\nVariable, Universal and Term Life Insurance\nSimilar to products offered by our Group Benefits segment, except that these products were historically marketed to individuals through various retail distribution channels. For a description of these products, see “— Group Benefits.”\nWhole Life Insurance\nA benefit upon the death of the insured in return for the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined period. Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders may receive dividends in cash, or apply them to increase death benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force.\nVariable Annuities \nVariable annuities provide for asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to allocate deposits into various investment options in a separate account, as determined by the contractholder. In certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the Company’s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Contractholders may also elect certain minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees are charged and where asset allocation restrictions may apply.\nFixed and Indexed-Linked Annuities\nFixed annuities provide for asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Deposits made into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the Company’s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Fixed income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant. Additionally, the Company has issued indexed-linked annuities which allow the contractholder to participate in returns from equity indices.\nLong-term Care \nProtection against the potentially high costs of long-term health care services. Generally pays benefits to insureds who need assistance with activities of daily living or have a cognitive impairment.\nCorporate & Other \nCorporate & Other contains various start-up, developing and run-off businesses. Also included in Corporate & Other are: the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments (including external integration and disposition costs, internal resource costs for associates committed to acquisitions and dispositions and enterprise-wide strategic initiatives), interest expense related to the majority of the Company’s outstanding debt, expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues, the elimination of intersegment amounts (which generally relate to investment expenses and intersegment loans bearing interest rates commensurate with related borrowings), and the Company’s institutional investment management business (through which the Company provides public fixed income, private capital and real estate investment solutions to institutional investors worldwide). \nPolicyholder Liabilities\nWe establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Our liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy and the amount of benefits or claims to be paid. We establish liabilities for claims and benefits based on assumptions and estimates of losses and liabilities incurred. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on policyholder liabilities see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Future Policy Benefit Liabilities.”\nMetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated reinsurers, establish statutory reserves under methods prescribed by the insurance laws of their respective domiciliary jurisdiction. These reserves are reported as liabilities, and we expect them to be sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory reserves and actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits reported under GAAP generally differ due to the difference in accounting requirements.\n10\nTable of Contents\nU.S. state insurance laws and regulations require certain MetLife entities to submit an annual opinion and memorandum of a qualified actuary. In it, the qualified actuary states that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, adequately provide for the anticipated cash flow required to meet contractual obligations and related expenses. \nInsurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare and submit a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements. See “— Regulation — State Insurance Regulation — Reserves and Asset Adequacy Analysis.”\nUnderwriting and Pricing \nWe use a variety of underwriting and pricing management controls. Our Global Risk Management department develops product pricing standards and oversees underwriting practices in MetLife’s insurance businesses. We also regularly conduct experience studies to monitor assumptions against expectations, impose formal new product approval processes, periodically update product profitability studies, and use reinsurance to manage our exposures, as appropriate. See “— Reinsurance Activity.”\nUnderwriting\nOur underwriters and actuaries use detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures to assess and quantify insurance risks, and determine the type and the amount of risk we are willing to accept.\nInsurance underwriters consider an applicant’s medical history and other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group insurance underwriters generally evaluate the risk characteristics of the prospective insured group, but may underwrite members of a group on an individual basis for certain voluntary products and coverages. Our own employees generally perform our underwriting, but intermediaries review certain policies under guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. We review requests for coverage on their merits and issue policies only after we have examined and approved the particular risk or group under our underwriting guidelines.\nWe periodically review all our underwriting to maintain high standards of quality and consistency. Our reinsurers generally have the right to audit our underwriting.\nWe use underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies that we intend to be competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us, to facilitate quality sales, and to serve our customers’ needs while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. We aim to ensure that underwriting risk levels are appropriately reflected in our product pricing. \nWe continually review our underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate. \nPricing\nProduct pricing reflects our globally consistent standards. Regional product and finance teams price all of our insurance business with oversight from Global Risk Management. We base our pricing on the expected benefits payout which we calculate through the use of assumptions for mortality, longevity, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns and macroeconomic factors such as inflation. We price investment-oriented products based on factors such as investment returns, expenses, persistency, optionality, and possible variability of results. \nOur pricing of certain products may include prospective and retrospective experience rating features. For prospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses. For retrospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine our cost of providing insurance for the customer in light of any features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the policyholder based on prior years’ experience.\n We continually review our pricing guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate. \n11\nTable of Contents\nReinsurance Activity\nWe enter into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for our various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some pension products and insurance products issued by third parties. We purchase reinsurance in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. Our reinsurance covers individual risks, group risks, or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess, or catastrophe excess basis. The extent of our retained risks depends on our risk evaluation, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on our risk appetite. We also cede first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. We reinsure both mortality and other risks. We obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes and when its economic impact makes it appropriate to do so.\nWe also reinsure for risk and capital management purposes among affiliates, including affiliated U.S. captive reinsurers and affiliated non-U.S. reinsurers. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Affiliated Reinsurance Transactions.” \nFor information regarding reinsurance by segment, our catastrophic coverage, and ceded reinsurance recoverable balances, included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulation \nOverview\nIn the U.S., state regulators primarily regulate our life insurance companies, with additional federal regulation of some of our products and services. The insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions apply to MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Furthermore, consumer protection laws, privacy, anti-money laundering, securities, commodities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) also apply to some of MetLife’s operations, products and services.\nOutside of the U.S., insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance businesses are located or operate principally regulate those businesses. In addition, securities, pension, and other authorities oversee our investment and pension companies where they operate. Regulators also subject our non-U.S. insurance businesses to current and developing solvency regimes, which impose various capital and other requirements. Additionally, regulators may enhance their capital standards and supervision, and impose additional non-U.S. and global regulatory initiatives.\nSet forth below is a summary of the material regulatory frameworks applicable to MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nU.S. Federal Initiatives\nU.S. federal initiatives can affect our business in a variety of ways, including regulation of financial services, securities, derivatives, pensions, health care, money laundering, foreign sanctions and corrupt practices, and taxation. \nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) increased the federal role in regulating businesses such as ours, including in the following ways:\n•    The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) may designate certain financial companies that pose a threat to U.S. financial stability as non-bank systemically important financial institutions (“non-bank SIFI”) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n•    The Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Department of the Treasury may participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., collect information about the insurance industry, and recommend prudential standards.\n•    If an entity such as MetLife, Inc. or another non-insurance financial institution faces insolvency or threat of default significantly impacting U.S. financial stability, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) could liquidate it as a receiver. In that case, the Bankruptcy Code, which ordinarily governs liquidations, would not apply. The FDIC’s purpose would be mitigating the systemic risks the institution’s failure poses, rather than adhering to traditional bankruptcy objectives, possibly resulting in different creditor treatment. However, state insurance laws would continue to apply to an insurance company resolution.\n•    Dodd-Frank provisions may also affect the investments and investment activities of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including imposing federal regulation of such activities.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIn 2023, the FSOC adopted final guidance establishing a new process for designating certain financial companies as non-bank SIFIs. This revised approach evaluates risk factors such as leverage, liquidity risk and maturity mismatch, interconnections, operational risks, complexity, or opacity, inadequate risk management, concentration, and destabilizing activities, regardless of whether those risks arise from activities, firms, or otherwise. Under the guidance, the FSOC is no longer required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and an assessment of the likelihood of a non-bank financial company’s material financial distress before considering the designation of the company. The revised process could have the effect of simplifying and shortening FSOC’s procedures for designating certain financial companies as non-bank SIFIs, thereby subjecting such companies to additional supervision, examination, and regulation. Any such designation would create uncertainties for the non-bank financial company regarding the likelihood, frequency or impact of any formal or informal regulatory or supervisory actions or inquiries; the scope of applicable regulatory or supervisory requirements or restrictions and the related compliance measures and internal controls; and the permissibility of certain activities or transactions. It is difficult to predict the potential impact of these changes. \nThe Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act amended the McCarran-Ferguson Act, extending U.S. antitrust laws to encompass the “business of health insurance” and broadening U.S. regulatory authority accordingly. Consequently, we anticipate increased regulatory oversight and litigation risk for U.S. products, including dental and vision. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\nHealth Care Regulation\nDemand for and pricing of products is subject to tax uncertainty. Federal health care statutes and corresponding regulations have increased costs unpredictably for certain products and may have additional adverse effects. They have also harmed our competitive position, as these rules have a disparate impact on our products compared to products offered by our not-for-profit competitors. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\nU.S. Insurance Holding Company Regulation\nWe are subject to U.S. state insurance holding company laws and regulations that are generally based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (“NAIC”) Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation. These vary by jurisdiction, but generally require a controlled insurance company (an insurer that is a subsidiary of an insurance holding company) to register and file reports with state regulatory authorities about its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions, and general business operations. Furthermore, state holding company laws require the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer to file an annual enterprise risk report with the lead state of the insurance holding company system. This report identifies risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Each of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states has implemented these requirements. The holding company laws also authorize state insurance commissioners to act as global group-wide supervisors for internationally active insurance groups (“IAIGs”). All states have adopted laws and regulations enhancing group-wide supervision.\nState Insurance Regulation \nEach of MetLife’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in its jurisdiction of domicile and/or in each jurisdiction where it conducts insurance business. The extent of insurance regulation in such jurisdictions varies, but most jurisdictions regulate the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers through broad administrative powers, including: (i) licensing companies and agents to transact business; (ii) regulating certain premium rates; (iii) reviewing and approving certain policy forms, including required policyholder disclosures; (iv) establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; and (v) with respect to jurisdictions of domicile, restricting dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries must file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulators in each jurisdiction where it does business. Such authorities will periodically examine their books, records, accounts, and business practices. In 2019, MetLife entered into a consent order with the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) relating to unclaimed property following an open market conduct quinquennial exam, under which it paid a fine and customer restitution, and submitted remediation plans for approval. Except for this consent order and other items as described in Note 24 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, MetLife did not receive any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of its insurance subsidiaries.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOrganizations like the NAIC encourage insurance supervisors to establish Supervisory Colleges to facilitate cooperation among insurance supervisors to enhance their understanding of risk profiles of U.S.-based insurance groups with international operations. MetLife’s lead state regulator, the NYDFS, annually chairs Supervisory College meetings that MetLife’s key U.S. and non-U.S. regulators attend.\nSurplus and Capital\nInsurers must maintain their capital and surplus at or above minimum levels set in their respective jurisdictions. Regulators possess discretionary authority to limit or prohibit an insurer’s sales to policyholders if the insurer fails to meet these standards or if they find that the further transaction of business would be hazardous to policyholders. For developments that could affect our ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings results, and thus our surplus and capital, see “Risk Factors.”\nDividend Restrictions\nState insurance statutes typically restrict the dividends or other distributions an insurance company subsidiary may pay to its parent company and limit transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. Dividends exceeding prescribed limits and transactions above a specified size between an insurer and its affiliates require domiciliary insurance regulator approval. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MetLife, Inc. — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.” See also “Dividend Restrictions” in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding such limitations.\nRisk-Based Capital\nMost of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. RBC is calculated annually based on a formula that considers various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items, reflecting asset, insurance, interest rate, and market and business risk characteristics. Regulators use this formula as an early warning tool to identify inadequately capitalized insurers. See “Statutory Equity and Income” in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Statutory Capital and Dividends.”\nWe calculate our internally defined “Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio” by dividing the sum of total adjusted capital for MetLife, Inc.’s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life Insurance Company (“American Life”), by the sum of company action level RBC for such subsidiaries, including annual Special Considerations Letters (“SCL\"), as discussed below. Our Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was \nin excess of 360%\n and \nin excess of 380%\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. By contrast, we calculate an “NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio” based on such subsidiaries’ statutory-based financial statements and NAIC capital and reserving standards. This NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 380% and in excess of 400% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nNAIC developments related to the RBC framework are described below.\n•    RBC Revisions. The NAIC approved an RBC update for mortality risk that took effect at year-end 2022, which had a modest positive impact on our reported RBC ratios. In 2023, the NAIC increased the RBC factor for structured security residual tranches from 30% to 45%, which became effective for year-end 2024 RBC filings and had an immaterial impact on RBC. The NAIC is currently reviewing the RBC treatment of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). See “— Investments” for additional information.\n•    Bond Project. The NAIC adopted a new, principles-based definition of a bond that became effective in certain statutory accounting guidance as of January 1, 2025. This will result in new reporting and disclosure requirements, and will lead to categorical changes associated with these investments in the regulatory reports. These changes are not expected to have a material impact on RBC.\n•    Interest Maintenance Reserve. In 2023, the NAIC adopted an interim solution with regard to the treatment of an insurer’s negative interest maintenance reserve (“IMR”) balance, which may occur in a rising interest rate environment and can impact how accurately the insurer’s surplus and financial strength are captured in its statutory financial statements due to lower surplus and RBC ratios. The NAIC’s interim statutory accounting guidance is effective until December 31, 2025 and permits an insurer with a company action level RBC ratio greater than 150% (or an authorized control level RBC ratio greater than 300%) to admit negative IMR up to 10% of its general account capital and surplus, subject to certain restrictions and reporting obligations. These interim changes had an immaterial impact on RBC. The NAIC is developing a long-term solution for this issue.\n14\nTable of Contents\n•\nGroup Capital Calculation. The NAIC’s group capital calculation (“GCC”) tool uses an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within an insurance holding company system, including non-U.S. entities. The annual GCC filing requirement is now mandated by the majority of states, including New York, our lead state regulator, and most of our U.S. subsidiaries’ domiciliary states. We cannot predict what impact this regulatory tool may have on our business.\nInvestments\nState insurance laws and regulations limit how much our U.S. insurance subsidiaries can invest in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, real estate equity, other equity investments, and derivatives, and require diversification of investment portfolios. Investments exceeding regulatory limitations are not admitted for purposes of measuring surplus. In some instances, laws require us to divest any non-qualifying investments.\nThe NAIC is focused on enhancing regulatory oversight of insurers’ investments in complex assets, such as structured securities. In connection with evaluating the risks of investing in leveraged loans and CLOs, the NAIC Purposes and Procedures Manual provides that the NAIC Structured Securities Group (“SSG”) will assign risk weights to CLOs using its own modeling rather than credit ratings. The SSG will model CLO investments and evaluate tranche-level losses across all debt tranches under various collateral stress scenarios to minimize RBC arbitrage. The NAIC’s goal is to ensure that the aggregate RBC factor for owning all tranches of a CLO is similar to that required for owning all of the underlying loan collateral. Insurers are required to begin reporting the financially modeled NAIC designations for CLOs with their year-end 2025 financial statement filings. The NAIC is collaborating with interested parties to refine the process for modeling CLO investments.\nIn addition, many of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries and pension companies are subject to other investment laws and regulations. \nReserves and Asset Adequacy Analysis\nThe NAIC’s valuation manual contains a principle-based approach to the calculation of life insurance reserves. Principle-based reserving, which is designed to better address reserving for life insurance and annuity products, has been adopted by all states. \nIn early 2024, the NAIC launched an initiative to address declines in reserve requirements following certain offshore reinsurance transactions, which could lead the NAIC to propose higher reserve requirements for cedants that are parties to certain offshore reinsurance treaties. \nWe use capital markets solutions through captives to fund a portion of our statutory reserve requirements for several products, such as level premium term life products and MLIC’s closed block, which are subject to the NAIC’s Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX), and universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees subject to NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (commonly referred to as Guideline AXXX). NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG 48”) enhances the statutory financial statement disclosure of an insurer's use of captives and narrows permissible assets backing statutory reserves. The NAIC’s Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation codifies the same substantive requirements as AG 48. States must either adopt the model regulation or use AG 48 to satisfy the NAIC accreditation requirement.\nEach year a qualified actuary must submit an opinion stating that the statutory reserves of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of such subsidiary. We may increase reserves in order to submit this opinion without qualification. \nIn addition, the NYDFS issues SCLs to New York-licensed insurance companies, including MLIC, that affect year-end asset adequacy testing. An SCL could mandate assumption changes that would require us to increase, or influence our decision to release, certain asset adequacy reserves, which could materially impact our statutory capital and surplus. See “Statutory Equity and Income” in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMany of our non-U.S. insurance operations must also analyze the adequacy of their statutory reserves. In most of those cases, a locally qualified actuary must submit an adequacy analysis, although regulatory and actuarial analytic standards vary widely. \n15\nTable of Contents\nAdjusting Non-Guaranteed Elements of Life Insurance Products\nNew York’s Insurance Regulation 210 sets standards for the determination and any readjustment of non-guaranteed elements (“NGEs”) that may vary at the insurer’s discretion for life insurance policies and annuity contracts delivered or issued for delivery in New York. NGEs include cost of insurance for universal life insurance policies, as well as interest crediting rates for annuities and universal life insurance policies. The regulation requires insurers to notify policyholders in advance of any change in NGEs that is adverse to policyholders and, with respect to life insurance, to notify the NYDFS prior to any such changes. The regulation generally prohibits insurers from increasing profit margins for in-force policies or adjusting NGEs in order to recoup past losses.\nGuaranty Associations\nMany jurisdictions require our insurance subsidiaries to participate in guaranty associations that pay insurance benefits owed by insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments on member insurers based on the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer engaged. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate.\nCertain Non-U.S. Regulations\nRegulators supervise our non-U.S. insurance and pension businesses through periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority along with European legislation, requires European regulators, such as the Central Bank of Ireland, to establish supervisory forums for European Economic Area (“EEA”)-based insurance groups with significant European operations, including MetLife. These forums facilitate cooperation and coordination among European supervisors to enhance their understanding of an insurance group’s risk profile.\nNon-U.S. jurisdictions also restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions from subsidiaries and remittances from branches. For example, a portion of the annual earnings of our Japan operations may be repatriated each year, and may further be distributed to MetLife, Inc. as a dividend. We may determine not to repatriate profits from the Japan operations or to repatriate a reduced amount in order to maintain or improve the solvency of the Japan operations or for other reasons. In addition, the Financial Services Agency in Japan (“FSA”) may limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of our Japan operations or for other reasons.\nSolvency Regimes\nOur EEA insurance business is subject to the Solvency II Directive, governing capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting. Solvency II harmonizes insurance regulation across the European Union (“EU”). Its capital requirements are forward-looking and based on the risk profile of each individual insurance company in order to promote comparability, transparency and competitiveness.\nThe U.K. and EU have completed reviews of their solvency regimes. The new U.K. rules were effective at the end of 2024. For the EU, we expect detailed guidance to be completed in 2025, with compliance beginning in 2027.\nMexico has adopted a Solvency II-type regulatory framework which imposes reserve and capital requirements and corporate governance to foster transparency. In line with the requirements of the local Solvency II, insurance companies calculate and report their capital requirement using a standard formula designed by the local regulators (“CNSF”). In addition, as required, certain MetLife entities must submit annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) reports to the CNSF on an ongoing basis. \nIn Chile, the law implementing Solvency II-like regulation continues in the studies stage. The implementation date for the new solvency regime has not yet been set; however, it could be in force within four years after the final regulation is published. MetLife Chile must also submit an annual ORSA report to the regulator.\nThe Brazilian insurance regulator has established an insurance framework for minimum capital requirements based on risk, criteria for investment activities, a formal risk management function, and a formal enterprise risk management (“ERM”) framework.\nJapanese law requires insurers to maintain solvency standards to protect policyholders and to support their own financial strength. Most Japanese life insurers maintain a solvency margin ratio well in excess of the legally mandated minimum. In addition, we expect Japan to adopt an economic value-based solvency regime in 2025.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn China, the business of our joint venture (as well as the industry) has implemented China Risk Oriented Solvency System (“C-ROSS”), a risk-based solvency regime. Like Solvency II, C-ROSS focuses on risk management and has three pillars (strengthen quantitative capital requirements, enhance qualitative supervision and establish a governance and market discipline process). In 2021, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CBIRC”) issued C-ROSS Phase II rules, further enhancing the C-ROSS system. CBIRC has adopted a transition period approach based on actual circumstances, with full implementation to be in place by no later than 2026. In 2023, China’s State Council created the National Financial Regulatory Administration (“NFRA”) to oversee regulation of the financial sector. NFRA has replaced its predecessor, CBIRC.\nKorea’s Financial Supervisory Service implemented a new solvency system in 2023. This system reflects the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) global Insurance Capital Standard and incorporates certain product portfolio and other features specific to the Korean market and includes mark-to-market valuation.\nIAIS\nThe IAIS is a voluntary membership association of insurance supervisors and regulators. It is the global standard-setting body responsible for developing and assisting in the implementation of principles, standards and guidance, as well as supporting material, for the supervision of the insurance sector. As a member of the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), the IAIS helps to manage systemic risk globally. The IAIS’s holistic framework assesses and mitigates systemic risk in the global insurance sector. The framework monitors vulnerabilities at jurisdictional and global levels to address any such risk through the application of enhanced supervisory measures based on existing insurance core principles and the common framework for supervision of IAIGs. In 2022, the FSB endorsed this framework and stopped designating global systemically important insurers.\nAn IAIS proposal becomes effective when it is enacted through legislation or regulation in the applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the impact on MetLife, Inc. of the IAIS’s global proposals is uncertain.\nCybersecurity, Privacy and Data Protection, and Innovation and Technology Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations at the local, state, federal and international levels regarding the handling of personal information, including health-related and customer information and employee data. Various laws in the U.S. and globally require companies such as ours to inform individuals of their privacy rights. Our personal information processing practices further dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we may transfer, process or receive personal information, the interpretation and scope of which are constantly evolving and vary significantly across jurisdictions. Furthermore, we must comply with laws and regulations governing the security and integrity of our information systems, many of which require comprehensive information security programs, and mandatory notifications to affected individuals and regulators in the event of security breaches and other cyber incidents. Increasing cybersecurity risks and threats from various actors have increased regulatory focus on cybersecurity practices, and regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and cybersecurity continues to increase worldwide. Below, we highlight some of the key data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nCybersecurity\nThe NYDFS promulgated the New York Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies (the “Regulation”) to promote the protection of customer information and information technology. Entities under the NYDFS’s jurisdiction, such as our insurance entities licensed in New York, must conduct risk assessments of their information systems and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such systems and data. The Regulation mandates, among other things: (i) technical safeguards and controls relating to the governance framework for a cybersecurity program; (ii) risk-based policies, procedures and minimum standards for technology systems for data protection; (iii) minimum standards for cyber breach responses, including notice to the NYDFS of certain material events; (iv) designation of a Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”); (v) oversight of third party service providers; and (vi) identification and documentation of material deficiencies, remediation plans and annual certifications of regulatory compliance. Covered entities that fail to comply with the Regulation may be subject to NYDFS enforcement actions, the result of which could lead to civil penalties, and other legal and reputational costs.\nIn 2023, the NYDFS adopted amendments to the Regulation, including: (a) implementing additional governance and oversight measures; (b) expanding the types of cybersecurity events that require timely notification to the NYDFS; (c) mandating notifications to the NYDFS within 24 hours of a cyber-ransom payment; and (d) requiring enhancements to written policies and procedures related to remote access, vulnerability management, data retention and access privileges. The majority of the new requirements became effective in 2024. We cannot predict what effect the amended Regulation will have on our business or compliance costs.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe NAIC’s Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “Cybersecurity Model Law”) requires insurers to develop and maintain a risk-based information security program, establish data security standards and notify insurance commissioners of certain cybersecurity events. Certain of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states have adopted the Cybersecurity Model Law, and more may adopt it in the future. Additional compliance efforts may present an increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nIn the U.S., we are subject to state laws imposing obligations on the processing of personal information and providing consumers specific rights over such information. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices and gives California residents expanded rights with respect to the processing of their personal information. In 2020, the CCPA was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, imposing additional rights and obligations. While a significant portion of our business is exempted from the CCPA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other state insurance laws to which we are subject grant similar rights to insureds.\nAdditional states either have proposed or adopted new comprehensive privacy laws, which may apply to certain portions of our business. However, several of these state laws include broad entity-wide exemptions for financial institutions. The NAIC is also developing amendments to update its Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Regulation (Model 672). The proposed amendments, which are expected to be finalized in 2025, are expected to expand the definition of nonpublic personal information; add consumer rights to request access, correction and deletion of nonpublic personal information; and add requirements for contracts with third-party service providers. \nOutside of the U.S., our subsidiaries are subject to various data protection regimes, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), which imposes strict requirements for controllers and processors of personal data and on transfers of personal data outside of the EEA to countries which have not been deemed “adequate” by the European Commission.\nFollowing the U.K.’s exit from the EU, data privacy law in the U.K. includes the GDPR as assimilated (formally retained) in U.K. law. The interpretation of the U.K. GDPR may eventually start to differ from the GDPR, and ensuring compliance with each is, and will remain, an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs. We are also subject to increasingly restrictive laws in other jurisdictions that address and impose strict requirements on cross-border data transfers.\nInnovation and Technology\nAs a result of increased innovation and technology, the NAIC and insurance regulators are focused on the use of “big data” techniques, such as the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning and automated decision-making. In 2023, the NAIC’s Innovation, Cybersecurity and Technology (H) Committee (the “(H) Committee”) adopted the Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers (the “AI Bulletin”). States have started to adopt the AI Bulletin, which outlines how insurance regulators should govern the development, acquisition and use of AI technologies, as well as the types of information that regulators may request during an investigation or examination of an insurer in regard to AI systems. The (H) Committee has also formed a new task force that is charged with creating a regulatory framework for the oversight of insurers’ use of third-party data and models.\nFurther, the NAIC and state insurance regulators have been focused on addressing unfair discrimination in the use of consumer data and technology, and some states have passed laws targeting unfair discrimination practices. In 2024, the NYDFS released its circular letter, which applies to all authorized insurers in New York, such as MLIC and Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company. The circular letter provides guidance on how insurers should develop and manage their use of external consumer data and AI systems in underwriting and pricing so as not to harm consumers.\nWe expect big data and AI technologies to remain important issues for the NAIC and state and international regulators. We cannot predict which insurance regulators will adopt the AI Bulletin, or what, if any, changes to laws or regulations may be enacted with regard to “big data” or AI technologies in the U.S. or outside of the U.S. For example, the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (“EU AI Act”) became effective in 2024. Among other things, the EU AI Act prohibits certain “unacceptable” AI practices while seeking to boost innovation and ensure fundamental rights are not infringed by the technology. We continue to monitor the developments of the EU AI Act and other governmental initiatives around the world, particularly in jurisdictions where we operate.\n18\nTable of Contents\nStandards of Conduct, ERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation\nWe provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). ERISA and the Code impose restrictions, including fiduciary duties to perform solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and to avoid prohibited non-exempt transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\nThe prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and to Individual Retirement Accounts (and certain other arrangements) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen, unless an exemption or exception is available. Similarly, without an exemption or exception, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.\nIn 2021, the DOL’s final version of the prohibited transaction exemption (“PTE”) 2020-02 went into effect, which allows investment advice fiduciaries to receive compensation without violating ERISA, subject to impartial conduct standards and disclosure obligations aligned with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules. In the preamble to PTE 2020-02, the DOL also provided its interpretation of the five-part test used to determine whether a person is acting as an ERISA investment advice fiduciary. In April 2024, DOL finalized and published a regulation to change the definition of “fiduciary” for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code, when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, and in July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of “fiduciary” and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. The DOL has appealed these stay orders. We are evaluating the potential impact of these developments on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance, annuity and welfare benefit products to retirement investors. \nFederal and state securities regulators have adopted standards of conduct when recommending securities, including variable insurance products. The SEC’s Regulation Best Interest requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail consumers when recommending account types, securities transactions or investment strategies involving securities, including recommendations to individuals receiving recommendations about their retirement accounts. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) rules impose requirements on broker-dealers relating to the sale of variable insurance products. \nState regulators and legislatures have proposed measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents, and investment advisers and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to customers. The North American Securities Administrators Association has proposed revisions to its broker-dealer conduct model rule intended to apply Regulation Best Interest at the state level and prohibiting the use of the terms “advisor” or “adviser” without being registered as an investment adviser. Although Regulation Best Interest does not include a private right of action, some of the state proposals and adopted regulations would allow for a private right of action. As a result of these developments, it is possible that it may become more costly to provide and distribute our products and services, and that we might be subject to additional litigation and regulatory investigations regarding our compliance with those rules.\nIn January 2025, the Chilean Congress approved a major pension reform bill, which improves pensions by increasing employer contributions, correcting certain inequalities, raising the guaranteed minimum pension and modifying Chile’s Pension Fund Administrators system to allow new pension fund administrators into the market. The impact of such pension reform on our Chilean pension business is being assessed.\n19\nTable of Contents\nManagement of Climate Risk and ESG\nClimate risk has come under increased scrutiny by regulators and the NAIC. In New York, the NYDFS expects both New York domestic insurers, such as MLIC, and foreign authorized insurers, such as our other insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, to manage material climate risks by taking actions that are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of their businesses. However, the NYDFS issued separate guidance for New York domestic insurers, which contains more detailed expectations, such as (i) ensuring the board of directors understands relevant climate risks; (ii) performing regular reviews of the insurer’s procedures that are designed to manage climate risks; (iii) using scenario analysis to inform the insurer’s business strategies and risk assessment; and (iv) incorporating material climate risks into its financial risk management (e.g., ERM and ORSA). In addition, New York’s regulation governing ERM, which applies to New York domestic and foreign authorized insurers, was amended to require an insurance group’s ERM function to address climate change risk.\nThe NAIC has adopted a standard for insurance companies to report their climate-related risks as part of its annual Climate Risk Disclosure Survey, which applies to insurers that meet the reporting threshold of $100 million in countrywide direct premium and are licensed in one of the participating jurisdictions. The new disclosure standard is consistent with the international Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures’ framework for reporting climate-related financial information. \nPursuant to its authority under Dodd-Frank, the FIO is also assessing how the insurance sector may mitigate climate risks and help achieve national climate-related goals. In 2023, the FIO released a report which urges insurance regulators to adopt climate-related risk-monitoring guidance in order to enhance their regulation and supervision of insurers. \nThe SEC is also focused on climate, and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) risks and opportunities. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring registrants to provide additional climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports, including in their financial statements. In April 2024, following litigation challenging the final rules, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rules pending completion of judicial review. In 2022, the SEC also proposed rules requiring registered investment companies, business development companies, and registered and certain unregistered investment advisers to disclose in their fund prospectuses, annual reports and Form ADV information about how funds and advisers incorporate ESG factors into their investment strategies.\nIn 2023, California adopted laws establishing climate disclosure and climate-related financial risk reporting requirements which apply to companies doing business in California that meet applicable revenue thresholds. Also in 2023, California adopted a law establishing disclosure requirements for entities operating within California that market, sell, purchase, or use voluntary carbon offsets, as well as those that make claims of achieving net zero emissions or carbon neutrality that operate within and make such claims within the state. MetLife is in compliance with such requirements.\nThe EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) requires in-scope companies to report on (i) how sustainability issues might create financial risks for the company; and (ii) the company’s impacts on people and the environment. CSRD applies on a staggered basis to companies, over a multi-year period, with the first reports due in 2025 in respect of the 2024 financial year. MetLife’s largest insurance subsidiary in Europe is in scope for this first phase.\nConsumer Protection Laws\nAs part of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction generally exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate non-insurance consumer services we provide. Consumer protection laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions may also affect us.\nDerivatives Regulation and Clearing of Treasury Securities\nDodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets requiring clearing of certain OTC derivative transactions and imposes additional costs, including reporting and margin requirements. Centralized clearing also exposes us to the risk of a default by a clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions. \n20\nTable of Contents\nDodd-Frank also expanded the definition of “swap” and mandated the SEC and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to study whether “stable value contracts” should be treated as swaps. Pursuant to the definition and the SEC’s and CFTC’s interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries, other than stable value contracts, might also be treated as swaps. Special federal banking rules apply to certain derivatives contracts and other agreements with some banking institutions and certain of their affiliates. These rules generally limit or delay the rights of counterparties upon the insolvency of such banking institutions which could increase our counterparty risk.\nIn 2024, the principal U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies reproposed for public comment regulations to implement certain international “Basel III” capital standards, which could affect capital charges applicable to banks and their affiliates engaged in derivatives activities. This could increase the costs of our risk mitigation using derivatives, as well as impact the availability of derivatives from our counterparties.\nIn 2023, the SEC adopted rules to require that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require every direct participant of the agency to submit for clearing eligible secondary market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities. The rule effectively requires such participants to clear eligible cash transactions in U.S. Treasury securities beginning on December 31, 2025. Furthermore, the rule effectively requires eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury securities to be cleared beginning on June 30, 2026. As a result, certain transactions between such participants and us will be required to be cleared. The rule’s potential effect on the U.S. Treasury markets is uncertain.\nSecurities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\nU.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that meet the definition of a “security,” including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, and certain fixed interest rate or index-linked contracts with features that require them to be registered as securities or exempt from registration. As a result, some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under these securities laws.\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered “securities” under local law, and we may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.\nSome of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies with separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) or are exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act. Such separate accounts are generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies associated with these separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or are exempt from registration under the Securities Act. One of our insurance subsidiaries issues a fixed interest rate contract with features that require it to be registered under the Securities Act.\nCertain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws.\nTwo of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. The SEC, CFTC and FINRA from time to time propose and adopt rules and regulations that impact broker-dealers and products deemed to be securities. One of our U.S. broker-dealers serves as the principal underwriter and distributor of these variable products and other securities offerings. Our broker-dealer distributes these products via unaffiliated third-party broker-dealers and financial intermediaries that sell these products to end investors. Under SEC rules, these selling broker-dealers are required to comply with various SEC and FINRA rules and regulations, including Regulation Best Interest. SEC rules also require these selling broker-dealers to disclose the nature of services, their standard of conduct, and their conflicts of interest to their retail customers. With regard to insurance products, the NAIC revised its Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation to add a “best interest” standard for the sale of annuities. All of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states have adopted the model regulation or another form of the best interest standard.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOne of our U.S. subsidiaries is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. In addition, we have non-U.S. subsidiaries that are registered or licensed in non-U.S. jurisdictions to conduct our investment management business. We may also be subject to similar laws and regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions with respect to the provision of investment advisory services or the conducting of other activities.\nFederal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.\nDiversity and Corporate Governance\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators are evaluating issues related to diversity within the insurance industry. In New York, for example, the NYDFS expects insurers to make diversity of their leadership a business priority and a key element of their corporate governance, and it includes diversity-related questions in its examination process.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nAs an owner and operator of real property in many jurisdictions, we are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations in such jurisdictions, as well as the associated risks of environmental liabilities. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies that could potentially be subject to such liabilities. We routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nUnclaimed Property\nWe are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. See “— State Insurance Regulation,” which references a consent order. See also Note 24 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBrighthouse Separation Tax Treatment\nPrior to the spin-off distribution of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Brighthouse”) common stock in 2017, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain significant issues under the Code, as well as an opinion from tax counsel that the distribution qualified for non-recognition of gain or loss to us and our shareholders pursuant to Sections 355 and 361 of the Code, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares, each subject to the accuracy of and compliance with certain representations, assumptions and covenants therein.\nNotwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the tax opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction, for example, if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or covenants on which the private letter ruling is based are untrue or have been violated. Similarly, the IRS could determine that our disposal of the fair value option of Brighthouse Financial, Inc.’s common stock in the debt-for-equity exchange should be treated as a taxable transaction to MetLife, Inc. Furthermore, as part of the IRS’s policy, the IRS did not determine whether the distribution or the debt-for-equity exchange satisfies certain conditions that are necessary to qualify for non-recognition treatment. Rather, the private letter ruling is based on representations by us and Brighthouse that these conditions have been satisfied. The tax opinion addressed the satisfaction of these conditions. The tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or a court may take a contrary position. In addition, the tax counsel relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by us and Brighthouse.\nIf the IRS ultimately determines that the distribution is taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to MetLife shareholders who received shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock in the distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and such shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if the 2017 tax year is still open with respect to such shareholders under the applicable statute of limitation. In addition, if the IRS ultimately determines that the distribution is taxable, we and Brighthouse could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and either we or Brighthouse could have an indemnification obligation to the other, depending on the circumstances.\nEven if the spin-off distribution otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 of the Code, it may be taxable to us, but not our shareholders, under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more (by vote or value) of our common stock or Brighthouse Financial, Inc.’s common stock is acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution.\n22\nTable of Contents\nCross-Border Trade and Investments\nThe U.S., the EU and the U.K. maintain and enforce a variety of economic sanctions against designated countries and their nationals around the world, which can result in disruptions in cross-border activity. In particular, U.S., EU and U.K. sanctions on Russia have expanded as a result of the war in Ukraine. These sanctions have expanded restrictions on transactions with the Russian Central Bank and other specified Russian government entities, dealing in Russian sovereign debt, engaging in certain debt and equity transactions, and engaging in transactions related to all new investment in the Russian Federation. Trade and investment in China may also be impacted by U.S. sanctions, outbound investment controls, and tariff policies. The U.S. government has previously issued restrictions targeting certain activity involving specified Chinese securities and technology.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed policies aiming to modernize global tax systems, including a global 15% minimum effective tax rate (“Pillar Two”) for multinational companies, including MetLife. A number of countries have either enacted Pillar Two rules or are evaluating whether to enact such rules. As most of our operations are in jurisdictions with a tax rate above 15%, we do not currently expect these rules to have a material impact on us.\nCompetition \nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Competitive Pressures.” We face competition based on factors such as service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition, performance against ESG metrics, technology, changes in regulation and taxes and other factors. We compete globally with a large number of insurance companies and non-insurance financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers. We compete for individual consumers, employer and other group customers, as well as agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of our competitors offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability ratings. In the U.S. and Japan, we compete with a large number of domestic and foreign-owned life insurance companies, many of which offer products in categories on which we focus. Elsewhere, we compete with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies. Because we and others underwrite many group insurance products annually, our group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than renewing coverage with us.\nInsurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. They are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue focusing on monetization of assets, and fee-based services. They are also looking for opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions which include value-added services along with traditional products.\nFinancial market volatility will impact insurers’ capital positions, which may strain the competitive environment and lead to industry consolidation. We believe adaptability to market changes, as well as financial strength, technological efficiency and organizational agility, will most significantly differentiate competitors in our industry. We believe we are well positioned to succeed in any environment. \nThe Company distributes many of its products through a variety of third-party distribution channels, including banks and broker-dealers. We believe potential distribution partners carefully consider the financial strength of the company whose products they sell. Bank and broker-dealer consolidation could increase competition for access to distributors. \nWe face intense competition for employees. We must attract and retain highly skilled people with knowledge of our business and industry experience to support our business. See “— Human Capital Resources.” We continue to seek to grow our career agency forces in selected global markets. We also continue efforts to enhance the efficiency and production of our sales representatives. These initiatives may not succeed in attracting and retaining productive agents. See “— Segments and Corporate & Other” for information on sales distribution.\nNumerous aspects of our business are heavily regulated. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can affect our competitive position within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See “— Regulation.”\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2024, we had approximately 45,000 employees. \n23\nTable of Contents\nAs a financial services company, meeting our business objectives requires that we rely significantly on our global workforce, leveraging a wide variety of professional, technical, management, business, and other skills and expertise, to create value for our stakeholders.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and the Company’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to our performance measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, that are not based on GAAP. See “— Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures” for definitions and a discussion of these and other financial measures, and “— Results of Operations” and “— Investments” for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nFor information relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with the year ended December 31, 2022, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in MetLife, Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nConsolidated Company Outlook \nAt the December 2024 Investor Day, we introduced our New Frontier five-year strategy which is designed to accelerate growth across our global platform while delivering attractive returns and all-weather performance. Our New Frontier strategy builds upon the success of our five-year Next Horizon strategy, which we announced in 2019, with an aim to focus, simplify and differentiate the Company. \n Our outlook reflects continued uncertainty around inflation and unemployment in 2025. We expect the U.S. dollar to strengthen in 2025 compared to 2024. \nBased on the forward yield curve as of December 31, 2024, we expect long-term interest rates to remain stable in 2025 with the yield curve steepening, as short-term interest rates decline. We believe that our investment portfolio is highly diversified and positioned to perform well in a variety of economic scenarios. See “— Industry Trends — Impact of Market Interest Rates” for discussion of the mitigating actions the Company has taken to reduce interest rate sensitivity, as market interest rates are a key driver of our results.\n As of December 31, 2024, we had $5.1 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding companies which is above the high end of our $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion holding company cash target. In 2025, we expect to maintain this holding company cash target. We have also returned a total of approximately $21.0 billion to shareholders from 2020 through 2024, and we expect to generate approximately $25.0 billion in free cash flow over the next five years.\nOur continued capital stress testing and longstanding commitment to liquidity position us to withstand a variety of economic conditions. We do not expect any material liquidity deficiencies, and we expect to remain able to comply with the financial covenants of our credit agreements. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.” We will continue reviewing accounting estimates, asset valuations and various financial scenarios for capital and liquidity implications. See “— Investments — Current Environment” and “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nAssuming (i) interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves as of December 31, 2024, including a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of 4.69% at December 31, 2025, (ii) S&P 500 equity index annual return of 5%, and (iii) private equity annual returns between 9% to 11% over the near-term, we expect to maintain the two-year average annual ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items, at 65% to 75%. \nFurther, based on the aforementioned assumptions, we (i) increased our target for adjusted return on equity\n1\n, excluding total notable items, from 13%-15% to 15%-17%, and (ii) established a new target of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, excluding total notable items, over the near-term. \n46\nTable of Contents\nBased on our continued focus on expense discipline and our overall efficiency mindset, we lowered our full year direct expense ratio target, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers, from 12.3% to (i) 12.1% over the near-term and (ii) 11.3% over the New Frontier period.\nOur outlook relies on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. We continually review our assumptions, implement mitigation plans, and take precautions. We may revise our outlook as we obtain more information regarding economic conditions, regulatory changes, and other events, and the impact of these events on our business operations, investment portfolio, derivatives, financial results and financial condition.\n__________________\n1\nBeginning with fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and going forward, “adjusted return on equity” refers to return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) other than foreign currency translation adjustments (“FCTA”) and certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives. \nIndustry Trends\nWe continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry.\nFinancial and Economic Environment\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally due to our market presence in numerous countries, our large investment portfolio and the sensitivity of our insurance liabilities and derivatives to changing market factors. \nWe are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives, such as global inflation, supply chain disruptions, acts of war and banking sector volatility. We are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs, sanctions or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “— Impact of Market Interest Rates — Effects of Inflation,” and “— Investments — Current Environment.”\nGovernments and central banks around the world use fiscal and monetary policies to address uncertain economic conditions. In the U.S., the Federal Open Market Committee took various actions in 2024 to promote economic stability, including lowering interest rates during the second half of the year. Labor market conditions, inflation and financial and international developments, as well as other factors, could affect the continuation of such actions in 2025. The European Central Bank and Bank of England have also recently lowered interest rates, but forecasts for 2025 are uncertain due to risks to economic growth and global trade. The Bank of Japan raised interest rates in January 2025 taking the policy rate to its highest level since 2008.\nImpact of Market Interest Rates\nMarket interest rates are a key driver of our results. Increases and decreases in such rates, as well as extended periods of stagnation, may impact our business and investments in various ways.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that while inflation has not had a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates, both rising interest rates and inflation will have a neutral to modestly favorable impact on our business. We expect that a lower interest rate environment, however, will have a modestly unfavorable impact on our business. See “— Impact of a Rising Interest Rate Environment,” “— Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment,” and “— Interest Rate Scenarios.”\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. In our group life and disability businesses, premiums increase as compensation levels of our customers’ employees increase. However, during inflationary periods with rising interest rates, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses, resulting in additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other costs, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\n47\nTable of Contents\nImpact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment\nSustained periods of low U.S. interest rates may cause us to:\n•\nReduce the difference between interest credited to policyholders and interest earned on supporting assets (“gross margin”); \n•\nReinvest investment proceeds in lower yielding assets and experience higher frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio;\n•\nIncrease our reserves related to policy liabilities and potentially impair intangible assets;\n•\nReduce interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values;\n•\nChange our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n•\nExperience changing policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nFor additional discussion on gross margin and interest rate assumptions, as well as the potential impact of low interest rates, see “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2023 — Actuarial Assumption Review”; “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Interest Rate Risks”; “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Be Required to Impair VOBA, VODA or VOCRA”; “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against Our Deferred Income Tax Assets”; and “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Face Volatility, Higher Risk Management Costs, and Increased Counterparty Risk Due to Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products.” \nImpact of a Rising Interest Rate Environment\nPeriods of rising U.S. interest rates may cause us to:\n•\nReinvest investment proceeds in higher yielding assets and experience lower frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio;\n•\nDecrease the value of our reserves related to policy liabilities;\n•\nIncrease interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values; and\n•\nChange our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix.\nFor additional discussion on the potential impact of rising interest rates, see “Risk Factors — Investment Risks — We May Change Our Securities and Investments Valuation, or Take Allowances and Impairments on Our Investments, or Change Our Methodologies, Estimations, and Assumptions.”\nManagement Actions\nTo manage the impact of a changing U.S. interest rate environment, we maintain diversification across products, distribution channels, and geographies while proactively evaluating interest rate and product strategies. In addition, we apply disciplined asset/liability management (“ALM”) strategies, including the use of derivatives. Our ability to take such actions may be limited by competition, regulatory approval requirements, or minimum crediting rate guarantees and may not match the timing or magnitude of interest rate changes.\nIn addition to proactive management strategies, businesses within our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments help alleviate impacts to our consolidated results given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity. \nFor additional discussion on interest rate risk management and our ability to change interest crediting rates or dividend scales, see “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Interest Rate Risks;” “— Risk Management;” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Management of Market Risk Exposures,” as well as Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n48\nTable of Contents\nInterest Rate Scenarios\nTo illustrate our sensitivity to U.S. interest rates, we compared the outcome of two hypothetical interest rate environments (the “Declining Interest Rate Scenario” and “Rising Interest Rate Scenario”) relative to our baseline economic assumptions (the “Base Scenario”) through 2027. \nThe Declining Interest Rate Scenario assumes U.S. interest rates for all maturities decline immediately on January 1, 2025 by 50 basis points compared to the Base Scenario through 2027. The Rising Interest Rate Scenario assumes U.S. interest rates rise immediately on January 1, 2025 by 50 basis points through 2027. Other than changing U.S. interest rates through 2027, all other economic assumptions are equivalent in the Base Scenario, Declining Interest Rate Scenario and Rising Interest Rate Scenario.\nThe following table compares the most relevant interest rate assumptions for the dates indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2025\n2026\n2027\nBase Scenario\nDeclining  \nInterest Rate Scenario\nRising Interest Rate Scenario\nBase Scenario\nDeclining  \nInterest Rate Scenario\nRising Interest Rate Scenario\nBase Scenario\nDeclining  \nInterest Rate Scenario\nRising Interest Rate Scenario\nSOFR\n3.90%\n3.40%\n4.40%\n3.87%\n3.37%\n4.37%\n3.93%\n3.43%\n4.43%\n10-year U.S. Treasury\n4.69%\n4.19%\n5.19%\n4.78%\n4.28%\n5.28%\n4.88%\n4.38%\n5.38%\n30-year U.S. Treasury\n4.82%\n4.32%\n5.32%\n4.84%\n4.34%\n5.34%\n4.87%\n4.37%\n5.37%\nHypothetical Impact to Net Derivative Gains (Losses), Market Risk Benefit Remeasurement (Gains) Losses and Adjusted Earnings\nWe estimate a net favorable impact to net derivative gains (losses) for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Declining Interest Rate Scenario. We hold significant positions in long-duration receive-fixed U.S. interest rate swaps, which are most sensitive to the 10-year and 30-year swap rates, to hedge reinvestment risk. We estimate a net unfavorable impact to net derivative gains (losses) for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Rising Interest Rate Scenario. \nWe estimate a net unfavorable impact to market risk benefit remeasurement (gains) losses for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Declining Interest Rate Scenario. Under the hypothetical Declining Interest Rate Scenario, we expect the market risk benefit (“MRB”) reserves to increase due to discounting the future cash flows at a lower rate. We estimate a net favorable impact to market risk benefit remeasurement (gains) losses for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Rising Interest Rate Scenario. Under the hypothetical Rising Interest Rate Scenario, we expect the MRB reserves to decrease due to discounting the future cash flows at a higher rate. \nWe estimate a net unfavorable impact to consolidated adjusted earnings for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Declining Interest Rate Scenario. The negative impact of reinvesting cash flows in lower yielding assets is partially offset by lowering interest crediting rates and dividend scales on products, and additional derivative income. We estimate a net favorable impact to consolidated adjusted earnings for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Rising Interest Rate Scenario. The positive impact of reinvesting cash flows in higher yielding assets is partially offset by increased interest crediting rates and dividend scales on products and lower derivative income. \n49\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on net derivative gains (losses), market risk benefit remeasurement (gains) losses and adjusted earnings for certain of our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, for the Declining Interest Rate Scenario:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2025\n2026\n2027\n(In millions, net of income tax)\nRevenues\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses)\n$\n263 \n$\n(27)\n$\n(23)\nExpenses\nMarket Risk Benefit Remeasurement (Gains) Losses\n$\n(435)\n$\n34 \n$\n3 \nAdjusted Earnings\nGroup Benefits\n$\n(6)\n$\n(19)\n$\n(32)\nRIS\n(8)\n(24)\n(28)\nAsia (Japan only)\n(11)\n(24)\n(35)\nMetLife Holdings\n(7)\n(23)\n(34)\nCorporate & Other \n(3)\n(14)\n(30)\nTotal Adjusted Earnings Impact\n$\n(35)\n$\n(104)\n$\n(159)\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on net derivative gains (losses), market risk benefit remeasurement (gains) losses and adjusted earnings for certain of our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, for the Rising Interest Rate Scenario:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2025\n2026\n2027\n(In millions, net of income tax)\nRevenues\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses)\n$\n(200)\n$\n2 \n$\n13 \nExpenses\nMarket Risk Benefit Remeasurement (Gains) Losses\n$\n332 \n$\n23 \n$\n(7)\nAdjusted Earnings\nGroup Benefits\n$\n6 \n$\n19 \n$\n33 \nRIS\n7 \n25 \n31 \nAsia (Japan only)\n11 \n25 \n36 \nMetLife Holdings\n14 \n28 \n39 \nCorporate & Other \n2 \n13 \n31 \nTotal Adjusted Earnings Impact\n$\n40 \n$\n110 \n$\n170 \nSegments and Corporate & Other\nThe primary drivers impacting certain of our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, in the hypothetical interest rate scenarios are summarized below. Our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments are excluded given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity. For additional information regarding account values subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees, the maturity profile of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale (“AFS”), and the yield on invested assets, see “— Investments,” and Notes 5 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGroup Benefits\nDeclining Interest Rate Scenario\n. Our group life insurance products are primarily renewable term policies. This provides repricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets. \n50\nTable of Contents\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Additionally, we experience gross margin compression from our disability policy claim reserves for which crediting rates cannot be reduced. We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression for both products. \nGross margin compression is limited for our group disability products, which are generally renewable term policies allowing for crediting rate adjustments at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and the prevailing interest rate assumptions. \nRising Interest Rate Scenario\n. We reinvest our cash flows from our group insurance products in higher yielding assets, mitigating the impact of (i) higher interest crediting rates on, primarily, our retained asset accounts, and (ii) lower income from our derivative positions used to mitigate low interest rate margin compression.\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nThis business contains both short- and long-duration products consisting of capital market products, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products. \nThe two hypothetical interest rate scenarios do not assume any additional ALM actions we may take to preserve margins.\nDeclining Interest Rate Scenario\n. A significant portion of short-duration products are managed on a floating rate basis, which mitigates gross margin compression. Our long-duration products have very predictable cash flows and we use both interest rate derivatives and asset/liability duration matching to mitigate gross margin compression. These mitigating strategies partially offset the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets. Based on our investment portfolios and expected cash flows, only a small portion of invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk through 2027.\nRising Interest Rate Scenario\n. Our long-duration products, which have very predictable cash flows, benefit from reinvesting in higher yielding assets, which is partially offset by the negative impact of lower income from derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment. A significant portion of our short-duration products are managed on a floating rate basis. The negative impact of higher crediting rates on these short-duration products is partially offset by higher income from derivative positions designed to protect against a rising interest rate environment. \nAsia (Japan Only)\nDeclining Interest Rate Scenario. \nOur Japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident & health products, many of which are U.S. dollar denominated. We experience gross margin compression to the extent our investment portfolios are U.S. interest rate sensitive and we are unable to offset the impact by lowering interest crediting rates. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies.\nOur Japan business also offers U.S. dollar denominated annuities which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set upon issuance. This allows for tightly managing product ALM, cash flows and net spreads, which mitigates interest rate risk.\nRising Interest Rate Scenario. \nFor U.S. dollar denominated products, higher reinvestment rates on cash flows from these products more than offset the negative impacts of (i) higher interest crediting rates on such products, and (ii) lower income from derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment. \nMetLife Holdings\nDeclining Interest Rate Scenario. \nOur interest rate sensitive life products include traditional and universal life products. Since most of our traditional life insurance is participating, we can mitigate gross margin compression by adjusting the applicable dividend scale. For our universal life products, our interest rate risk exposure has been substantially reduced as a result of an external reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023 and we have minimal exposure from this block.\nOur annuity products can experience gross margin compression primarily from deferred annuities with minimum crediting rate guarantees. While most of these contracts are either at or slightly above their minimum crediting rate, we use interest rate derivatives to manage the gross margin compression risk.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOur long-term care business experiences gross margin compression as we cannot reduce interest crediting rates for established claim reserves. Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. We review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term care claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, set the discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate environment. \nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression.\nBased on our investment portfolios and cash flow estimates, approximately 6% of our invested assets each year are subject to reinvestment risk through 2027. \nRising Interest Rate Scenario. \nHigher reinvestment rates on cash flows, over time, more than offset the negative impacts of (i) higher interest crediting rates, and (ii) lower income from derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment. \nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other contains the surplus investment portfolios used to fund capital and liquidity needs, certain reinsurance agreements, collateral financing arrangements, and our outstanding debt and preferred securities. For purposes of the two hypothetical interest rate scenarios, the impact on pension and postretirement plan expenses is included within Corporate & Other and not allocated across segments. \nDeclining Interest Rate Scenario. \nThe negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets, over time, more than offsets the positive impact of lower interest expense on debt, preferred stock dividends and lower pension expense. Although low interest rates result in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increasing, the impact is more than offset by the corresponding returns on fixed income investments and results in lower expenses. \nRising Interest Rate Scenario\n. The positive impact of reinvesting in higher yielding assets, over time, more than offsets the negative impact of higher interest expense on debt, preferred stock dividends and higher pension expense. Although higher interest rates result in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities decreasing, the impact is more than offset by the corresponding returns on fixed income investments and results in higher expenses. \nCompetitive Pressures\nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See “Business — Competition.” Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Certain of the industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the ability to leverage the capabilities of new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third-party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. Rising demands from stakeholders to address ESG issues have resulted in insurers expanding their sustainability efforts. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry.\n \nSee “Business — Regulation.” In addition to financial strength, technological efficiency and organizational agility, we believe that the ability to adapt to changes in the competitive environment as a result of global market volatility, changing interest rates and uncertain economic conditions is a significant differentiator to success in the life insurance industry and the broader financial services industry, and we are well positioned to compete in this environment.\n52\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Developments\nIn the U.S., our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Laws and regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry. Regulators have also undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group products. See “Business — Regulation,” “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings Costs May Increase, and We May Find Limited Market Capacity for New Financings” and “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\n(i)\nfuture policy benefit liabilities (“FPBs”), MRBs, and the accounting for reinsurance;\n(ii)\nestimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n(iii)\ninvestment allowance for credit loss (“ACL”) and impairments;\n(iv)\nestimated fair values of freestanding derivatives; \n(v)\nmeasurement of goodwill and related impairment;\n(vi)\nmeasurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n(vii)\nmeasurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n(viii)\nliabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed — the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nFuture Policy Benefit Liabilities\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted an accounting pronouncement related to targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts (“LDTI”) with a January 1, 2021 transition date (the “LDTI Transition Date”). Generally, FPBs are payable over an extended period of time and calculated as the present value of future expected benefits and claim settlement expenses to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of FPBs for traditional long-duration non-participating products are expectations related to mortality, morbidity, termination, claim settlement expense, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, inflation, and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated as needed to reflect our expected experience for future periods. If net premiums exceed gross premiums (i.e., expected benefits exceed expected gross premiums), the FPBs are increased, and a corresponding adjustment is recognized in net income.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs.\n53\nTable of Contents\nTraditional non-participating long-duration and limited-payment contracts comprise\n \nthe majority of MetLife’s FPBs, inclusive of deferred profit liabilities, as described in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For such contracts, cash flow assumptions are used to project the amount and timing of expected future benefits and claim settlement expenses to be paid and the expected future premiums to be collected for a cohort. Generally, the liabilities for these products are updated retrospectively on a quarterly basis for actual experience and at least once a year for any changes in cash flow assumptions. The change in FPBs reflected in the statement of operations is calculated using a locked-in discount rate. For contracts issued prior to the LDTI Transition Date, the Company developed a cohort level locked-in discount rate that reflects the interest accretion rates that were locked in at inception of the underlying contracts (unless there was a historical premium deficiency event that resulted in updating the interest accretion rate prior to the LDTI Transition Date), or the acquisition date for contracts acquired through an assumed in-force reinsurance transaction or a business combination. As described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for contracts issued subsequent to the LDTI Transition Date, the upper-medium grade discount rate is locked-in for the cohort and used to discount the estimated cash flows. The Company generally interprets this as a rate comparable to that of a corporate single A discount rate and reflects the duration characteristics of the liability. The FPB for all cohorts is remeasured to a current upper-medium grade discount rate at each reporting period through other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”). \nLiabilities for universal and variable universal life secondary and paid-up guarantees (“additional insurance liabilities”) are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are investment income, mortality, lapse, and premium payment pattern and persistency. In addition, the projected account balance and assessments used in this calculation are impacted by the earned rate on investments and the interest crediting rates, which are typically subject to guaranteed minimums. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products’ separate account funds are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity indices, such as the S&P 500 Index. These assumptions are monitored and updated retrospectively based on market conditions and historical experience on a periodic basis.\nAccounting for reinsurance generally presents the income statement effect of direct policies on a net-of-reinsurance basis by using assumptions and methodologies consistent with those used to project the future performance of the underlying direct business. Further, the potential impact of counterparty credit risks is considered when measuring the reinsurance recoverables. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See “— Investment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments.” Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nWe measure market risk related to our market sensitive traditional long-duration non-participating and limited-payment contracts, additional insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables based on changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The results of this sensitivity analysis are included in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Risk Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis.” We have also assessed the sensitivities of hypothetical changes in significant assumptions to reported amounts related to our traditional long-duration non-participating and limited-payment contracts, additional insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables for products including, but not limited to, those within the disaggregated rollforwards included in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as reflected in the following table:\n54\nTable of Contents\nTraditional long-duration non-participating and limited-payment contracts, additional insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables\nDecember 31, 2024\nFPBs (1)\nReinsurance Recoverables\nNet Effect \nto Pre-tax\nNet Income\nNet Effect to OCI\nIncrease / (Decrease) (In millions)\nAssumptions (2):\nMortality\nEffect of an increase by 1%\n$\n(72)\n$\n2 \n$\n115 \n$\n(41)\nEffect of a decrease by 1%\n$\n74 \n$\n(2)\n$\n(117)\n$\n41 \nMorbidity (3)\n \nEffect of an increase by 5%\n$\n600 \n$\n4 \n$\n(850)\n$\n254 \nEffect of a decrease by 5%\n$\n(459)\n$\n(4)\n$\n705 \n$\n(250)\nLapse (4)\n \nEffect of an increase by 10%\n$\n(154)\n$\n(15)\n$\n481 \n$\n(342)\nEffect of a decrease by 10%\n$\n242 \n$\n15 \n$\n(604)\n$\n377 \n__________________\n(1)\nFPBs are inclusive of deferred profit liabilities where applicable.\n(2)\nAll sensitivities exclude potential changes in our future premium rate assumptions.\n(3)\nFor products which are subject to morbidity risk, MetLife applied sensitivities to the incidence rate assumptions only.\n(4)\nFor MetLife Holdings long-term care products, the lapse impacts include mortality as both mortality and lapse result in termination of these contracts without any additional benefit payment.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including the significant inputs, judgments, valuation methods and assumptions used in the establishment of FPBs, as well as the effect of changes in such factors on the measurement of our FPBs during the year. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nTraditional participating contracts comprise a significant portion of MetLife’s FPBs, as described in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For such contracts, original assumptions developed at the time of issue are locked-in and used in all future liability calculations. An additional liability would be required if the resulting liabilities are not adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is a premium deficiency). For these contracts, MetLife’s risk of adverse experience may be mitigated through adjustments to the dividend scales.\nFor all insurance assets and liabilities, MetLife holds capital and surplus to mitigate potential adverse experience development. The Company’s approaches for managing liquidity and capital are described in “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nMarket Risk Benefits\nMRBs are contracts or contract features that guarantee benefits, such as guaranteed minimum benefits (referred to as “GMXBs”), in addition to an account balance which expose insurance companies to other than nominal capital market risk (e.g., equity price, interest rate, and/or foreign currency exchange risk) and protect the contractholder from the same risk. Certain contracts may have multiple contract features or guarantees that meet the definition of an MRB. Those benefits are aggregated and measured as a single compound MRB.\n55\nTable of Contents\nAll identified MRBs are required to be measured at estimated fair value, which is determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees attributable to those benefit features. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these MRBs also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.’s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nChanges in the estimated fair value of MRBs are recognized in net income, except for fair value changes attributable to a change in nonperformance risk of the Company which is recorded within OCI. \nThe estimated fair value of the net MRB liability may rise in volatile or declining equity markets or in a low interest rate environment. Market conditions including changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income, and changes in our nonperformance risk could materially affect OCI.\nWe measure market risk related to our MRBs based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The results of this sensitivity analysis are included in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Risk Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis.” We have also assessed the sensitivities of hypothetical changes in significant assumptions to reported amounts related to our MRBs for products included within the disaggregated rollforwards in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as reflected in the following table: \nDecember 31, 2024\nMRBs\n(Liabilities net of Assets)\nNet Effect\nto Pre-tax\nNet Income\nNet Effect to OCI\nIncrease / (Decrease) (In millions)\nAssumptions:\nMortality\nEffect of an increase by 1%\n$\n2 \n$\n— \n$\n(2)\nEffect of a decrease by 1%\n$\n(2)\n$\n— \n$\n2 \nLapse\nEffect of an increase by 10%\n$\n(21)\n$\n23 \n$\n(2)\nEffect of a decrease by 10%\n$\n20 \n$\n(22)\n$\n2 \nNonperformance risk \nEffect of an increase by 50 bps\n$\n(173)\nN/A\n$\n173 \nEffect of a decrease by 50 bps\n$\n190 \nN/A\n$\n(190)\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including the significant inputs, judgments, valuation methods and assumptions used in the establishment of the MRBs, as well as the effect of changes in such factors on the measurement of our MRBs during the year. Also, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value measurement of MRBs.\n56\nTable of Contents\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nThe estimated fair values of our investments are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring significant management judgment, including assumptions or estimates, are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments. Unobservable inputs are based on management’s assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing such investments. The methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nFor the vast majority of our investments, sensitivity analysis regarding unobservable inputs is not necessary or appropriate, as they are valued using quoted prices, as described above. Quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement and the sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in those inputs for the more significant asset and liability classes measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis is presented in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments\nThe significant estimates and inherent uncertainties related to our evaluation of credit loss and impairments on our investment portfolio are summarized below. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for information regarding the sensitivity of our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loan portfolios to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. \nFixed Maturity Securities\nThe assessment of whether a credit loss has occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of whether the net amount expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis. We consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. We evaluate credit loss by considering information that changes from time to time about past events, current and forecasted economic conditions, and we measure credit loss by estimating recovery value using a discounted cash flow analysis. We estimate recovery value based on our best estimate of future cash flows, which is inherently subjective, and methodologies can vary depending on the facts and circumstances specific to each security. We record an ACL for the amount of the credit loss instead of recording a reduction of the amortized cost. The evaluation processes, measurement methodologies, significant inputs and significant judgments and assumptions used to determine the amount of credit loss are described in Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The determination of the amount of ACL is subjective as it includes our estimates and assumptions and assessment of known and inherent risks. We revise these estimates and assumptions as conditions change and new information becomes available. The valuation of our fixed maturity securities portfolio is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the estimated fair value of the portion of our fixed maturities securities portfolio that is foreign denominated is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n57\nTable of Contents\nMortgage Loans\nThe ACL is established both for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for loans with dissimilar risk characteristics, collateral dependent loans and certain modified loans, individually on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loans that we do not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loans being presented at the net amount expected to be collected. To determine the mortgage loan ACL, we apply significant judgment to estimate expected lifetime credit loss over the contractual term of our mortgage loans adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions; and we consider past events and current and forecasted economic conditions which are subject to inherent uncertainty and which may change from time to time. The ACL methodologies, significant inputs and significant judgments and assumptions used to determine the amount of credit loss are described in Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The determination of the amount of ACL is subjective as it includes our estimates and assumptions and assessment of known and inherent risks. We revise these estimates as conditions change and new information becomes available.\n \nThe estimated fair value of our mortgage loan portfolio is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the estimated fair value of the portion of our mortgage loan portfolio that is foreign denominated is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. \nLeases, Real Estate and Other Asset Classes\nThe determination of the amount of ACL\n \non leases and impairments on real estate and the remaining asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. The evaluation processes, measurement methodologies, significant inputs and significant judgments and assumptions used to determine the amount of ACL and impairments are described in Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs. See also “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for information regarding the sensitivity of our derivatives to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity market prices.\nGoodwill \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, the Company will consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying value of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected adjusted earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, interest rate levels, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit. \n58\nTable of Contents\nWe apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based may differ from actual future results. The estimated fair value of the reporting units tested can be impacted by unexpected changes in the legislative, regulatory and macroeconomic environment. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests on all reporting units using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The quantitative assessment utilized the market multiple or embedded value approaches, and, when appropriate, was supplemented with a discounted cash flow valuation based on best available data as of June 30, 2024. The Company concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\nSee Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our goodwill.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nCertain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on amendments to our U.S. benefit plans. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. Given the amount of plan assets as of December 31, 2023, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs in 2024 would have been as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Net Periodic Pension Cost\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Net Other Postretirement\nBenefit Cost\n(In millions)\nIncrease in expected rate of return by 100 bps\n$\n(79)\n$\n(13)\nDecrease in expected rate of return by 100 bps\n$\n79 \n$\n13 \n This table considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.\nWe determine the discount rates used to value the Company’s pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. Given our pension and postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2023, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been as follows: \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Net Periodic Pension Cost\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Net Other Postretirement\nBenefit Cost\n(In millions)\nIncrease in discount rate by 100 bps\n$\n(62)\n$\n(4)\nDecrease in discount rate by 100 bps\n$\n49 \n$\n— \n59\nTable of Contents\nGiven our pension and postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2024, the end of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our benefit obligations would have been as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Pension Benefit Obligation\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Other Postretirement\nBenefit Obligation\n(In millions)\nIncrease in discount rate by 100 bps\n$\n(778)\n$\n(65)\nDecrease in discount rate by 100 bps\n$\n914 \n$\n77 \nThese tables consider only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nOur accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nThe Company considers all available factors, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of these factors, a partial or full valuation allowance for categories of deferred tax assets is required. The weight given to these factors is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Examples of factors considered in determining deferred tax asset realizability include past earnings history, projections of taxable income and tax planning strategies, including the intent and ability to hold certain securities until they recover in value. Changes in tax laws and/or statutory tax rates in countries in which we operate could have an impact on our valuation of net deferred tax assets. If there had been a 1% increase in the global effective income tax rate, the change would have resulted in an approximate $\n132 \nmillion increase in the net deferred income tax asset balance at December 31, 2024. \nSee Notes 1 and 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of reliable data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 24\n \nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\n60\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisitions\nPending Acquisition of PineBridge Investments\nFor information regarding the Company’s pending acquisition of PineBridge Investments, a global asset manager, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOwnership Increase of PNB MetLife\nIn 2024 and 2022, the Company acquired approximately 2.0% and 15.0% ownership in PNB MetLife India Insurance Company Limited (“PNB MetLife”), respectively.

We position our portfolio based on relative value and our view of the economy and financial markets. We maintain our focus on appropriate level of diversification and asset quality.\nWe manage our investment portfolio using disciplined ALM principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with the vast majority of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities.\nInvested Assets and Cash and Cash Equivalents Subject to Ceded Reinsurance with Third Parties\nThe Company maintains invested assets and cash and cash equivalents that are subject to ceded reinsurance with third parties. These assets are reflected in our consolidated financial statements, but the investment returns are ceded to third-party reinsurers (“Reinsurance adjustments”). Reinsurance adjustments, unless otherwise stated, have been excluded from the amounts within the Investments sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Global inflation, supply chain disruptions, acts of war and banking sector volatility continue to impact the global economy and financial markets and have caused volatility in the global equity, credit and real estate markets. See “— Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment” for further information regarding conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally which may affect us. These factors may persist for some time and may continue to impact pricing levels of risk-bearing investments, as well as our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives.

The countries included in the following table have been the most affected by these risks.

Asset carrying values utilized in the calculation of yields exclude unrecognized unrealized gains (losses), mortgage loans originated for third parties, invested assets and cash and cash equivalents subject to ceded reinsurance with third parties, collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, annuities funding structured settlement claims, freestanding derivative assets, collateral received from derivative counterparties and contractholder-directed equity securities.

However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of provision for credit loss and impairments on our investment portfolio, as well as realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nSee “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results” for an analysis of the year-over-year changes in realized gains (losses) on investments sold, provision (release) for credit loss and impairments and non-investment portfolio gains (losses).\n Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\nThe following table presents public and private fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities held at:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nSecurities by Type\nEstimated Fair\nValue\n% of\nTotal\nEstimated Fair\nValue\n% of\nTotal\n(Dollars in millions)\nFixed maturity securities AFS\nPublicly traded\n$\n201,259 \n72.2 \n%\n$\n209,616 \n74.5 \n%\nPrivately placed\n77,393 \n27.8 \n71,796 \n25.5 \nTotal fixed maturity securities AFS excluding invested assets subject to ceded reinsurance\n$\n278,652 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n281,412 \n100.0 \n%\nReinsurance adjustments\n2,391 \n— \nTotal fixed maturity securities AFS\n$\n281,043 \n$\n281,412 \nPercentage of cash and invested assets excluding invested assets subject to ceded reinsurance\n60.7 \n%\n60.3 \n%\nEquity securities\nPublicly traded\n$\n474 \n66.6 \n%\n$\n506 \n66.8 \n%\nPrivately held\n238 \n33.4 \n251 \n33.2 \nTotal equity securities\n$\n712 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n757 \n100.0 \n%\nPercentage of cash and invested assets\n0.2 \n%\n0.2 \n%\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about fixed maturity securities AFS by sector, contractual maturities, continuous gross unrealized losses and equity securities by security type and the related cost, net unrealized gains (losses) and estimated fair value of these securities; as well as realized gains (losses) on sales and disposals and unrealized net gains (losses) recognized in earnings.\nIncluded within fixed maturity securities AFS are structured securities, including RMBS, ABS & CLO and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) (collectively, “Structured Products”). See “— Structured Products” for further information.\n81\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Securities\n. We are responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of our investments. We determine the estimated fair value of publicly traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations. We determine the estimated fair value of privately placed securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: market standard internal matrix pricing, market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques, or independent pricing services (after we determine the independent pricing services’ use of available observable market data). For publicly traded securities, the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies. When a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service, management values the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, and non-binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities. Independent non-binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data. As shown in the following section, less than 1% of our fixed maturity securities AFS were valued using non-binding quotations from independent brokers at December 31, 2024.\nSenior management, independent of the trading and investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies for securities, mortgage loans, real estate and derivatives. On a quarterly basis, new transaction types and markets are reviewed and approved to ensure that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. Senior management oversees the selection of independent third-party pricing providers and the controls and procedures to evaluate third-party pricing. \nWe review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revise those methodologies when necessary based on changing market conditions. Assurance is gained on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with fair value accounting guidance through controls designed to ensure valuations represent an exit price. Several controls are utilized, including certain monthly controls, which include, but are not limited to, analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management’s knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads to assess activity, comparing prices from multiple independent pricing services and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market-based parameters. The process includes a determination of the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data. We ensure that prices received from independent brokers, also referred to herein as “consensus pricing,” are representative of estimated fair value by considering such pricing relative to our knowledge of the current market dynamics and current pricing for similar investments.\nOn a quarterly basis, we also apply a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. If prices received from independent pricing services are not considered reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value, independent non-binding broker quotations are obtained, or an internally developed valuation is prepared. Internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value, compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not produce material differences in the estimated fair values for the majority of the portfolio; accordingly, overrides were not material. This is, in part, because internal estimates are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants. In the absence of such market-based evidence, management’s best estimate is used.\nWe have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of our securities. Based on the results of this review and investment class analysis, each instrument is categorized as Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for valuation approaches and key inputs by major category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n82\nTable of Contents\nFair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\nFixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources were as follows:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nLevel\nFixed Maturity\nSecurities AFS\nEquity\nSecurities\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nLevel 1\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n$\n16,597 \n6.0 \n%\n$\n415 \n58.4 \n%\nLevel 2\nIndependent pricing sources\n227,495 \n81.6 \n58 \n8.1 \nInternal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n— \n— \n3 \n0.4 \nSignificant other observable inputs\n$\n227,495 \n81.6 \n%\n$\n61 \n8.5 \n%\nLevel 3\nIndependent pricing sources\n26,773 \n9.6 \n30 \n4.2 \nInternal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n7,179 \n2.6 \n200 \n28.1 \nIndependent broker quotations\n608 \n0.2 \n6 \n0.8 \nSignificant unobservable inputs\n$\n34,560 \n12.4 \n%\n$\n236 \n33.1 \n%\nTotal at estimated fair value excluding invested assets subject to ceded reinsurance\n$\n278,652 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n712 \n100.0 \n%\nReinsurance adjustments\n2,391 \n— \nTotal at estimated fair value\n$\n281,043 \n$\n712 \nSee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities fair value hierarchy; a rollforward of the fair value measurements for securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs; transfers into and/or out of Level 3; and further information about the valuation approaches and inputs by level by major classes of invested assets that affect the amounts reported above.\nThe majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities were concentrated in three sectors at December 31, 2024: foreign corporate securities, U.S. corporate securities and ABS & CLO. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AF\nS incr\neased by $1.6 billion, \nor 4.9%. The increase was\n driven by purchases in excess of sales, partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 in excess of transfers into Level 3 and a decrease in estimated fair value recognized in OCI.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality — Ratings \nThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity securities of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. The NAIC assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories defined as “NAIC designations.” In general, securities with NAIC designations of 1 and 2 are considered investment grade and securities with NAIC designations of 3 through 6 are considered below investment grade. If no NAIC designation is available, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used.\nNAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS are based on a modeling methodology that estimates security level expected losses under a variety of economic scenarios. The modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost; while for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued after January 1, 2013, the modeling methodology does not incorporate the amortized cost of the security. The NAIC’s objective with the modeling methodology is to increase accuracy in estimating expected losses and recovery value, and to use this credit quality assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for our non-agency RMBS and CMBS in our disclosures below. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When we acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.\n83\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the six NAIC designations, the NAIC maintains 20 “NAIC designation categories” which is an additional, more granular credit quality categorization. These NAIC designation categories correspond more closely to the NRSRO’s alpha-numeric credit quality ratings. The NAIC maintains unique RBC factors for each of the 20 NAIC designation categories. The NAIC’s goal is to better align RBC charges on securities with the instruments’ actual credit risk.\nRating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), S&P, Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”), Morningstar DBRS, A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), Kroll Bond Rating Agency, LLC and Egan-Jones Ratings Company. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nNAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSROs, except for (i) non-agency RMBS and CMBS as described above, and (ii) securities rated Ca or C by NRSROs, included within Caa and lower in our disclosures below, that are designated NAIC 6; accordingly, NAIC designations may not correspond to NRSRO ratings. \nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are presented using NAIC designations for modeled securities. In addition, in the following table, the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations is provided.\n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n \n2024\n2023\nNRSRO\nRating\nNAIC  Designation\nAmortized\nCost net of ACL\nUnrealized\nGains (Losses)\nEstimated\nFair\nValue\n% of \nTotal\nAmortized\nCost net of ACL\nUnrealized\nGains (Losses)\nEstimated\nFair\nValue\n% of\nTotal\n \n \n (Dollars in millions)\nAaa/Aa/A\n1\n$\n212,723 \n$\n(20,624)\n$\n192,099 \n68.9 \n%\n$\n209,232 \n$\n(14,510)\n$\n194,722 \n69.2 \n%\nBaa\n2\n79,308 \n(4,963)\n74,345 \n26.7 \n77,534 \n(3,854)\n73,680 \n26.2 \nSubtotal investment grade\n292,031 \n(25,587)\n266,444 \n95.6 \n286,766 \n(18,364)\n268,402 \n95.4 \nBa\n3\n8,834 \n(154)\n8,680 \n3.1 \n10,694 \n(395)\n10,299 \n3.7 \nB\n4\n3,279 \n(244)\n3,035 \n1.1 \n2,491 \n(120)\n2,371 \n0.8 \nCaa and lower\n5\n478 \n(53)\n425 \n0.2 \n280 \n(22)\n258 \n0.1 \nIn or near default\n6\n106 \n(38)\n68 \n— \n140 \n(58)\n82 \n— \nSubtotal below investment grade\n12,697 \n(489)\n12,208 \n4.4 \n13,605 \n(595)\n13,010 \n4.6 \nTotal fixed maturity securities AFS excluding invested assets subject to ceded reinsurance\n$\n304,728 \n$\n(26,076)\n$\n278,652 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n300,371 \n$\n(18,959)\n$\n281,412 \n100.0 \n%\nReinsurance adjustments\n2,533 \n(142)\n2,391 \n— \n— \n— \nTotal fixed maturity securities AFS\n$\n307,261 \n$\n(26,218)\n$\n281,043 \n$\n300,371 \n$\n(18,959)\n$\n281,412 \n84\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present total fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value, by sector and by NRSRO rating, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are presented using NAIC designations for modeled securities.

We held $63.7 billion and $56.3 billion of Structured Products at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS & CLO and CMBS sections below.\nRMBS \nOur RMBS portfolio is broadly diversified by security type and risk profile.\nOn a security type basis, RMBS includes collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\nOn a risk profile basis, RMBS includes Agency and Non-Agency securities. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Government National Mortgage Association. Non-Agency securities include prime, prime investor, non-qualified residential mortgage (“NQM”), and alternative residential mortgage loans (“Alt-A”), and reperforming and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. Prime (owner-occupied) and prime investor (non-owner-occupied) loans were originated to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. NQM and Alt-A are classifications of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles, while reperforming loans were previously delinquent that returned to performing status.\n86\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our RMBS portfolio by security type, risk profile and ratings profile at:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \nEstimated\nFair\nValue\n% of\nTotal\nNet \nUnrealized \nGains (Losses) \nEstimated\nFair\nValue\n% of\nTotal\nNet \nUnrealized \nGains (Losses)\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nSecurity type\nCollateralized mortgage obligations\n$\n21,568 \n63.2 \n%\n$\n(1,370)\n$\n16,704 \n57.4 \n%\n$\n(1,268)\nPass-through mortgage-backed securities\n12,567 \n36.8 \n(1,294)\n12,392 \n42.6 \n(1,114)\nTotal RMBS excluding invested assets subject to ceded reinsurance\n$\n34,135 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n(2,664)\n$\n29,096 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n(2,382)\nReinsurance adjustments\n286 \n1 \n— \n— \nTotal RMBS\n$\n34,421 \n$\n(2,663)\n$\n29,096 \n$\n(2,382)\nRisk profile\nAgency\n$\n20,660 \n60.5 \n%\n$\n(2,058)\n$\n18,472 \n63.5 \n%\n$\n(1,650)\nNon-Agency\nPrime and prime investor\n6,390 \n18.7 \n(374)\n4,827 \n16.6 \n(435)\nNQM and Alt-A\n1,699 \n5.0 \n(37)\n1,760 \n6.0 \n(75)\nReperforming and sub-prime\n3,579 \n10.5 \n(173)\n2,622 \n9.0 \n(167)\nOther (1)\n1,807 \n5.3 \n(22)\n1,415 \n4.9 \n(55)\nSubtotal Non-Agency\n13,475 \n39.5 \n%\n(606)\n10,624 \n36.5 \n%\n(732)\nTotal RMBS excluding invested assets subject to ceded reinsurance\n$\n34,135 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n(2,664)\n$\n29,096 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n(2,382)\nReinsurance adjustments\n286 \n1 \n— \n— \nTotal RMBS\n$\n34,421 \n$\n(2,663)\n$\n29,096 \n$\n(2,382)\nRatings profile\nRated Aaa and Aa\n$\n29,158 \n85.4 \n%\n$\n25,307 \n87.0 \n%\nDesignated NAIC 1\n$\n32,860 \n96.3 \n%\n$\n28,384 \n97.6 \n%\n__________________\n(1)\nOther Non-Agency RMBS are broadly diversified across several subsectors and issuers, including securities collateralized by the following mortgage loan types: single family rental, early buyout securitization and small business commercial.\nWe manage our exposure to reperforming and sub-prime RMBS holdings by focusing primarily on senior tranche securities, stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Our reperforming RMBS are generally newer vintage securities and higher quality at purchase and the vast majority are investment grade under NAIC designations (e.g., NAIC 1 and NAIC 2).

We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the securities are returned to us. Through these arrangements, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of \n$14.4 billion\n and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, including a portion that may require the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. See Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the secured borrowings accounting and the classification of revenues and expenses.\nThird-party custodian administered programs: The estimated fair value of securities we own which are loaned in connection with these programs was \n$433 million\n and $362 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated fair value of the related non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf, which is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements and \ncannot be sold or re-pledged, \nwas \n$443 million\n and $371 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n89\nTable of Contents\nNet Mortgage Loans\nOur mortgage loan investments are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. The Company originates and acquires mortgage loans and, in certain cases, transfers proportional rights to cash flows of certain mortgage loans to third parties under participation agreements, which are recorded as secured borrowings.

Of our net commercial and agricultural mortgage loans carried at amortized cost, 87% are collateralized by properties located in the U.S., with the remaining\n \n13% collateralized by properties located primarily in Mexico, the U.K. and Australia at December 31, 2024. The carrying values of our net commercial and agricultural mortgage loans collateralized by properties located in California, New York and Texas were 16%, 8% and 6%, respectively, of total net commercial and agricultural mortgage loans at December 31, 2024. Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loan investments by generally lending up to 75% of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.\nWe manage our residential mortgage loans carried at amortized cost in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration, with 91% collateralized by properties located in the U.S., and the remaining 9% collateralized by properties located in Chile, at December 31, 2024. The carrying values of our residential mortgage loans located in California, Florida and New York were 34%, 10% and 7%, respectively, of total residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2024.\n90\nTable of Contents\nNet Commercial Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and Property Type\n. Net commercial mortgage loans are the largest mortgage loan portfolio segment.

Our portfolio is comprised primarily of lower risk loans with higher debt-service coverage ratios (“DSCR”) and lower loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios, as shown below.\nCredit Quality — Monitoring Process\n. We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review by credit quality indicator and by the performance indicators of current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See below for further information on net mortgage loans by credit quality indicator. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information by performance indicator.\n91\nTable of Contents\nWe review our commercial mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios, DSCR and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher LTV ratios and lower DSCR. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loan investments is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher LTV ratios. Agricultural mortgage loan investments are reviewed on an ongoing basis which include, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios and borrower creditworthiness, including reviews on a geographic and property-type basis. We review our residential mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as nonperforming loans. See Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loan investments and related ACL methodology.\nLTV ratios and DSCR are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loan investments. LTV ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loan investments. LTV ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. An LTV ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. An LTV ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the LTV ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the DSCR, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our net commercial mortgage loans, our average LTV ratio was 69% and 64% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and our average DSCR was 2.1x and 2.3x at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The DSCR and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated routinely. In addition, the LTV ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan investments. For our net agricultural mortgage loans, our average LTV ratio was 46% and 47% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The values utilized in calculating our agricultural mortgage loan investments LTV ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of our portfolio and are routinely updated.\nThe distribution of our net commercial mortgage loan portfolios totaling $49.0 billion at amortized cost at December 31, 2024 by key credit quality indicators of LTV and DSCR was as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDSCR\nLTV\n> 1.2x\n1.0-1.2x\n< 1.0x\nTotal\n<65%\n45.9 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n1.6 \n%\n49.9 \n%\n65% - 75%\n18.1 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n0.8 \n%\n20.3 \n%\n76% - 80%\n5.4 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n0.7 \n%\n6.3 \n%\n>80%\n16.7 \n%\n3.8 \n%\n3.0 \n%\n23.5 \n%\nTotal\n86.1 \n%\n7.8 \n%\n6.1 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nThe distribution of our net agricultural mortgage loan portfolios totaling $19.0 billion at amortized cost at December 31, 2024 by the key credit quality indicator of LTV was as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nLTV\nTotal\n<65%\n92.7 \n%\n65% - 75%\n6.8 \n%\n76% - 80%\n0.2 \n%\n>80%\n0.3 \n%\nTotal\n100.0 \n%\n92\nTable of Contents\nMortgage Loan Allowance for Credit Loss. \nOur ACL is established for both pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for mortgage loan investments with dissimilar risk characteristics, such as collateral dependent loans, individually and on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in earnings within net investment gains (losses) in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loan investments that the Company does not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loan investments being presented at the net amount expected to be collected. \nIn determining our ACL, management (i) pools mortgage loans that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considers expected lifetime credit loss over contractual terms of mortgage loans, as adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considers past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Actual credit loss realized could be different from the amount of the ACL recorded. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the ACL to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the ACL. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the ACL. See Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how the ACL is established and monitored, and activity in and balances of the ACL.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\nOur real estate investments are comprised of wholly-owned properties, and interests in both real estate joint ventures and real estate funds which invest in a wide variety of properties and property types, consisting of single and multi-property projects, and are broadly diversified across multiple property types and geographies.\n The carrying value of our real estate investments was $13.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, or 2.9% of cash and invested assets, at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nOur real estate investments are typically stabilized properties that we intend to hold for the longer-term for portfolio diversification and long-term appreciation. Our real estate investment portfolio had appreciated to a $3.7 billion and $4.8 billion unrealized gain position at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n We continuously monitor and assess our real estate investments for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the real estate may be impaired. As a result of our impairment analyses, we recorded impairment (loss) of $36 million and $2 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe diversify our real estate investments by property type, form of equity interest (wholly-owned, joint venture and funds) and geographic region to reduce risk of concentration. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our real estate investments, by income type, as well as income earned\n.\nProperty type diversification: Our real estate investments are categorized by property type as follows at:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nProperty Type\nCarrying\nValue\n% of\nTotal\nCarrying\nValue\n% of\nTotal\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nOffice\n$\n4,285 \n32.1 \n%\n$\n4,110 \n30.8 \n%\nRetail\n1,257 \n9.4 \n1,261 \n9.5 \nApartment\n977 \n7.3 \n1,160 \n8.7 \nLand \n906 \n6.8 \n800 \n6.0 \nHotel \n700 \n5.3 \n779 \n5.8 \nIndustrial \n309 \n2.3 \n423 \n3.2 \nAgriculture\n18 \n0.1 \n7 \n0.1 \nOther \n35 \n0.3 \n13 \n0.1 \nWholly-owned and real estate joint ventures\n$\n8,487 \n63.6 \n%\n$\n8,553 \n64.2 \n%\nDiversified property types and multi-property\n1,206 \n9.0 \n1,120 \n8.4 \nReal estate funds\n3,649 \n27.4 \n3,659 \n27.4 \nTotal real estate and real estate joint ventures\n$\n13,342 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n13,332 \n100.0 \n%\n93\nTable of Contents\nGeographical diversification: Wholly-owned and real estate joint ventures totaled $8.5 billion at December 31, 2024, 68% of which were located in the U.S. and 32% of such properties were located outside the U.S., at December 31, 2024, at carrying value. The portion of these properties located in Japan, Washington, D.C. and Georgia were 28%, 9% and 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2024, at carrying value.\nOther Limited Partnership Interests\nOther limited partnership interests are comprised of investments in private funds, including private equity funds and hedge funds. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of other limited partnership interests wa\ns $14.4 billion\n and $14.8 billion, which included \n$18 million\n and $27 million of hedge funds, respectively. Other limited partnership interests we\nre 3.1% and 3.2% o\nf cash and invested assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash distributions on these investments are generated from investment gains, operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds.\nWe use the equity method of accounting for most of our private equity funds. We generally recognize our share of a private equity fund’s earnings in net investment income on a three-month lag, which is when the information is reported to us. Accordingly, changes in equity market levels, which can impact the underlying results of these private equity funds, are recognized in earnings within our net investment income on a three-month lag.\nOther Invested Assets\nThe following table presents the carrying value of our other invested assets by type at:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nAsset Type\nCarrying Value\n% of Total\nCarrying Value\n% of Total\n(Dollars in millions)\nFreestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values\n$\n8,212 \n44.4 \n%\n$\n8,737 \n48.0 \n%\nOperating joint ventures\n2,006 \n10.8 \n1,142 \n6.3 \nCompany-owned life insurance policies\n1,738 \n9.4 \n1,036 \n5.7 \nAnnuities funding structured settlement claims\n1,248 \n6.7 \n1,256 \n6.9 \nDirect financing leases\n1,228 \n6.6 \n1,304 \n7.2 \nTax credit and renewable energy partnerships\n714 \n3.9 \n1,034 \n5.7 \nFHLBNY common stock \n699 \n3.8 \n714 \n3.9 \nLeveraged leases\n623 \n3.4 \n689 \n3.8 \nFunds withheld\n433 \n2.3 \n436 \n2.4 \nOther\n1,603 \n8.7 \n1,854 \n10.1 \nTotal\n$\n18,504 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n18,202 \n100.0 \n%\nPercentage of cash and invested assets\n4.0 \n%\n3.9 \n%\n__________________\nSee Notes 1, 11 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, annuities funding structured settlement claims, direct financing and leveraged leases, operating joint ventures, FHLBNY common stock, and funds withheld.\nInvestment Commitments\nWe enter into the following commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See Note 24 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of our unfunded investment commitments at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

See also “— Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities,” “— Net Mortgage Loans,” “— Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures” and “— Other Limited Partnership Interests.” \n94\nTable of Contents\nDerivatives \nOverview\nWe are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives, such as market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for: \n•\nA comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.\n•\nInformation about the primary underlying risk exposure, gross notional amount, and estimated fair value of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n•\nThe statement of operations effects of derivatives in net investments in foreign operations, cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedging relationships for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nSee “— Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Derivatives” for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect derivatives. See also “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Management of Market Risk Exposures — Hedging Activities” for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses)\nA portion of our derivatives are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those derivatives not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions.\nCertain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits are accounted for as MRBs and measured at estimated fair value. We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. \nWe continuously review and refine our hedging strategy in light of changing economic and market conditions, evolving NAIC and the NYDFS statutory requirements, and accounting rule changes. As a part of our current hedging strategy, we maintain portfolio level derivatives in our macro hedge program. These macro hedge program derivatives mitigate the potential deterioration in our capital positions from significant adverse economic conditions.\nSee “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results” for an analysis of the year-over-year changes in net derivative gains (losses).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the following sections included elsewhere herein for additional information regarding the topics noted below:\n•\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n◦\nNote 3 (acquisitions and dispositions);\n◦\nNote 5 (funding agreements, reported in PABs and the related pledged collateral);\n◦\nNote 16 (long-term debt, short-term debt, credit and committed facilities, and debt and facility covenants);\n◦\nNote 17 (collateral financing arrangement and the related pledged collateral);\n◦\nNote 18 (junior subordinated debt securities and the related replacement capital covenant); and\n◦\nNote 19 (preferred stock and common stock, including the calculation and timing of dividend payments, restrictions on dividends, “dividend stopper” provisions, and MetLife, Inc.’s common stock repurchase authorizations).\n•\nNotes to the MetLife, Inc.

Such conditions may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see “— Industry Trends” and “— Investments — Current Environment.”\nLiquidity Management\nBased upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities.\nShort-term Liquidity and Liquid Assets \nAn integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our short-term liquidity position was $18.6 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, and liquid assets were $172.8 billion and $182.6 billion, respectively.\nShort-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nLiquid assets include short-term liquidity and publicly traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nCapital Management\nWe have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. These committees, including the Capital Management Committee and the ERC, regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Treasurer, and CRO. The ERC is also comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.’s CFO, CRO and Chief Investment Officer.\nOur Board of Directors and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors prior to obtaining full Board of Directors approval. The Board of Directors approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required.\n96\nTable of Contents\nThe Company\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs. We determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. We adjust the asset mix and asset maturities based on this rolling 12-month forecast. To support this forecast, we conduct cash flow and stress testing, which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities.\nUnder certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. A downgrade in our credit or financial strength ratings could also negatively affect our liquidity. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or if we are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, for securities in an unrealized loss position, realized losses would be incurred on securities sold and impairments would be incurred, if there is a need to sell securities prior to recovery, which may negatively impact our financial condition.\nAll general account assets within a particular legal entity, other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose, are generally available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity.\nCapital\nWe manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. See “— Rating Agencies” for information regarding such ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.\nStatutory Capital and Dividends\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements.\nRBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These rules apply to most of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels.\nAs a Delaware corporation, American Life is subject to Delaware law; however, because it does not conduct insurance business in Delaware or any other U.S. state, it is exempt from RBC requirements under Delaware law. American Life’s operations are also regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions in which it operates and is subject to capital and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions.\nThe amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to MetLife, Inc. or to other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, which provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in our businesses. We proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain of these activities may require regulatory approval. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife, Inc. and other parent entities by their respective insurance subsidiaries is governed by insurance laws and regulations. See “Business — Regulation — State Insurance Regulation” and “— MetLife, Inc. — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.”\n97\nTable of Contents\nAffiliated Reinsurance Transactions\nCertain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. cede certain products to various affiliated U.S. captive reinsurers and affiliated non-U.S. reinsurers for risk and capital management purposes, as well as to manage statutory reserve requirements. The reinsurance activities among these affiliated companies are eliminated within our consolidated results of operations.\nOur affiliated U.S. captive reinsurers are licensed under the Special Purpose Financial Captive law adopted by Vermont and South Carolina, their states of domicile. The statutory reserves of the affiliated ceding companies are supported by a combination of funds withheld assets, investment assets and letters of credit issued by unaffiliated financial institutions. MetLife, Inc. has entered into various support agreements in connection with the activities of these U.S. captive reinsurers.\nOur affiliated non-U.S. reinsurers are licensed as insurance companies under the laws of their jurisdictions of domicile, including Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. MetLife, Inc. has agreed to guarantee certain of the reinsurance obligations of one of our affiliated non-U.S. reinsurers.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our reinsurance activities.\nRating Agencies\nRating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to MetLife, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries. Financial strength ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in MetLife, Inc.’s securities. Insurer financial strength ratings are not statements of fact nor are they recommendations to purchase, hold or sell any security, contract or policy. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nRating agencies use an “outlook statement” of “positive,” “stable,” ‘‘negative’’ or “developing” to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A rating may have a “stable” outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a “stable” rating does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain rating agencies assign rating modifiers such as “CreditWatch” or “under review” to indicate their opinion regarding the potential direction of a rating. These ratings modifiers are generally assigned in connection with certain events such as potential mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or material changes in a company’s results, in order for the rating agency to perform its analysis to fully determine the rating implications of the event.\nOur insurer financial strength ratings at the date of this filing are indicated in the following table. Outlook is stable unless otherwise indicated. Additional information about financial strength ratings can be found on the websites of the respective rating agencies.\nA.M.

They are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. The level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our insurer financial strength ratings and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors. A downgrade in the credit ratings or insurer financial strength ratings of MetLife, Inc. or its subsidiaries could adversely impact us.\nSummary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\nOur primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital are summarized as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nSources:\nOperating activities, net\n$\n14,598 \n$\n13,721 \nNet change in PABs\n2,963 \n4,711 \nLong-term debt issued\n1,568 \n1,989 \nOther, net\n223 \n— \nTotal sources\n19,352 \n20,421 \nUses:\nInvesting activities, net\n11,493 \n10,246 \nNet change in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions\n244 \n3,283 \nLong-term debt repaid\n1,792 \n1,035 \nCollateral financing arrangement repaid\n161 \n79 \nDerivatives with certain financing elements and other derivative-related transaction, net\n157 \n74 \nNet change in mortgage loan secured financing\n597 \n163 \nTreasury stock acquired in connection with share repurchases\n3,207 \n3,103 \nDividends on preferred stock\n200 \n198 \nDividends on common stock\n1,527 \n1,566 \nOther, net\n— \n139 \nEffect of change in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n545 \n91 \nTotal uses\n19,923 \n19,977 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(571)\n$\n444 \nCash Flows from Operations\nThe principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows are the result of various life insurance, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense.\nCash Flows from Investments\nThe principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. In addition, cash inflows and outflows relate to sales and purchases of businesses. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process.\nCash Flows from Financing\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with PABs and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc.’s securities, withdrawals associated with PABs and the return of securities on loan.\n99\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nLiquidity and capital are provided by a variety of global funding sources, including: (i) preferred and common stock; (ii) short-term debt, which includes commercial paper; (iii) long-term debt; collateral financing arrangement; and junior subordinated debt securities; (iv) PABs, which includes funding agreements; (v) credit and committed facilities; (vi) shelf registration statement, which permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities and provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity; and (vii) dispositions. Additional details regarding certain of our primary sources of liquidity and capital are included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referenced in “— Overview” and are discussed below.\nThe diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under our credit and committed facilities. As commitments under these facilities may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding debt at:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nShort-term debt (1)\n$\n465 \n$\n119 \nLong-term debt (2)\n$\n15,086 \n$\n15,548 \nCollateral financing arrangement\n$\n476 \n$\n637 \nJunior subordinated debt securities\n$\n3,164 \n$\n3,161 \n__________________\n(1)\nThis is all short-term debt that is non-recourse to MetLife, Inc., subject to customary exceptions.

Certain investment subsidiaries have pledged assets to secure this debt.\nCertain of our debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as our Credit Facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We believe we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants at December 31, 2024.\n100\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Uses\nThe primary uses of liquidity and capital include: (i) common stock repurchases; (ii) dividends on common and preferred stock; (iii) preferred stock redemptions; (iv) debt repayments; (v) debt repurchases, redemptions and exchanges; (vi) contractual obligations, including PABs and insurance liabilities; (vii) pledged collateral; (viii) securities lending transactions, repurchase agreements and third-party custodian administered programs; (ix) mortgage loan secured financing; and (x) acquisitions. Additional details regarding certain of our primary uses of liquidity and capital are included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referenced in “— Overview” and are discussed below.\nCommon Stock Repurchases and Dividends\nAmong other factors that could restrict MetLife, Inc.’s ability to repurchase or pay dividends on its common stock are the “dividend stopper” provisions in MetLife, Inc.’s preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures.\n“Dividend Stopper” Provisions in MetLife’s Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures\nMetLife, Inc.’s preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures contain “dividend stopper” provisions under which MetLife, Inc. may not pay dividends on instruments junior to those instruments, including MetLife, Inc.’s common stock, nor repurchase its common stock, if payments have not been made on those instruments. The junior subordinated debentures further provide that MetLife, Inc. may, at its option and provided that certain conditions are met, elect to defer payment of interest.\nDebt Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, redemptions and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases, redemptions, or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase or redeem any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or redemptions will be determined at our discretion.\nPledged Collateral\nWe pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by counterparties in connection with our derivatives, the collateral financing arrangement related to the reinsurance of closed block liabilities, and with funding and advance agreements. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivatives.\nSecurities Lending Transactions, Repurchase Agreements and Third-Party Custodian Administered Programs\nSee “— Investments — Securities Lending Transactions, Repurchase Agreements and Third-Party Custodian Administered Programs.”\nMortgage Loan Secured Financing\nSee “— Investments — Net Mortgage Loans.”\nContractual Obligations\nPolicyholder Account Balances\nSee Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the components of PABs, including obligations under funding agreements. See “— Insurance Liabilities” regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to FPBs and PABs.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $335.8 billion ($40.7 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amount of $221.4 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\n101\nTable of Contents\nThe estimated cash flows represent cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges; annuitization; mortality; future interest credited; policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. Such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. For obligations denominated in foreign currencies, cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.\nInsurance Liabilities\nInsurance liabilities include FPBs, MRBs, at estimated fair value, other policy-related balances and policyholder dividends payable, which are all reported on the consolidated balance sheet and are more fully described in Notes 1, 4 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The sum of the estimated cash flows of $344.0 billion ($22.9 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amounts of $215.5 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, most significantly mortality, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nThe estimated cash flows reflect future estimated cash payments and (i) are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns; and (ii) consider future premium receipts on current policies in-force. Estimated cash payments are undiscounted as to interest, net of estimated future premiums on in-force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Payment of amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity.\nActual cash payments may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented on the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments.\nFor the majority of our insurance operations, estimated contractual obligations for FPBs and PABs are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes. These cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under GAAP.\nLiabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the MetLife Holdings segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. In the RIS segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the RIS business products that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, at December 31, 2024, there were funding agreements totaling $125 million that could be put back to the Company.\n102\nTable of Contents\nMetLife, Inc.\nLiquidity and Capital Management\nLiquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc.’s access to liquidity.\nMetLife, Inc.’s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. See “— The Company — Rating Agencies.”\nLiquid Assets\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, MetLife holding companies had $5.1 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. Of these amounts, $4.2 billion and $4.2 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $944 million and $1.0 billion were held by other MetLife holding companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and the collateral financing arrangement.\nLiquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in “— Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.”\nSee “— Consolidated Company Outlook” for the targeted level of liquid assets at the holding companies.\nMetLife, Inc. and Other MetLife Holding Companies Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets and Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets included in Free Cash Flow\nMetLife, Inc.’s sources and uses of liquid assets, as well as sources and uses of liquid assets included in free cash flow, are summarized as follows:\n103\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nSources and Uses of Liquid Assets\nSources and Uses of Liquid Assets Included in Free Cash Flow\nSources and Uses of Liquid Assets\nSources and Uses of Liquid Assets Included in Free Cash Flow\n(In millions)\nMetLife, Inc.

MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. \nThe primary uses of MetLife, Inc.’s liquid assets are principal and interest payments on long-term debt, dividends on and repurchases of common and preferred stock, capital contributions to subsidiaries, funding of business acquisitions, income taxes and operating expenses. MetLife, Inc. is party to various capital support commitments and guarantees with certain of its subsidiaries. \nIn addition, MetLife, Inc. issues loans to subsidiaries or subsidiaries issue loans to MetLife, Inc. Accordingly, changes in MetLife, Inc. liquid assets include issuances of loans to subsidiaries, proceeds of loans from subsidiaries and the related repayment of principal and payment of interest on such loans. \nSources and Uses of Liquid Assets of Other MetLife Holding Companies\nThe primary sources of liquid assets of other MetLife holding companies are dividends, returns of capital and remittances from their subsidiaries and branches, principally non-U.S. insurance companies; capital contributions received; receipts of principal and interest on loans to subsidiaries and affiliates and borrowings from subsidiaries and affiliates. MetLife, Inc.’s non-U.S. operations are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by local regulators.\nThe primary uses of liquid assets of other MetLife holding companies are capital contributions paid to their subsidiaries and branches, principally non-U.S. insurance companies; loans to subsidiaries and affiliates; principal and interest paid on loans from subsidiaries and affiliates; dividends and returns of capital to MetLife, Inc. and the following items, which are reported within other, net: business acquisitions; and operating expenses. \nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nMetLife, Inc.’s primary sources of liquidity and capital are provided by a variety of global funding sources, including: (i) dividends from subsidiaries; (ii) issuances of long-term debt; (iii) collateral financing arrangement and junior subordinated debentures; (iv) credit and committed facilities; and (v) dispositions. Additional details regarding certain of MetLife, Inc.’s primary sources of liquidity and capital are included in “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referenced in “— Overview” and are discussed below.\nDividends from Subsidiaries\nMetLife, Inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.\n105\nTable of Contents\nThe table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by MetLife, Inc.’s primary U.S. insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid:\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nCompany\nPermitted Without Approval (1)\nPaid (2)\nPermitted Without Approval (1)\nPaid (2)\nPermitted Without Approval (1)\n \n(In millions)\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company\n$\n2,732 \n$\n3,476 \n$\n3,476 \n$\n2,471 \n$\n2,471 \nAmerican Life Insurance Company\n$\n751 \n$\n1,485 \n$\n945 \n$\n1,887 \n$\n499 \nMetropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company\n$\n358 \n$\n373 \n$\n373 \n$\n189 \n$\n189 \n__________________\n(1)\nReflects dividend amounts that may be paid during the relevant year without prior regulatory approval. However, because dividend tests may be based on dividends previously paid over rolling 12-month periods, if paid before a specified date during such year, some or all of such dividends may require regulatory approval. \n(2)\nReflects all amounts paid, including those where regulatory approval was obtained as required.\nIn addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, MetLife, Inc. also received from certain other subsidiaries cash dividends of $133 million and $233 million, respectively, as well as cash returns of capital of $74 million and $6 million, respectively.\nThe dividend capacity of our non-U.S. operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit dividend payments to the parent company to a portion of the subsidiary’s prior year statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of our non-U.S. operations, including the FSA, may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to our first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into MetLife, Inc.\nWe proactively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market.\nLong-term Debt Outstanding\nThe following table summarizes the outstanding long-term debt of MetLife, Inc. at:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nLong-term debt — unaffiliated\n$\n14,431 \n$\n14,516 \nLong-term debt — affiliated\n$\n1,447 \n$\n1,585 \nJunior subordinated debt securities\n$\n2,470 \n$\n2,468 \nLiquidity and Capital Uses\nMetLife, Inc.’s primary uses of liquidity and capital include: (i) debt service; (ii) cash dividends on common and preferred stock; (iii) capital contributions to subsidiaries; (iv) common stock, preferred stock and debt repurchases and/or redemptions; (v) payment of general operating expenses; (vi) support agreements; and (vii) acquisitions. Additional details regarding certain of MetLife, Inc.’s primary uses of liquidity and capital are included in “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referenced in “— Overview” and are discussed below.\n106\nTable of Contents\nBased on our analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval, our investment portfolio and other cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable MetLife, Inc. to make payments on debt, pay cash dividends on its common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, repurchase its common stock and certain of its other securities, pay all general operating expenses and meet its cash needs under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios.\nAffiliated Capital and Debt Transactions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, excluding acquisitions, MetLife, Inc. invested a net amount of $254 million and $531 million, respectively, in various subsidiaries.\nMetLife, Inc. lends funds, as necessary, through credit agreements or otherwise to its subsidiaries and affiliates, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital requirements or to provide liquidity. MetLife, Inc. had loans to subsidiaries outstanding of $285 million and $305 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDebt Repayments\nMetLife, Inc. intends to repay, redeem or refinance, in whole or in part, all the debt that is due in 2025.\nThe following table summarizes MetLife, Inc.’s outstanding senior notes by year of maturity, excluding any premium or discount and unamortized issuance costs, at December 31, 2024:\nYear of Maturity\nPrincipal\nInterest Rate\n \n(In millions)\n \nUnaffiliated:\n2025\n$\n500 \n3.00%\n2025\n$\n500 \n3.60%\n2026\n$\n160 \n0.50%\n2029 - 2059\n$\n13,370 \nRanging from 0.77% - 6.50%\nAffiliated:\n2025\n$\n250 \n6.51%\n2026\n$\n102 \n1.64%\n2026\n$\n87 \n1.61%\n2026\n$\n78 \n1.59%\n2028\n$\n91 \n1.76%\n2028\n$\n122 \n1.72%\n2029 - 2031\n$\n717 \nRanging from 1.81% to 2.16%\nSupport Agreements\nMetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries (each, an “Obligor”) are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees with subsidiaries. Under these arrangements, each Obligor has agreed to cause the applicable entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual obligations. We anticipate that in the event these arrangements place demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet such demands.\nAdopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n107\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\nIn this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance on a consolidated and segment basis that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance our investors’ understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Segment-specific financial measures are calculated using only the portion of consolidated results attributable to that specific segment.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nNon-GAAP financial measures:\nComparable GAAP financial measures:\n(i)\nadjusted premiums, fees and other revenues \n(i)\npremiums, fees and other revenues \n(ii)\nadjusted earnings\n(ii)\nnet income (loss) \n(iii)\nadjusted earnings available to common\nshareholders\n(iii)\nnet income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders\n(iv)\nfree cash flow of all holding companies\n(iv)\nMetLife, Inc. (parent company only) net cash provided\nby (used in) operating activities\n(v) \nadjusted net investment income\n(v) \nnet investment income\nAny of these financial measures shown on a constant currency basis reflect the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and applied to the comparable prior period (“constant currency basis”). \nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in “— Results of Operations” and “— Investments.” Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable effort to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income. \nOur definitions of non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies.\nAdjusted earnings and related measures:\n•\nadjusted earnings; \n•\nadjusted earnings available to common shareholders; and\n•\nadjusted earnings available to common shareholders on a constant currency basis. \nAdjusted earnings is used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is our GAAP measure of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and related measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which senior management’s and many other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and related measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. \nAdjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends. For information relating to adjusted earnings, see “Financial Measure and Segment Accounting Policies” and “Corporate & Other” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, adjusted earnings available to common shareholders excludes the impact of preferred stock redemption premium, which is reported as a reduction to net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders.\n108\nTable of Contents\nReturn on equity, allocated equity and related measures:\n•\nTotal MetLife, Inc.’s adjusted common stockholders’ equity\n: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding unrealized investment gains (losses), net of related offsets, deferred gains (losses) on derivatives, future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), MRBs instrument-specific credit risk remeasurement gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI (AOCI other than FCTA) and the estimated fair value of certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, all net of income tax.\n•\nTotal MetLife, Inc.’s adjusted common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items\n: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding unrealized investment gains (losses), net of related offsets, deferred gains (losses) on derivatives, future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), MRBs instrument-specific credit risk remeasurement gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI (AOCI other than FCTA), the estimated fair value of certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives and total notable items, all net of income tax.\n•\nReturn on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity\n: net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average common stockholders’ equity.\n•\nAdjusted return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity\n: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average adjusted common stockholders’ equity.\n•\nAdjusted return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items\n: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average adjusted common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items.\n•\nAllocated equity\n: the portion of total MetLife, Inc.’s adjusted common stockholders’ equity that management allocates to each of its segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. See “— Risk Management— Economic Capital.”\nThe above measures represent a level of equity that excludes most components of AOCI, such as unrealized investment gains (losses), net of related offsets, and future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), as well as the impact of certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, as these amounts are primarily driven by market volatility.\nExpense ratio and direct expense ratio:\n•\nExpense ratio:\n other expenses, net of capitalization of DAC, divided by premiums, fees and other revenues.\n•\nDirect expense ratio:\n adjusted direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. Direct expenses are comprised of employee-related costs, third-party staffing costs, and general and administrative expenses.\n•\nDirect expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers:\n adjusted direct expenses, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfers.\nThe following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance results and outlook:\n•\nWe sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity. Further, sales statistics for our Latin America, Asia and EMEA segments are on a constant currency basis.\n•\nPension risk transfers include U.K. funded reinsurance.\n•\nNear-term represents one to three years.\n•\nWe refer to observable forward yield curves as of a particular date in connection with making our estimates for future results. The observable forward yield curves at a given time are based on implied future interest rates along a range of interest rate durations. This includes the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate which we use as a benchmark rate to describe longer-term interest rates used in our estimates for future results.\n•\nNotable items reflect the unexpected impact of events that affect the Company’s results, but that were unknown and that the Company could not anticipate when it devised its business plan. Notable items also include certain items regardless of the extent anticipated in the business plan, to help investors have a better understanding of MetLife’s results and to evaluate and forecast those results. Notable items represent a positive (negative) impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.\n109\nTable of Contents\n•\nThe Company uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. The Company defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife’s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities of MetLife, Inc. (parent company only) to free cash flow of all holding companies for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is provided below.\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of MetLife, Inc. to Free Cash Flow of All Holding Companies\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions, except ratios)\nMetLife, Inc.

Excluding these notable items from the denominator of the ratio, the adjusted free cash flow ratio for 2023 would be 65%.\nRisk Management\nWe have an integrated process for managing risk, that is supported by a Risk Appetite Statement approved by the Board of Directors. Risk management is overseen and conducted through multiple Board and senior management risk committees (financial and non-financial). The risk committees are established at the enterprise, regional and local levels, as needed, to oversee capital and risk positions, approve ALM strategies and limits, and establish certain corporate risk standards and policies. The risk committees are comprised of senior leaders from the lines of business and corporate functions which ensures comprehensive coverage and sharing of risk reporting. The ERC is responsible for reviewing all material risks impacting the enterprise and deciding on actions, if necessary, in the event risks exceed desired tolerances, taking into consideration industry best practices and the current environment to resolve or mitigate those risks.\nThree Lines of Defense\nMetLife operates under the “Three Lines of Defense” model. Under this model, the lines of business and corporate functions are the first and primary line of defense in identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing, and reporting risks. Global Risk Management forms the second line of defense providing strategic advisory services and effective challenge and oversight to the business and corporate functions in the first line of defense. Internal Audit serves as the third line of defense, providing independent assurance and testing over the risk and control environment and related processes and controls.\nGlobal Risk Management\nIndependent from the lines of business, the centralized Global Risk Management department, led by the CRO, coordinates across all risk committees to ensure that all material risks are properly identified, measured, monitored, managed and reported across the Company. The CRO reports to the CEO and is primarily responsible for maintaining and communicating the Company’s enterprise risk policies and for monitoring and analyzing all material risks.\nGlobal Risk Management considers and monitors a full range of risks relating to the Company’s solvency, liquidity, earnings, business operations and reputation. Global Risk Management’s primary responsibilities consist of:\n•\nimplementing an enterprise risk framework, which outlines our enterprise approach for managing financial and non-financial risk;\n•\ndeveloping policies and procedures for identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and reporting those risks identified in the enterprise risk framework;\n•\ncoordinating Own Risk Solvency Assessment for Board, senior management and regulator use;\n•\nestablishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels;\n•\nmeasuring capital on an economic basis;\n•\nmitigating compliance risk and establishing controls;\n•\nintegrating climate risk into MetLife’s risk management framework and developing climate risk capabilities; and \n•\nreporting to (i) the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors; (ii) the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors; and (iii) the financial and non-financial senior management committees on various aspects of risk.\n111\nTable of Contents\nKey Risk Types\nMetLife has defined each material risk to which it is exposed and has established individual frameworks to monitor, manage and report on the respective risk.\n•\nMarket Risk: is the risk of loss due to potential changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from fluctuations in financial market, real estate, and other economic factors. Market risk is comprised of interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, spread risk and inflation risk.\n•\nCredit Risk: is the risk of loss or credit rating downgrade arising from an obligor or counterparty with a direct or contingent financial obligation to MetLife that is either unable or unwilling to meet its obligation in full and on a timely basis. These risks arise from public and private fixed income assets, private loans including real estate, derivative transactions, bank deposits, reinsurance treaties and other similar contracts.\n•\nInsurance Risk: is the risk of loss or adverse change in insurance liabilities from changes in the level, trend, and volatility of insurance and policyholder behavior experience varying from best estimate assumptions. These variances can be driven by catastrophic events such as pandemics or can be the result of misestimating base assumptions. Insurance risks to MetLife generally arise from mortality, morbidity, longevity, and policyholder behavior.\n•\nNon-Financial Risk: is the risk of failed or inadequate internal processes, human errors, system errors or external events that may result in financial loss, non-financial damage, and/or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Non-Financial risk captures operational and compliance risks, including risks such as business interruption, customer protection, financial crime, privacy, and information security risk.\n•\nLiquidity Risk: refers to the risk that MetLife is unable to raise cash or collateral necessary to meet current obligations.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital can be deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our business. Our economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. MetLife’s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. For further information, see “Financial Measure and Segment Accounting Policies” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAsset/Liability Management\nWe actively manage our assets using an approach that is liability driven and balances quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity, concentration, and investment return. The goals of the investment process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are reasonably aligned on a cash flow and duration basis. The ALM process is the shared responsibility of the ALM, Global Risk Management, and Investments departments, with the engagement of senior members of the business segments and Finance, and is governed by the ALM Committees. The ALM Committees’ duties include reviewing and approving investment guidelines and limits, approving significant portfolio and ALM strategies and providing oversight of the ALM process. The directives of the ALM Committees are carried out and monitored through ALM Working Groups which are set up to manage risk by geography, product or portfolio type. The ALM Steering Committee oversees the activities of the underlying ALM Committees and Working Groups. The ALM Steering Committee reports to the ERC.\nWe establish portfolio guidelines that define ranges and limits related to asset allocation, interest rate risk, liquidity, concentration and other risks for each major business segment, legal entity or insurance product group. These guidelines support implementation of investment strategies used to adequately fund our liabilities within acceptable levels of risk. We also establish hedging programs and associated investment portfolios for different blocks of business. The ALM Working Groups monitor these strategies and programs through regular review of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve sensitivity, convexity, value at risk, market sensitivities (to interest rates, equity market levels, equity volatility, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation), stress scenario payoffs, liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality.\n112\nTable of Contents\nWe manage credit risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit, market valuation and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation limits. These risk limits, approved annually by the Investment Risk Committee, promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit and equity risk exposure, as measured by our economic capital framework. For real estate assets, we manage credit and market risk through asset allocation limits and by diversifying by geography, property and product type. \nInformation Security Risk Management\nFor details on information security risk management see “Cybersecurity.”\n113\nTable of Contents",
