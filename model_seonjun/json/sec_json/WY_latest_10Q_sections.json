This includes selling price plus freight, minus normal sales deductions. Real Estate transactions are presented at the contract sales price before commissions and closing costs, net of any credits. \n●\nNet contribution (charge) to earnings does not include interest expense or income taxes.\n \nECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS\nOur market conditions and the strength of the broader U.S. economy are, and will continue to be, influenced by the trajectory of activity in the U.S. housing and repair and remodel segments, inflation trends and interest rates. The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, particularly the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S. South has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. Our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the U.S. and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets.\n \nOngoing U.S. trade policy changes have resulted in continued macroeconomic uncertainty and increased cautiousness by consumers. These policies, along with potential countermeasures by other countries, and the effects of certain executive orders and trade investigations relating to our businesses, have the potential to affect supply and demand trends, import and export dynamics, and pricing for our products. Trade and tariff policies are generally separate from the annual establishment and collection of anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) placed on certain products and countries, such as for Canadian softwood lumber.\n \nThe discussion below includes a number of publicly available data points, many of which are obtained from U.S. federal government institutions. Due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, availability of these data points is limited to August 2025. All other data points are updated through third quarter 2025.\nHome sales and building activity continues to moderate in response to elevated mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and lower consumer confidence. While overall housing inventory remains historically low across many markets, there has been some increase in unsold new and existing single-family units. On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, housing starts as of the end of August 2025 averaged 1.4 million units, a 1.0 percent increase from second quarter 2025. Single-family starts averaged 924 thousand units as of the end of August 2025, a 1.8 percent decrease from second quarter 2025. Multi-family starts averaged 445 thousand units as of the end of August 2025, a 7.5 percent increase from second quarter 2025. Single-family construction is the primary driver for our business as compared to multi-family due to the amount of wood products used. Sales of newly built single-family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 732 thousand units through August 2025, a 9.3 percent increase from second quarter 2025, driven by builder incentives and moderate relief in mortgage rates. Notwithstanding current macroeconomic uncertainty and potential impacts to housing demand, we expect a favorable U.S. housing construction market over the medium to long-term, supported by strong demographics in the key home buying age cohorts and a decade of under building.\nRepair and remodeling expenditures decreased 0.9 percent from second quarter 2025 to the end of August 2025, according to the Census Bureau Advance Retail Spending report. While there continues to be steady demand due to growing home equity and the lock-in effect of lower mortgage rates compared to current rates, many homeowners have been more cautious in discretionary spending on large projects. Recent softness has been reflected in both the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professionally built segments, largely driven by lower consumer confidence, higher interest rates and general uncertainty around the trajectory of the economy. Slower sales of existing homes have also contributed to more subdued activity. Over the longer term, we expect this sector to return to historical growth trends driven by recent deferrals in repair and remodel spending, higher levels of home equity and an aging U.S. housing stock, with a median age of 45 years.\nIn U.S. wood product markets, softer end use demand and steady supply have led to significant price weakness in commodity products. In third quarter 2025, the Random Lengths Framing Lumber Composite price averaged $411/MBF and the OSB Composite averaged $245/MSF. Over the course of third quarter 2025, composite prices for lumber decreased from $422/MBF to $367/MBF and composite prices for OSB decreased from $262/MSF to $237/MSF, both near multi-decade lows on an inflation-adjusted basis. The Framing Lumber Composite began third quarter 2025 on a slight upward trajectory, largely supported by improving Canadian spruce-pine-fir (SPF) pricing and broader concerns around increases in AD/CVD on softwood lumber from Canada, which moved significantly higher in August. As the quarter progressed, demand softened seasonally, and buyer sentiment turned\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nmore cautious. In addition, the persistent supply-demand imbalance in the U.S. worsened in response to elevated shipments of Canadian supply ahead of the increasing duties. Collectively, these dynamics drove composite pricing significantly lower through the balance of the quarter. In October 2025, a 10 percent tariff on U.S. imports of softwood lumber went into effect, which was the result of a Section 232 investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce. For OSB, soft product pricing in third quarter 2025 was largely driven by lower demand from new home construction activity. In September, Weyerhaeuser made a slight reduction to its lumber production levels due to challenging market conditions. The company has maintained a similar operating posture at the outset of the fourth quarter and will continue to assess its operating rates in light of current market conditions on a go-forward basis.\n \nIn Western log markets, Douglas-fir sawlog prices decreased 9.1 percent in third quarter 2025 compared with second quarter 2025, as reported by Fastmarkets RISI Log Lines based on Weyerhaeuser’s sales mix. Log prices in the domestic market faced downward pressure as supply remained ample, and mills continued to carry elevated log inventories while navigating a challenging lumber market. In the South, delivered sawlog prices increased 0.6 percent in third quarter 2025 compared to second quarter 2025 and declined 3.0 percent from third quarter 2024, as reported by TimberMart-South. Delivered pine pulpwood prices decreased 0.4 percent in third quarter 2025 compared to second quarter 2025 and declined 1.9 percent from third quarter 2024 as reported by TimberMart-South. In general, Southern log supply remains ample and wood product and fiber mills continue to align production with end-market demand. Pulpwood prices have been more challenged in several localized regions following recent mill closures.\n \nCurrency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses. In Japan, total housing starts decreased 8.2 percent year-to-date through August compared to the same period in 2024, while the key Post and Beam segment saw a 5.0 percent decrease, in part due to more stringent building permit requirements which went into effect on April 1, 2025. The slowing demand has been partially offset by a decrease in lumber imports to Japan from Europe and reduced inventories of European lumber in the Japanese market. In March 2025, Chinese regulators announced a suspension of log imports from the U.S, which continued through the third quarter.\n \nInterest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy and their influence on our capital management activities. Actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the overall condition of the economy and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are generally correlated with long-term interest rates, decreased from 6.8 percent in second quarter 2025 to 6.3 percent in third quarter 2025, according to economic data from Freddie Mac. Many builders have been able to offset higher mortgage rates through discounts, mortgage rate buydowns and modifying product offerings such as home sizes and finishes. Higher rates have also locked in many existing homeowners from selling, thereby reducing inventories of existing homes for sale which has led to incremental demand for available new homes.\n \nIncreased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. The Consumer Price Index increased at an annual rate of 3.0 percent as of September 2025 compared to 2.7 percent in June 2025. This rate is markedly down from prior periods of elevated inflation. While we can offset some of our costs that are affected by inflation through our sales activities, operational excellence initiatives and procurement practices, not all costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the customer.\n \nThe condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. The unemployment rate increased slightly from 4.1 percent in second quarter 2025 to 4.3 percent as of the end of August 2025.\n \nGovernments and businesses across the globe have publicly expressed that climate change is a compelling issue requiring considerable responsive action; many have made significant commitments toward decarbonizing activities and operations and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving these commitments will require significant efforts, including modifying operations, investing in low-carbon technologies or purchasing credits to reduce environmental impacts. Although political and broader sentiment for climate change mitigation activities and related investments can fluctuate, we expect that over the long-term, climate change will continue to be a significant social concern and priority. With that in mind, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help others achieve climate change mitigation goals through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage activities.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nHow We Did Third Quarter 2025 and Year-to-Date 2025\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQUARTER ENDED\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAMOUNT OF\nCHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYEAR-TO-DATE ENDED\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAMOUNT OF\nCHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE FIGURES\n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025 VS. 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025 VS. 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,717\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,681\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n36\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,364\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,416\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(52\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosts of sales\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,513\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,431\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n82\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,407\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n93\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n123\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n78\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n45\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n480\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n544\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(64\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet earnings\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n80\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n28\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n52\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n315\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(65\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnings per share, basic and diluted\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.08\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \nComparing Third Quarter 2025 with Third Quarter 2024\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nNet sales\n \nNet sales increased $36 million – 2 percent – primarily due to a $29 million increase in Timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers attributable to increased log sales volumes and increased stumpage and pay-as-cut timber sales realizations and sales volumes, as well as a $14 million increase in Real Estate & ENR net sales attributable to an increase in average price per acre sold and an increase in right of way easements and royalty income.

3 percent decrease in sales realizations and a 2 percent decrease in sales volumes, partially due to a lower mix of export sales. This decrease was partially offset by a $7 million increase in Southern log sales attributable to increased sales volumes, as well as a $7 million increase in stumpage and pay-as-cut timber sales attributable to increased sales realizations and sales volumes.\n \nIntersegment sales\n \nIntersegment sales increased $42 million – 10 percent – primarily due to a 6 percent increase in sales

competing properties listed for sale, the seasonal nature of sales, the plans of adjacent landowners, our expectation of future price appreciation, the timing of harvesting activities and the availability of government and not-for-profit funding.

products produced sales include wood chips, other byproducts and third-party residual log sales from our Canadian Forestlands operations.\nComparing Third Quarter 2025 with Third Quarter 2024\n \nNet sales\n \nNet sales decreased $7 million – 1 percent – primarily due to:\n●\na $39 million decrease in oriented strand board sales attributable to a 24 percent decrease in sales realizations, partially offset by an 8 percent increase in sales volumes;\n●\na $13 million decrease in engineered solid section sales attributable to a 10 percent decrease in sales realizations, partially offset by a 2 percent increase in sales volumes;\n●\na $10 million decrease in engineered I-joist sales attributable to an 8 percent decrease in sales realizations and a 3 percent decrease in sales volumes;\n●\na $9 million decrease in complementary building products sales attributable to a decrease in sales volumes across all products and\n●\na $3 million decrease in medium density fiberboard sales attributable to a 6 percent decrease in sales volumes and a 1 percent decrease in sales realizations.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nThese decreases were mostly offset by a $58 million increase in structural lumber sales attributable to a 13 percent increase in sales volumes, as well as a $9 million increase in other products produced sales attributable to an increase in wood chip sales volumes.\n \nCosts of sales\n \nCosts of sales increased $86 million – 8 percent – primarily due to increased sales volumes for structural lumber and oriented strand board.\n \nOperating (loss) income and Net (charge) contribution to earnings\n \nOperating (loss) income and net (charge) contribution to earnings decreased $46 million – 170 percent – primarily due to the change in the components of gross margin, as discussed above, partially offset by a $29 million gain related to the sale of our Princeton lumber mill recorded in third quarter 2025 and a $10 million noncash impairment charge related to the indefinite curtailment of our New Bern lumber mill recorded in third quarter 2024 (refer to the breakout of these items in \nNote 13: Other Operating (Income) Costs, Net\n).\nComparing Year-to-Date 2025 with Year-to-Date 2024\n \nNet sales\n \nNet sales decreased $86 million – 2 percent – primarily due to:\n \n●\na $149 million decrease in oriented strand board sales attributable to a 23 percent decrease in sales realizations, partially offset by a 4 percent increase in sales volumes;\n●\na $51 million decrease in engineered solid section sales attributable to a 9 percent decrease in sales realizations and a 1 percent decrease in sales volumes;\n●\na $46 million decrease in complementary building products sales attributable to a decrease in sales realizations and sales volumes across most products;\n●\na $33 million decrease in engineered I-joist sales attributable to an 8 percent decrease in sales realizations and a 4 percent decrease in sales volumes;\n●\na $16 million decrease in medium density fiberboard sales attributable to a 13 percent decrease in sales volumes and a 1 percent decrease in sales realizations and\n●\na $2 million decrease in softwood plywood sales attributable to a 6 percent decrease in sales realizations, partially offset by a 5 percent increase in sales volumes.\n \nThese decreases were partially offset by a $203 million increase in structural lumber sales attributable to a 9 percent increase in sales volumes and a 6 percent increase in sales realizations, as well as an $8 million increase in other products produced sales attributable to an increase in wood chip sales volumes.\n \nCosts of sales\n \nCosts of sales increased $151 million – 4 percent – primarily due to increased sales volumes for structural lumber, oriented strand board and softwood plywood.\n \nOperating (loss) income and Net (charge) contribution to earnings\n \nOperating (loss) income and net (charge) contribution to earnings decreased $218 million – 62 percent – primarily due to the change in the components of gross margin, as discussed above, as well as a $25 million product remediation recovery recorded in second quarter 2024. These changes were partially offset by a $10 million noncash impairment charge related to the indefinite curtailment of our New Bern lumber mill recorded in third quarter 2024 and a $29 million gain related to the sale of our Princeton lumber mill recorded in third quarter 2025 (refer to the breakout of these items in \nNote 13: Other Operating (Income) Costs, Net\n).\n \nThird-Party Sales Volumes\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQUARTER ENDED\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAMOUNT OF\nCHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYEAR-TO-DATE ENDED\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAMOUNT OF\nCHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLUMES IN MILLIONS\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025 VS. 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025 VS. 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural lumber – board feet\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,259\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,116\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n143\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,674\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,386\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n288\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriented strand board – square feet (3/8”)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n727\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n675\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,177\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,093\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n84\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineered solid section – cubic feet\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineered I-joists – lineal feet\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n110\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n114\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftwood plywood – square feet (3/8”)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n91\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n88\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n271\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n259\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium density fiberboard – square feet (3/4”)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n91\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n104\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(13\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nSales volumes include internally produced products and products purchased for resale primarily through our distribution business.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPRODUCTION AND OUTSIDE PURCHASE VOLUMES\nOutside purchase volumes are primarily purchased for resale through our distribution business.

These changes were partially offset by a $9 million increase in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs and an $8 million decrease in interest income and other, primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents.\n \n \nComparing Year-to-Date 2025 with Year-to-Date 2024\n \nNet charge to earnings increased $11 million – 6 percent – primarily due to:\n●\na $26 million increase in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs;\n●\na $25 million decrease in interest income and other, primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents;\n●\na $13 million increase in unallocated corporate function and variable compensation expense and\n●\na $12 million increase in the charge for elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. \n \nThese changes were partially offset by a $62 million decrease in other, net, primarily attributable to a $28 million increase in insurance recoveries and a $20 million decrease in IT-related project costs.\n \nINTEREST EXPENSE\n \nOur interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was:\n●\n$71 million for third quarter 2025 and $203 million year-to-date 2025;\n●\n$69 million for third quarter 2024 and $203 million year-to-date 2024.\n \nInterest expense increased $2 million compared to third quarter 2024 primarily due to $3 million of debt extinguishment costs incurred in conjunction with the partial redemption of our $750 million 4.75 percent senior unsecured notes due in May 2026. There was no similar activity in third quarter 2024. Year-to-date 2025 interest expense was comparable to year-to-date 2024, primarily due to the third quarter 2025 debt extinguishment costs and a series of debt issuances and retirements in 2025 that increased our outstanding debt, offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate.\nINCOME TAXES\n \nOur provision for income taxes was:\n●\na $41 million benefit for third quarter 2025 and $13 million benefit year-to-date 2025;\n●\na $15 million benefit for third quarter 2024 and $38 million expense year-to-date 2024.\nOur provision for income taxes is primarily driven by the results of our TRSs. Income tax expense decreased $51 million compared to year-to-date 2024, resulting in a net benefit position primarily due to a decrease in our TRS earnings in 2025, as well as a decrease in our estimated effective tax rate.\nRefer to \nNote 14: Income Taxes\n for further information.\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \nWe are committed to maintaining an appropriate capital structure that provides financial flexibility and enables us to protect the interests of our shareholders and meet our obligations to our lenders, while also maintaining access to all major financial markets. As of September 30, 2025, we had $401 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.75 billion of availability on our line of credit, which expires in June 2030. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\nCASH FROM OPERATIONS\n \nConsolidated net cash from operations was:\n●\n$676 million for year-to-date 2025 and\n●\n$790 million for year-to-date 2024.\n \nNet cash from operations decreased $114 million primarily due to decreased cash flows from our business operations, as well as a $12 million increase in cash paid for interest and a $10 million increase in cash paid for income taxes.\nCASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n \nConsolidated net cash from investing activities was:\n●\n$(729) million for year-to-date 2025 and\n●\n$(381) million for year-to-date 2024.\n \nNet cash from investing activities decreased $348 million primarily due to a $331 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions of timberlands, as well as a $58 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures. These changes were partially offset by a $61 million increase in proceeds from the sale of our Princeton lumber mill.\n \n \nSummary of Capital Spending by Business Segment\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYEAR-TO-DATE ENDED\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS\n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimberlands\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n82\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n74\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWood Products\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n243\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n177\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnallocated Items\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n325\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n267\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nDuring fourth quarter 2024, we announced our plan to invest approximately $500 million to build a new TimberStrand\n®\n facility in Monticello, Arkansas. This capital outlay may be sourced from cash on hand or through future financing, as deemed appropriate. Construction began in 2025, with the goal of starting operations in 2027. Once completed, the new facility will increase our engineered wood products capacity by approximately 10 million cubic feet.\n \nWe anticipate our capital expenditures for 2025 to be between $380 and $390 million, excluding approximately $130 million of investment in our Monticello engineered wood products facility. The amount we spend on capital expenditures could change.\nCASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n \nConsolidated net cash from financing activities was:\n●\n$(230) million for year-to-date 2025 and\n●\n$(674) million for year-to-date 2024.\n \nNet cash from financing activities increased $444 million primarily due to a $1,098 million increase in net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, as well as an $85 million decrease in cash paid for dividends. These changes were partially offset by a $712 million increase in payments on long-term debt and a $24 million increase in cash used for repurchases of common stock.\n \nLine of Credit\n \nIn June 2025, we amended and restated our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to extend the expiration date to June 2030, while increasing borrowing capacity from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion. Borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate based on either the adjusted term SOFR plus a spread or a mutually agreed-upon base rate plus a spread. We had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024.\n \n \nRefer to \nNote 8: Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit\n for further information.\n \nLong-Term Debt\n \nDuring third quarter 2025, we entered into an $800 million senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature in August 2028. Net proceeds after fees were $799 million. Borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate based on either the adjusted term SOFR plus a spread or a mutually agreed-upon\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nbase rate plus a spread. Additionally, we utilized approximately $500 million of the net proceeds of the term loan to partially redeem our $750 million 4.75 percent senior unsecured notes due in May 2026.\n \n \nDuring first quarter 2025, we repaid our $139 million 8.50 percent debentures and our $71 million 7.95 percent debentures at maturity. We also entered into a $300 million senior unsecured term loan that will mature in April 2030. Net proceeds after fees were $299 million. Borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate based on either the adjusted term SOFR plus a spread or a mutually agreed-upon base rate plus a spread.\n \nRefer to \nNote 8: Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit\n for further information.\nInterest Rate Swap Hedging Relationship\nDuring third quarter 2025, we entered into interest rate swaps with the risk management objective of managing exposure to interest rate volatility by converting variable rate debt obligations associated with our new $800 million term loan into fixed rate payments. The interest rate swaps provide the right to make fixed rate payments to the counterparty in exchange for variable, SOFR-based payments on a monthly settlement schedule. As of September 30, 2025, our interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million were designated as cash flow hedging instruments of variable, SOFR-based interest payments on our $800 million term loan. No comparable activity was present as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nRefer to \nNote 9: Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n for further information.\nDebt Covenants\n \nAs of September 30, 2025, Weyerhaeuser Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. There have been no significant changes to the debt covenants presented in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our long-term debt instruments, and we expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants for the foreseeable future.\n \nDividend Payments\n \nWe paid cash dividends on common shares of:\n●\n$454 million for year-to-date 2025 and\n●\n$539 million for year-to-date 2024.\nThe decrease in dividends paid is primarily due to a supplemental dividend of $0.14 per share based on 2023 financial results for a total of $102 million paid in first quarter 2024.\n \n \nUnder our cash return framework, we plan to supplement our base dividend with an additional return of variable cash, as appropriate, in the form of a supplemental cash dividend and/or share repurchase to achieve a targeted total return to shareholders of 75 to 80 percent of annual Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution (Adjusted FAD). For further information on Adjusted FAD see \nPerformance and Liquidity Measures\n.\n \nShare Repurchases\nDuring second quarter 2025, we completed the $1 billion purchase authorization under the share repurchase program approved by the board in September 2021 (the 2021 Repurchase Program). On May 8, 2025, we announced the board approved a new share repurchase program (the 2025 Repurchase Program) under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of outstanding shares. Concurrently, the board of directors terminated the completed purchase authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program.\n \nWe repurchased 980,114 common shares for approximately $25 million (including transaction fees) under the 2025 Repurchase Program during third quarter 2025 and 5,714,095 common shares for approximately $150 million (including transaction fees) under the share repurchase programs during year-to-date 2025. During third quarter 2024, we repurchased 820,706 common shares for approximately $26 million (including transaction fees) and 3,962,220 common shares for approximately $125 million (including transaction fees) during year-to-date 2024 under the 2021 Repurchase Program. There were no unsettled shares as of September 30, 2025 and 12,436\n \nunsettled\n \nshares\n \n(less than $1 million) as of December 31, 2024.\n \n \nRefer to \nNote 4: Net Earnings Per Share and Share Repurchases\n for further information.\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPERFORMANCE AND LIQUIDITY MEASURES\n \nAdjusted EBITDA by Segment\n \nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. This measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information for investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQUARTER ENDED\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAMOUNT

lumber mill.\nAdjusted FAD\nWe use Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution (Adjusted FAD) to evaluate the company’s liquidity and measure cash generated during the period (net of capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items) that is available for dividends, repurchases of common shares, debt reduction, acquisitions and other discretionary and nondiscretionary capital allocation activities. Adjusted FAD should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, we believe the measure provides meaningful supplemental information for investors about our liquidity. Adjusted FAD, as we define it, is net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items. Our definition of Adjusted FAD may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry. We reconcile Adjusted FAD to net cash from operations, as that is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted FAD to net cash from operations:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQUARTER ENDED\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYEAR-TO-DATE ENDED\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS\n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash from operations\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n210\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n234\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n676\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n790\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital expenditures\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(125\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(97\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(325\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(267\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAD\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n85\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n137\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n351\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n523\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash from product remediation recovery\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(25\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonticello engineered wood products facility capital expenditures\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted FAD\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n117\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n137\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n421\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n498\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash from investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(521\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(161\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(729\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(381\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash from financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n120\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(171\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(230\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(674\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \nNet Earnings and Net Earnings per Diluted Share Before Special Items\nWe use net earnings before special items and net earnings per diluted share before special items as key performance measures to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company.
