MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the price of crude oil increased slightly relative to second quarter 2025, remaining near the middle of the 10-year historical range (2010-2019) supported by strong demand despite increased OPEC+ supply. Natural gas prices remained at the top of the 10-year range on robust global demand. Global industry refining margins moved toward the top of the 10-year historical range in the third quarter, impacted by industry supply outages coupled with strong demand. Chemical margins remained at bottom of cycle, well below the 10-year range, with continued industry oversupply.\nDuring 2025, the U.S. announced a variety of trade-related actions, including the imposition of tariffs on imports from several countries. In response, many countries announced their own retaliatory tariffs. Despite the current uncertainty as to what effects these actions will ultimately have on the Corporation, our suppliers and our customers, as well as on the overall macroeconomic environment, we do not anticipate any material near-term financial impacts.\nSelected Earnings Driver Definitions\nThe earnings drivers provide additional visibility into our business results. The Corporation evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\nAdvantaged Volume Growth.\n Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products. \n•\nAdvantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects).\n Includes Permian, Guyana, and LNG.\n•\nAdvantaged Projects.\n Includes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns. \n•\nHigh-Value Products.\n Includes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. \nLower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\nBase Volume. \nRepresents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\nStructural Cost Savings. \nRepresents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on \npage \n23\n, including cash operating expenses related to divestments.\nExpenses.\n Represents all expenses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\nTiming Effects.\n Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\n21\nTable of Contents\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items \n(Non-GAAP)\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several segments or several periods. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nUpstream\nEnergy Products\nChemical Products\nSpecialty Products\nCorporate and Financing\nTotal\n(millions of dollars)\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nEarnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\n1,228\n \n4,451\n \n858\n \n982\n \n329\n \n186\n \n354\n \n386\n \n(1,226)\n7,548\n \nIdentified Items\nImpairments\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(155)\n(155)\nRestructuring charges\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(355)\n(355)\nTotal Identified Items\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(510)\n(510)\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items \n(Non-GAAP)\n1,228\n \n4,451\n \n858\n \n982\n \n329\n \n186\n \n354\n \n386\n \n(716)\n8,058\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nUpstream\nEnergy Products\nChemical Products\nSpecialty Products\nCorporate and Financing\nTotal\n(millions of dollars)\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nEarnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\n1,686\n \n4,472\n \n517\n \n792\n \n367\n \n526\n \n375\n \n419\n \n(544)\n8,610\n \nIdentified Items\nTotal Identified Items\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items \n(Non-GAAP)\n1,686\n \n4,472\n \n517\n \n792\n \n367\n \n526\n \n375\n \n419\n \n(544)\n8,610\n \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nUpstream\nEnergy Products\nChemical Products\nSpecialty Products\nCorporate and Financing\nTotal\n(millions of dollars)\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nEarnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\n4,310\n \n13,527\n \n1,980\n \n2,053\n \n839\n \n242\n \n967\n \n1,208\n \n(2,783)\n22,343\n \nIdentified Items\nImpairments\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(155)\n(155)\nRestructuring charges\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(355)\n(355)\nTotal Identified Items\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(510)\n(510)\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items \n(Non-GAAP)\n4,310\n \n13,527\n \n1,980\n \n2,053\n \n839\n \n242\n \n967\n \n1,208\n \n(2,273)\n22,853\n \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nUpstream\nEnergy Products\nChemical Products\nSpecialty Products\nCorporate and Financing\nTotal\n(millions of dollars)\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nEarnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\n5,170\n \n13,722\n \n1,803\n \n1,828\n \n1,397\n \n1,060\n \n1,226\n \n1,080\n \n(1,216)\n26,070\n \nIdentified Items\nTotal Identified Items\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items \n(Non-GAAP)\n5,170\n \n13,722\n \n1,803\n \n1,828\n \n1,397\n \n1,060\n \n1,226\n \n1,080\n \n(1,216)\n26,070\n \nReferences in this discussion to Corporate earnings (loss) mean net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income.

Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative Structural Cost Savings totaled $14.3 billion, which included an additional $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2025. The total change between periods in expenses below will reflect both Structural Cost Savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations, mergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early-stage projects. Structural Cost Savings from new operations, mergers and acquisitions, and new business venture developments are included in the cumulative Structural Cost Savings. Estimates of cumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural Cost Savings are stewarded internally to support management's oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the Corporation's efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management.\nDollars in billions (unless otherwise noted)\nTwelve Months\nEnded December 31,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2019\n2024\n2024\n2025\nComponents of Operating Costs\nFrom ExxonMobil’s Consolidated Statement of Income\n(U.S. GAAP)\nProduction and manufacturing expenses\n36.8 \n39.6 \n28.8 \n30.3 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n11.4 \n10.0 \n7.4 \n8.1 \nDepreciation and depletion (includes impairments)\n19.0 \n23.4 \n16.9 \n18.3 \nExploration expenses, including dry holes\n1.3 \n0.8 \n0.6 \n0.5 \nNon-service pension and postretirement benefit expense\n1.2 \n0.1 \n0.1 \n0.3 \nSubtotal\n69.7\n \n74.0\n \n53.7\n \n57.4\n \nExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenses (Non-GAAP)\n9.1 \n9.6 \n7.1 \n7.8 \nTotal Adjusted Operating Costs \n(Non-GAAP)\n78.8\n \n83.6\n \n60.8\n \n65.3\n \nTotal Adjusted Operating Costs \n(Non-GAAP)\n78.8\n \n83.6\n \n60.8\n \n65.3\n \nLess:\nDepreciation and depletion (includes impairments)\n19.0 \n23.4 \n16.9 \n18.3 \nNon-service pension and postretirement benefit expense\n1.2 \n0.1 \n0.1 \n0.3 \nOther adjustments (includes equity company depreciation \nand depletion)\n3.6 \n3.7 \n2.5 \n3.7 \nTotal Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex)\n (Non-GAAP)\n55.0\n \n56.4\n \n41.3\n \n43.0\n \nEnergy and production taxes (Non-GAAP)\n11.0 \n13.9 \n10.3 \n11.2 \nTotal Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes\n (Non-GAAP)\n44.0\n \n42.5\n \n31.0\n \n31.8\n \nChange\n vs \n2019\nChange \nvs \n2024\nEstimated Cumulative vs \n2019\nTotal Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes\n (Non-GAAP)\n-1.5\n+0.8\nMarket\n+4.0\n+0.5\nActivity / Other\n+6.6\n+2.5\nStructural Cost Savings\n-12.1\n-2.2\n-14.3\nDue to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated. \n23\nTable of Contents\nREVIEW OF THIRD QUARTER 2025 RESULTS\nExxonMobil’s third quarter 2025 earnings were $7.5 billion, compared to $8.6 billion a year earlier. The decrease in earnings was mainly driven by weaker crude prices, lower chemical margins, and higher expenses from growth initiatives; partly offset by stronger refining margins, increased volumes from advantaged Upstream investments in Guyana and the Permian, and Structural Cost Savings from base efficiencies and divestments. Cash capital expenditures were $8.6 billion, up $2.2 billion from third quarter 2024.\nEarnings for the first nine months of 2025 were $22.3 billion, compared to $26.1 billion a year earlier. Cash capital expenditures were $20.9 billion, up $2.7 billion from the first nine months of 2024. The Corporation distributed $12.9 billion in dividends to shareholders and repurchased $14.9 billion of common stock.\nUPSTREAM\nUpstream Financial Results\n(millions of dollars)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nEarnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\nUnited States\n1,228 \n1,686 \n4,310 \n5,170 \nNon-U.S.\n4,451 \n4,472 \n13,527 \n13,722 \nTotal\n5,679\n \n6,158\n \n17,837\n \n18,892\n \nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items \n(1)\n \n(Non-GAAP)\nUnited States\n1,228 \n1,686 \n4,310 \n5,170 \nNon-U.S.\n4,451 \n4,472 \n13,527 \n13,722 \nTotal\n5,679\n \n6,158\n \n17,837\n \n18,892\n \n(1) \nRefer to page \n22\n for definition of Identified Items and earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items.\n24\nTable of Contents\nUpstream Third Quarter Earnings Driver Analysis \n(millions of dollars)\nPrice – Price impacts decreased earnings by $1,510 million, mainly driven by lower liquids realizations.\nAdvantaged Volume Growth – Increased earnings by $630 million, mainly driven by Permian and Guyana growth.\nBase Volume – Decreased earnings by $380 million as a result of non-strategic asset divestments.\nStructural Cost Savings – Increased earnings by $330 million.\nExpenses – Decreased earnings by $10 million.\nOther – Increased earnings by $340 million, primarily driven by one-time tax items.\nTiming Effects – Increased earnings by $120 million, mainly from the absence of unfavorable derivatives mark-to-market impacts.\nUpstream Year-to-Date Earnings Driver Analysis \n(millions of dollars)\nPrice\n \n– Price impacts decreased earnings by $3,980 million, driven by lower liquids realizations on higher industry supply.\nAdvantaged Volume Growth – Increased earnings by $1,500 million, mainly driven by Permian and Guyana growth.\nBase Volume – Decreased earnings by $450 million as a result of non-strategic asset divestments, partially offset by ramp-up of the Tengiz expansion.\nStructural Cost Savings – Increased earnings by $960 million.\nExpenses – Decreased earnings by $480 million, primarily from higher depreciation on the Tengiz expansion.\nOther – Increased earnings by $850 million, driven by favorable foreign exchange effects and tax items.\nTiming Effects – Increased earnings by $540 million from favorable derivatives mark-to-market impacts and the absence of unfavorable prior year impacts.\n25\nTable of Contents\nUpstream Operational Results\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen and synthetic oil \n(thousands of barrels daily)\n \n \n \n \nUnited States\n1,512 \n1,444 \n1,475 \n1,174 \nCanada/Other Americas\n863 \n772 \n807 \n770 \nEurope\n3 \n4 \n3 \n4 \nAfrica\n145 \n199 \n140 \n213 \nAsia\n830 \n734 \n809 \n719 \nAustralia/Oceania\n27 \n34 \n25 \n31 \nWorldwide\n3,380\n \n3,187\n \n3,261\n \n2,911\n \nNet natural gas production available for sale \n(millions of cubic feet daily)\nUnited States\n3,440 \n3,140 \n3,340 \n2,762 \nCanada/Other Americas\n23 \n103 \n30 \n103 \nEurope\n265 \n350 \n302 \n353 \nAfrica\n118 \n140 \n114 \n152 \nAsia\n3,157 \n3,347 \n3,272 \n3,369 \nAustralia/Oceania\n1,332 \n1,289 \n1,282 \n1,254 \nWorldwide\n8,334\n \n8,369\n \n8,341\n \n7,993\n \n \nOil-equivalent production \n(1)\n(thousands of oil-equivalent barrels daily)\n4,769 \n4,582 \n4,651 \n4,243 \n(1)\n Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels.\nDue to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\n26\nTable of Contents\nUpstream Additional Information\n(thousands of barrels daily)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nVolumes reconciliation (Oil-equivalent production) \n(1)\n \n2024\n4,582\n \n4,243\n \nEntitlements - Net Interest\n— \n(31)\nEntitlements - Price / Spend / Other\n14 \n27 \nGovernment Mandates\n— \n(1)\nDivestments\n(115)\n(135)\nGrowth / Other\n288 \n548 \n2025\n4,769\n \n4,651\n \n(1) \nNatural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels.\nDue to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\n3Q 2025\nversus \n3Q 2024 \n3Q 2025 production of 4.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day increased 187 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day from 3Q 2024, driven by Permian and Guyana growth.\nYTD 2025\nversus \nYTD 2024 \n4.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2025 increased 408 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day from 2024, driven by Permian production.\nListed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation drivers which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.\nEntitlements - Net Interest\n are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining drivers. These drivers consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices. \nEntitlements - Price / Spend / Other\n are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining drivers. These drivers include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such drivers can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements. \nGovernment Mandates\n are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions imposed by governments.\nDivestments\n are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. \nGrowth and Other\n comprise all other operational and non-operational drivers not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such drivers include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.\n27\nTable of Contents\nENERGY PRODUCTS\nEnergy Products Financial Results\n(millions of dollars)\nThree Months

to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.\nCash flow from operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2025 was $14.9 billion, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the comparable 2024 period. \nCash provided by operating activities totaled $39.3 billion for the first nine months of 2025, $3.5 billion lower than 2024. Net income including noncontrolling interests was $23.2 billion, a decrease of $4.0 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $18.3 billion for depreciation and depletion was up $1.4 billion from 2024. Changes in operational working capital were a reduction of $5.0 billion during the period. All other items net increased cash flows by $2.9 billion in 2025 versus a decrease of $0.9 billion in 2024. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details.\nInvesting activities for the first nine months of 2025 used net cash of $18.8 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $20.9 billion was $3.4 billion higher than 2024. Proceeds from asset sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion compared to the prior year. Net investments and advances decreased $0.7 billion from $0.7 billion in 2024. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $30.3 billion in the first nine months of 2025, including $14.9 billion for the purchase of 136 million shares of ExxonMobil stock, as part of the previously announced buyback program. This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $31.6 billion in the prior year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter of 2025 was $42.0 billion compared to $41.7 billion at year-end 2024. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 13.5 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2025 compared to 13.4 percent at year-end 2024. The net debt to capital ratio \n(1)\n was 9.5 percent at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 3.0 percentage points from year-end 2024. The Corporation's capital allocation priorities are investing in competitively advantaged, high-return projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and sharing our success with our shareholders through more consistent share repurchases and a growing dividend. The Corporation distributed a total of $12.9 billion to shareholders in the first nine months of 2025 through dividends.\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. Commercial paper is used to balance short-term liquidity requirements and is reflected in \"Notes and loans payable\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in outstanding commercial paper between periods included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $0.4 billion as of the end of third quarter 2025. On October 2, 2025, the Corporation established a 364-day revolving credit facility of $7.0 billion to provide short-term borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes.\n(1)\n Net debt is total debt of $42.0 billion less $13.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash . Net debt to capital ratio is net debt divided by net debt plus total equity of $268.2 billion. Total debt is the sum of notes and loans payable and long-term debt, as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include strategic fit, cost synergies, potential for future growth, low cost of supply, and attractive valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.\nLitigation and other contingencies are discussed in \nNote \n3\n to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. Through the third quarter of 2025, the Corporation entered into a long-term purchase agreement with an estimated total obligation of approximately $2.3 billion. \nTAXES\n(millions of dollars)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIncome taxes\n3,164 \n4,055 \n10,082 \n11,952 \nEffective income tax rate\n32%\n35%\n34%\n35%\nTotal other taxes and duties \n(1)\n7,319 \n7,609 \n21,589 \n22,300 \nTotal\n10,483\n \n11,664\n \n31,671\n \n34,252\n \n(1) \nIncludes “Other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are included in “Production and manufacturing expenses” and “Selli\nng, general and administrative expenses”, each from the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nTotal taxes were $10.5 billion for the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $1.2 billion from 2024. Income tax expense was $3.2 billion compared to $4.1 billion in the prior year. The effective income tax rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and ExxonMobil's share of equity company income taxes, was 32 percent, lower than the prior year period due primarily to favorable one-time items. Total other taxes and duties decreased by $0.3 billion to $7.3 billion.\nTotal taxes were $31.7 billion for the first nine months of 2025, a decrease of $2.6 billion from 2024. Income tax expense decreased by $1.9 billion to $10.1 billion reflecting lower commodity prices. The effective income tax rate of 34 percent was down compared to the prior year period due primarily to favorable one-time items.

future debt levels and credit ratings; business and project plans, timing, costs, capacities and profitability; resource recoveries and production rates; and planned Denbury and Pioneer integrated benefits, could differ materially due to a number of factors.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThese include global or regional changes or imbalances in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market factors; economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations that impact prices, differentials, and volume/mix for our products; developments or changes in local, national, or international laws, regulations, taxes, trade sanctions, trade tariffs, or policies affecting our business, such as government policies supporting lower carbon and new market investment opportunities, the punitive European taxes on the oil and gas sector and unequal support for different technological methods of emissions reduction or evolving, ambiguous and unharmonized standards or extraterritorial laws and regulations imposed by various jurisdictions related to sustainability and greenhouse gas reporting;

and other factors discussed under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of ExxonMobil’s 2024 Form 10-K.\nForward-looking and other statements regarding environmental and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are not an indication that these statements are material to investors or require disclosure in our filing with the SEC or any other regulatory authority. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental and other sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future rule-making.\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil’s 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on ExxonMobil’s Global Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil’s business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect investment decisions made by ExxonMobil or its affiliates. Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Corporate planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our Corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set and public policy support, and focused on returns.\nThe term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports."
