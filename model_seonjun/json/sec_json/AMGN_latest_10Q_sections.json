MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with GAAP. Amgen operates in one operating segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.\nForward-looking statements\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases, written statements or our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume” and “continue” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II herein and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecasted by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, EPS, liquidity and capital resources, trends, planned dividends, stock repurchases, and collaborations. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.\nOverview\nAmgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines to fight some of the world’s toughest diseases. We focus on areas of high unmet medical need and leverage our expertise to strive for solutions that dramatically improve people’s lives, while also reducing the social and economic burden of disease. We helped launch the biotechnology industry more than 40 years ago and have grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies. Our robust pipeline includes potential first-in-class medicines at all stages of development.\nOur principal products are Prolia, Repatha, ENBREL, Otezla, XGEVA, EVENITY, TEPEZZA, BLINCYTO, Nplate, KYPROLIS, Aranesp, TEZSPIRE, KRYSTEXXA and Vectibix. We also market a number of other products, including but not limited to MVASI, PAVBLU, AMJEVITA/AMGEVITA, UPLIZNA, IMDELLTRA/IMDYLLTRA, TAVNEOS, RAVICTI, Neulasta, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, Parsabiv, Aimovig, WEZLANA/WEZENLA and PROCYSBI.\nTariffs and trade protection measures\nNumerous tariffs and trade protection measures have been proposed, and in a number of cases, implemented by the United States and other countries. These tariffs and trade protection measures include the universal 10% tariff on goods imported into the United States, the July Tariff EOs imposing additional country-specific tariffs for more than 60 countries, the trade framework with the EU effective September 2025 that imposes a baseline 15% tariff on most goods from the EU, bilateral trade deals with certain other countries such as Vietnam, Japan and the United Kingdom for special tariff rates, China’s country-specific tariff that is expected to become effective on November 10, 2025, and retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. These tariffs and trade protection measures may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, there are a number of proposed and potential sector-specific tariffs on our industry that are in development. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors\n—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business, \nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. While existing tariffs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, certain tariffs that are currently in effect, or anticipated to take effect in the future, are expected to further increase our manufacturing and operating expenses in future quarters, including the cost to deliver products to markets, cost of sourcing materials for the manufacturing of our products and cost of materials used in our R&D activities. Furthermore, such tariffs may increasingly affect the cost to expand our manufacturing capacity in the United \n30\nStates, including increased construction costs and/or delays in construction for our Ohio and North Carolina facilities. Additionally, retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries may adversely affect our business, operations and delivery and launches of products in such markets, including the performance of our collaborations in such markets. However, the degree of adverse effects from any tariffs on our business and operations in future periods will depend on various factors, including the application and rates of such tariffs, as well as the expansion of such tariffs to include certain goods (such as pharmaceutical products), the magnitude of response by other countries to U.S. tariffs and the length of time such tariffs are in effect. For additional discussion of these and other risks, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nMacroeconomic and other challenges\nUncertain macroeconomic conditions, including the risk of inflation, fluctuating interest rates and instability in the financial system, as well as rising healthcare costs, continue to pose challenges to our business. Uncertainty around tariffs and trade protection measures in the United States and other countries, including the imposition of new, retaliatory or sector-specific tariffs, along with ongoing geopolitical conflicts and rising geopolitical tensions, continue to create additional uncertainty in global macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, with public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to be subject to cost containment measures and significant pricing pressures, resulting in net price declines.\nMoreover, provisions of the IRA, as well as the 340B Program, have negatively affected, and are likely to continue to negatively affect, our business. For example, ENBREL and Otezla have been selected by CMS for Medicare price setting beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In addition to the IRA, other recent and proposed U.S. policy actions focus on drug pricing, including the Most-Favored-Nations Prescription Drug Pricing Executive Order (MFN EO) that is aimed at using price benchmarks from other developed countries to set U.S. pricing targets, and the July MFN Letter that was delivered to many pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen, and called for drug manufacturers to: 1) extend MFN pricing to Medicaid; 2) guarantee MFN pricing to Medicaid, Medicare and commercial payers on all newly launched drugs; 3) use future increased revenues from outside the United States to reduce U.S. drug prices; and 4) participate in direct-to-consumer models to provide MFN pricing for certain drugs. The details of these drug pricing actions and how they might be operationalized are unclear, but if put into place they could reasonably be expected to adversely affect our business. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors\n—Changing U.S. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, access to, pricing of, and sales of our products,\n of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion.\nFinally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These buying patterns can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales, but have generally not been significant to date when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. For additional discussion of these and other risks, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nSignificant developments\nThe following is a summary of select significant developments affecting our business that occurred since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. For additional developments, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025.\nProducts/pipeline\nRepatha\nIn August 2025, we announced that the FDA broadened the approved use of Repatha\n \nto include adults at increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) due to uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The update removes a prior requirement for a patient to have been diagnosed with cardiovascular (CV) disease.\nIn October 2025, we announced that the Phase 3 VESALIUS-CV trial met its dual primary endpoints demonstrating that Repatha significantly reduced the risk of MACE in individuals without a prior history of heart attack or stroke. No new safety signals were observed.\nTEZSPIRE\nIn October 2025, we announced that the FDA approved TEZSPIRE for the add-on maintenance treatment of inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.\nBemarituzumab\nIn November 2025, we announced that FORTITUDE-102, a Phase 1b/3 study of bemarituzumab plus chemotherapy and nivolumab in patients with first-line gastric cancer, was stopped.\n31\nSelected financial information\nThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data):\n \nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nProduct sales\nU.S.\n$\n6,751 \n$\n5,979 \n13 \n%\n$\n18,737 \n$\n16,792 \n12 \n%\nROW\n2,386 \n2,172 \n10 \n%\n7,044 \n6,518 \n8 \n%\nTotal product sales\n9,137 \n8,151 \n12 \n%\n25,781 \n23,310 \n11 \n%\nOther revenues\n420 \n352 \n19 \n%\n1,104 \n1,028 \n7 \n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n9,557 \n$\n8,503 \n12 \n%\n$\n26,885 \n$\n24,338 \n10 \n%\nOperating expenses\n$\n7,031 \n$\n6,456 \n9 \n%\n$\n20,525 \n$\n19,391 \n6 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n2,526 \n$\n2,047 \n23 \n%\n$\n6,360 \n$\n4,947 \n29 \n%\nNet income\n$\n3,216 \n$\n2,830 \n14 \n%\n$\n6,378 \n$\n3,463 \n84 \n%\nDiluted EPS\n$\n5.93 \n$\n5.22 \n14 \n%\n$\n11.77 \n$\n6.40 \n84 \n%\nDiluted shares\n542 \n542 \n— \n%\n542 \n541 \n0 \n%\nIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies) as may be noted.\nTotal product sales increased 12% and 11% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, driven by volume growth of 14% for both periods, partially offset by declines in net selling price of 4% and 3%, respectively.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, U.S. volume grew 13% and ROW volume grew 16%, driven by volume growth in certain brands, including PAVBLU, Repatha, EVENITY, IMDELLTRA/IMDYLLTRA, TEZSPIRE and BLINCYTO.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, U.S. and ROW volumes grew 14% each, driven by volume growth in certain brands, including Repatha, PAVBLU, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, IMDELLTRA/IMDYLLTRA and BLINCYTO.\nFor the remainder of 2025, we expect volume growth from certain brands to be partially offset by net selling price declines.\nOther revenues increased 19% and 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, primarily driven by higher royalty income.\nOperating expenses increased 9% and 6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, driven by investments in Later-Stage Clinical Programs and Otezla intangible asset impairment charges, partially offset by lower amortization expense from the fair value step-up of inventory acquired from Horizon. See Note 8, Goodwill and other intangible assets, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, for additional information related to the Otezla intangible asset impairment charges.\nUncertain macroeconomic conditions, including uncertainty around tariffs and trade protection measures, ongoing geopolitical conflicts and rising geopolitical tensions, changes in the healthcare ecosystem, and potential government policy actions, including MFN pricing or similar drug pricing reforms, have the potential to introduce variability into product sales. Furthermore, product sales continue to be impacted by actions from governments and other entities to address macroeconomic challenges, provisions of the IRA, inappropriate expanded utilization of the 340B Program and growth in numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Reimbursement, and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025.\n32\nResults of operations\nProduct sales\nWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\n \nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nProlia \n$\n1,139 \n$\n1,045 \n9 \n%\n$\n3,360 \n$\n3,209 \n5 \n%\nRepatha\n794 \n567 \n40 \n%\n2,146 \n1,616 \n33 \n%\nENBREL\n580 \n825 \n(30)\n%\n1,694 \n2,301 \n(26)\n%\nOtezla\n585 \n564 \n4 \n%\n1,640 \n1,502 \n9 \n%\nXGEVA\n539 \n541 \n0 \n%\n1,637 \n1,664 \n(2)\n%\nEVENITY\n541 \n399 \n36 \n%\n1,501 \n1,132 \n33 \n%\nTEPEZZA\n560 \n488 \n15 \n%\n1,446 \n1,391 \n4 \n%\nBLINCYTO\n392 \n327 \n20 \n%\n1,146 \n835 \n37 \n%\nNplate\n457 \n456 \n0 \n%\n1,139 \n1,119 \n2 \n%\nKYPROLIS\n359 \n378 \n(5)\n%\n1,061 \n1,131 \n(6)\n%\nAranesp\n357 \n337 \n6 \n%\n1,056 \n1,034 \n2 \n%\nTEZSPIRE\n(1)\n377 \n269 \n40 \n%\n1,004 \n676 \n49 \n%\nKRYSTEXXA\n320 \n310 \n3 \n%\n905 \n839 \n8 \n%\nVectibix\n284 \n282 \n1 \n%\n856 \n799 \n7 \n%\nOther products\n(2)\n1,853 \n1,363 \n36 \n%\n5,190 \n4,062 \n28 \n%\nTotal product sales\n$\n9,137 \n$\n8,151 \n12 \n%\n$\n25,781 \n$\n23,310 \n11 \n%\n____________\n(1)    \nTEZSPIRE is marketed by our collaborator AstraZeneca outside the United States.\n(2)    \nConsists of product sales of our non-principal products.\nFuture sales of our products\n \nwill depend in part on the factors discussed below and in the following sections of this report: (i) Part I, Item 2.

See Note 6, Investments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily due to the change in earnings mix, including lower amortization expense from the fair value step-up of inventory acquired from Horizon. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily due to the change in earnings mix, including the net unrealized gains on equity investments in the first nine months of 2025 compared to those in the prior-year period (see Note 6, Investments) and partially offset by the year-to-date Otezla impairment charges and related tax impacts (see Note 8, Goodwill and other intangible assets).\nAs previously reported, the OECD reached an agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. Effective January 1, 2024, select individual countries, including the United Kingdom and EU member countries, have enacted the global minimum tax agreement. Additional countries, including Singapore, enacted the minimum tax agreement, effective January 1, 2025. Singapore’s enactment of the agreement applies irrespective of the Company’s incentive grant. Due to the currently enacted scope of the agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries are now subject to a 15% minimum tax rate on adjusted financial statement income. In June 2025, the United States and the other six countries that make up the G7 nations jointly announced that U.S. companies would be exempted from certain minimum taxes related to the OECD agreement. However, significant details regarding the G7 announcement remain uncertain and individual countries that have enacted the OECD agreement, including countries not within the G7, must amend their local legislation for the G7 announcement to become effective. The continued response of other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico to the OECD agreement and the G7 announcement remains highly uncertain. The continued enactment of the OECD agreement, either by all OECD participants or unilaterally by individual countries, could result in tax increases or double taxation in the United States or foreign jurisdictions.\nOn July 4, 2025, OB3 was enacted in the United States. OB3 has various provisions, including the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and modifications to the international tax framework. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2026 and beyond. The impact of these changes on our deferred tax assets and liabilities was recorded in the third quarter of 2025 and did not have a material effect on our effective tax rate or on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010–2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010–2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010–2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion, plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2010–2012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued and paid on our foreign earnings.\n41\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013–2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010–2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013–2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013–2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013–2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued and paid on our foreign earnings.\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in the U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022. The trial began on November 4, 2024 and concluded on January 17, 2025. The parties filed opening post-trial briefs on June 13, 2025, and the Court held oral argument on July 16, 2025. The parties filed post-trial reply briefs on October 10, 2025. The Company expects a decision from the U.S. Tax Court no earlier than the second half of 2026.\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016–2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. We expect that the IRS will begin its audit of 2019–2022 in 2025 or early 2026, and we believe that it may seek to continue to audit similar issues related to the allocation of income between the United States and our foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.\nFinal resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nSee our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors—\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities, including from an adverse outcome in our ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and other tax examinations, enactment of the OECD minimum corporate tax rate agreement and the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation including the OBBBA. Such tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations, \nand Note 4, Income taxes, to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion.\nFinancial condition, liquidity and capital resources\nSelected financial data were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n9,445 \n$\n11,973 \nTotal assets\n$\n90,141 \n$\n91,839 \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$\n2,153 \n$\n3,550 \nLong-term debt\n$\n52,434 \n$\n56,549 \nStockholders’ equity\n$\n9,619 \n$\n5,877 \nCash and cash equivalents\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents was $9.4 billion as of September 30, 2025. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\nCapital allocation\nConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including investments in innovation both internally and externally (including \n42\ninvestments that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), capital expenditures, repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases.\nWe intend to continue investing in our business while reducing our debt and returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. This reflects our desire to optimize our cost of capital and our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, debt levels and debt service requirements, our credit rating, availability of financing on acceptable terms, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company’s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include block purchases, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases and market transactions.\nIn August 2025, March 2025 and December 2024, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $2.38 per share of common stock, which were paid in September 2025, June 2025 and March 2025, respectively, an increase of 6% over the quarterly cash dividends paid each quarter in 2024. In October 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.38 per share of common stock, which will be paid in December 2025.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we did not repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program. As of September 30, 2025, $6.8 billion of authorization remained available under the stock repurchase program.\nAs a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, debt repayments totaled $5.0 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. In addition, we opportunistically repurchase our debt when market conditions are favorable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we repurchased aggregate principal amounts of our debt of $1.0 billion and $875 million, respectively, for aggregate costs of $683 million and $659 million, respectively, which resulted in the recognition of gains on extinguishment of debt of $264 million and $215 million, respectively, recorded in Other income, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. \nWe believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, as well as our plans to reduce debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors—\nGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business,\n of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCertain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and term loan credit agreement include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the respective agreements. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of September 30, 2025.\n43\nCash flows\nOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):\n \nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n8,355 \n$\n6,719 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(1,250)\n$\n(644)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(9,633)\n$\n(8,008)\nOperating\nCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher net income in the current year period after adjustments for noncash items, the timing of tax payments, including an $800 million tax deposit made in the first quarter of 2024, and the timing of working capital items.\nInvesting\nCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, was primarily due to capital expenditures of $1.2 billion and $725 million, respectively, including construction costs for new plants and expansion of manufacturing capacity. We currently estimate full year 2025 investments in capital projects to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion.\nFinancing\nCash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily due to the repayment and extinguishment of debt of $5.0 billion and $683 million, respectively, and the payment of dividends of $3.8 billion. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the repayment and extinguishment of debt of $3.6 billion and $659 million, respectively, and the payment of dividends of $3.6 billion. See Note 9, Financing arrangements, and Note 10, Stockholders’ equity, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates is presented in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nRecently issued accounting standards\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1, Significant accounting policies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n44"
