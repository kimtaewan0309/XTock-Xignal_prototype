  "item1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nWe operate a global marketplace, where hosts offer guests stays and experiences on our platform. We are a community based on connection and belonging—a community that was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 2 billion guest arrivals in almost every country and region across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.\nAirbnb has five stakeholders and is designed with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive. \nOur Long-Term Growth Strategy \nOur key strategic priorities include perfecting our core business, accelerating growth in global markets, and launching and scaling new offerings. Over the past several years, we have introduced hundreds of new features and upgrades to our platform spanning nearly every part of our service from pricing to quality to customer support. Additionally, we are leveraging our global markets strategy, which includes a more localized approach to product updates and marketing investments to raise awareness and consideration in less mature markets. Lastly, we are planning to expand our business beyond travel accommodations using our multi-year product roadmap to help drive long-term growth across new businesses.\nOur Platform \nOur Platform for Hosts \nWe built our platform to seamlessly onboard new hosts, especially those who previously had not considered hosting. We partner with hosts throughout the process of setting up their listing and provide them with a robust suite of tools to successfully manage their listings, including scheduling, merchandising, integrated payments, community support, host protections, pricing tools, and feedback from reviews. During 2024, we introduced Co-Host Network, which enables our hosts to find co-hosts who can help manage their listing. Co-hosts are experienced hosts who provide personalized support based on the hosts’ needs, from listing setup to managing bookings and communicating with guests. \nOur Platform for Guests \nOur website and mobile app provide our guests with an engaging way to explore and easily book a wide variety of unique homes and experiences. Over the last several years, we have launched a significant number of new features and upgrades through our biannual product releases to help guests find affordable, high quality and reliable stays across the platform.\nOur System of Trust \nThe system for trust that we have designed includes the following components: host and guest reviews, account protection, risk scoring, secure payments, a nondiscrimination policy, watchlist and background checks in certain jurisdictions, cleanliness, fraud and scam prevention, insurance and similar protections, booking restrictions, an urgent safety line, a 24/7 neighborhood support line, anti-party technology, and a guest refund policy. \nWe offer protection for our hosts through AirCover for Hosts. AirCover for Hosts includes, among other features, guest property damage protection of up to $3 million per stay, liability coverage to hosts of up to $1 million per occurrence in the event of third-party claims of personal injury or property damage, deep cleaning protection, and pet damage protection. \nWe also offer AirCover for guests, which provides support for serious issues with a booking or during a stay, including host cancellations, inability to check-in, inaccurate listings, and a 24-hour safety support line. \nWe have new initiatives under development and will continue to create additional safety features to strengthen the trust and safety on our platform. \nOur Technology \nOur technology platform powers our two-sided marketplace and enables our global network of hosts and guests. Given the nature of the business, our technology platform has broad and complex requirements: \n•\nSupport of global payments\n. It enables guests and hosts to send and receive money in their preferred currency, supporting approximately 20 local payment methods. Designed for scalability and reliability, the platform ensures secure transactions through advanced protections against fraud and money laundering.\n•\nDelivery of global community support\n. It provides multilingual, real-time community safety and support, and city-specific regulatory support.\n4\nTable of Contents\n•\nDelivery of deep business insights\n. It delivers deep business intelligence insights to manage our marketplace, including pricing insights and occupancy optimization for our hosts. \n•\nIncorporation of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning\n. It incorporates sophisticated AI into key areas, from fraud detection, to personalized listing matching and enabling customized and real-time community support. \n•\nOperation of a microservices architecture\n. We operate a microservices architecture and are evolving our foundational components to enable us to move rapidly in response to evolving customer needs without sacrificing correctness or stability.\n As we continue to evolve our foundational technology, we are focused on the following broad capabilities: \n•\nData management systems that are designed to support user privacy, analytics, machine learning/AI, and business insights. \n•\nService reliability leading to best-in-class performance centered on availability, latency, disaster recovery and business continuity, security, testability, observability, operability, and agility. \n•\nCloud support focusing on robust capabilities for granular attribution and usage patterns to realize efficiency gains. \nThese continued technological investments aim to create a robust platform that allows us to more quickly adapt to the needs of our hosts and guests around the world and increase the productivity of our product development organization. \nOur Marketing \nOur marketing strategy includes brand marketing, communications, and performance marketing. Brand marketing increases awareness among potential hosts and guests, helping them understand the benefits of hosting and booking stays and experiences, and what makes these stays and experiences distinctly Airbnb. Our global communications team works across press, policy, and online influencers to share timely and important news about Airbnb. They also oversee the execution of a global consumer, product, corporate, and policy-communications plan that supports our brand strategy and generates considerable press and social media coverage. While performance marketing is one component of our multi-pronged strategy, the strength of the Airbnb brand and our communications strategy allows us to be less reliant on performance marketing. \nOur Human Capital\nWe consider the management of our global talent to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 7,300 employees.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we relied on a global network of approximately 11,000 third-party workers to handle the vast majority of our community support contacts. Our internal community support employees are comprised of operations teams who handle complex and sensitive issues, and enablement teams who support all community-facing teams, including our partners.\nAttracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining talent from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences enables us to provide our hosts and guests with innovative products and services as well as serve our other stakeholders. Through our hiring process, we commit to finding the best, most qualified candidates for each role, while encouraging inclusion and eliminating bias. We are also focused on supporting all of our employees in continuing to grow and develop throughout the employee lifecycle. \nOur Live and Work Anywhere policy allows for the vast majority of our employees to work remotely. We believe that expanding our talent pool beyond the commuting radius near our offices will allow us to attract the best employees over time, as it helps us to have a broader and more diverse range of qualified candidates for any given position. We aim to create a highly coordinated working culture, and as such, will continue to promote ways to keep employees highly engaged and connected by aligning employees’ work through our product roadmap, as well as curating employee collaboration sessions either in the office or at off-site locations.\nClimate Change\nIn 2021, we committed to a goal to operate as a net zero company for our global corporate operations by 2030, reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with our corporate operations across Scope 1 (direct emissions from stationary combustion and refrigerants), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased electricity, diesel generators and district heat), and the following Scope 3 categories defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2), waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, and upstream leased assets. To help meet our goals, we are implementing a broad range of initiatives designed to help decarbonize our business and make our corporate operations more sustainable. \nWe also purchase, and plan to continue purchasing, carbon credits to fully achieve our emissions goals in the long-term. Our aim is to procure such credits from high integrity projects, with a focus on nature-based solutions or projects with other co-benefits where feasible.\nRegulations\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term and long-term rental and home sharing business at city, state, country, and regional levels. While a number of cities, counties, states and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations. \n5\nTable of Contents\nWe seek to work with governments to establish clear, fair, and workable home sharing rules to create clarity for our hosts, however certain cities have passed onerous restrictions on short-term rentals. For example, New York City passed regulations in 2023, which resulted in a de facto ban of short-term rental activities. Other smaller cities have also passed onerous restrictions on short-term rentals. We will continue to collaborate with policymakers to implement sensible legislation around the world and/or dispute regulations that unreasonably restrict the right to host. \nIn addition to laws, regulations, and rules directly applicable to the short-term and long-term rental and home sharing business, we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and rules governing our business practices. These include those related to the Internet, Internet access, e-commerce, and electronic devices, and those involving taxation, privacy, data privacy, data security, insurance, pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, employment, protection of minors, copyrights, distribution, messaging, mobile communications, use of AI, electronic device certification, electronic waste, electronic contracts, communications, competition, and unfair commercial practices. We are also subject to laws, regulations, and rules governing the provision of online payment services, the design and operation of our platform, and the operations, characteristics, and quality of our platform and services. Additionally, we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and numerous foreign jurisdictions.\nOur payments platform is subject to various laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance, including those governing cross-border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers, stored value and prepaid access, foreign exchange, data privacy, data security, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, economic and trade sanctions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing.\nOur business collects, processes, and uses the personal data of individuals across the globe. As a result, we must comply with certain laws on data privacy and data security regulating the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, security, and other processing of personal data. We take a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols designed to protect personal data, including data pertaining to hosts, guests, employees, and others.\nLegal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, security and other processing of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. This increases the complexity of compliance requirements, may limit offerings, and result in additional expenses while also diverting attention and resources from other projects. Regulators around the world continue to propose more stringent data privacy and data security laws, and these laws are rapidly increasing in number, complexity, enforcement, fines, and penalties. Data privacy, data security and AI laws and their interpretations continue to develop and are inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. \nAs we continue to expand the reach of our brand into additional markets, we will be increasingly subject to additional laws, regulations, and rules. \nFor additional information regarding these and other laws, regulations, and rules that affect us and our business, see Note 13, \nCommitments and Contingencies – Legal and Regulatory Matters – Regulatory Matters, \nto our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeasonality\nOur business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In a typical year, the first, second, and third quarters have higher Nights and Experiences Booked than the fourth quarter, as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter for North America and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). \nOur key business metrics, including Gross Booking Value (“GBV”) and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”), can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events. We experience seasonality in our GBV that is generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter. A significant portion of our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary inline with booking volume. We historically achieve our highest quarterly GBV in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees typically make our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees, a lower sequential decrease in Free Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash Flow is typically lower. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for definitions of our key business metrics. \nCompetition \nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. As we seek to expand our community globally, we face competition in attracting hosts and guests. \nCompetition for Hosts\n \nWe compete to attract and retain hosts to and on our platform to list their homes and experiences, as hosts have a range of options for doing so. We compete for hosts based on many factors including the volume of bookings generated by guests, ease of use of our platform, the service fees we charge, host protections, such as those included in AirCover for Hosts, our brand, and community support. \n6\nTable of Contents\nCompetition for Guests \nWe compete to attract and retain guests to and on our platform, as guests have a range of options to find and book accommodations and experiences. We compete for guests based on many factors, including unique inventory and availability of listings, the value and all-in cost of host offerings on our platform relative to other options, our brand, ease of use of our platform, the trust and safety of our platform, and community support. \nOur competitors include: \n•\nonline travel agencies (“OTAs”), such as Booking Holdings (including the brand Booking.com), Expedia Group (including the brand Expedia), Trip.com Group and other regional OTAs; \n•\ninternet search engines, such as Google and those powered by AI, including its travel search products;\n•\nhotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton, Accor, Wyndham, as well as boutique hotel chains and independent hotels;\n•\nproperty management companies; and\n•\nonline platforms offering experiences.\nOur Intellectual Property \nOur intellectual property is an important component of our business. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, social media handles, know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other intellectual property and contractual rights. \nWe have a substantial patent portfolio, consisting of issued patents and pending patent applications (“patent assets”) from the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. The portfolio includes both organically grown and acquired patent assets. We own a trademark portfolio with protections around the world for our primary brands — AIRBNB and our Bélo logo, for other brands or protectable brand elements important to our business, including but not limited to Rausch, our primary corporate color, localizations, translations, and transliterations of our primary brands, and brands associated with businesses we have acquired. We have registered domain names that we use in or relate to our business, such as the airbnb.com domain name and country code top level domain name equivalents. \nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.airbnb.com.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Except as otherwise noted, all references to 2024 refer to the year ended December 31, 2024, references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023, and references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on February 16, 2024.\nGlossary of Terms\n \nActive booker\nAn active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or experience in a given period.\nActive listing\nWe consider a listing of a home or an experience to be an active listing if it is viewable on Airbnb and has been previously booked at least once on Airbnb (excluding HotelTonight).\nAvailable listings\nAvailable listings are accommodations and experiences that are viewable on a certain date on our platform (excluding HotelTonight).\nCheck-ins\nCheck-ins represent individual stays or experiences that occur during a period that have not been canceled.\nCo-hosts\nCo-hosts are experienced hosts who provide personalized support based on the hosts’ needs, from listing setup to managing bookings and communicating with guests.\nGuest arrivals\nGuest arrivals represent an individual and all co-travelers included on a reservation for a stay for completed check-ins during a given period.\nHosts\nWe count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of users with available listings as of a certain date.\nPayments to customers \nWe make payments to customers as part of our referral programs and marketing promotions, and refund activities. The payments are generally in the form of coupon credits to be applied toward future bookings or as cash refunds.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOverview \nWe are a community based on connection and belonging—a community that was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 2 billion guest arrivals in almost every country and region across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way. \nWe have five stakeholders and we have designed our Company with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive. \n2024 Financial Highlights\nIn 2024, revenue increased by 12% to $11.1 billion compared to 2023, primarily due to a 10% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked of 43.3 million combined with higher Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) driving a 12% increase in Gross Booking Value of $8.5 billion. The growth in GBV and revenue demonstrated continued strong travel demand. \nIn 2024, net income decreased by 45% to $2.6 billion, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the release of the majority of our valuation allowance on U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion in 2023, and the recognition of deferred tax expense related to the utilization of some of those assets in 2024 (see Note 14, \nIncome Taxes,\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). This was partially offset due to a decrease in withholding taxes, associated fees, and penalties and interest expense due to a withholding tax settlement related to Italy of $770 million, $196 million and $64 million respectively. \nAdjusted EBITDA\n1\n increased 11% to $4.0 billion in 2024 demonstrating the continued strength of our business, growth in revenue and discipline in managing our cost structure. \nOur net cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion in 2024, compared to $3.9 billion, in the prior year. We generated Free Cash Flow\n1 \nof $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $3.8 billion, in the prior year.\nDuring 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 24.5 million shares of Class A common stock for $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we completed the repurchases under the August 2, 2022 share repurchase program and had $3.3 billion available for repurchase of Class A common stock under the May 9, 2023 share repurchase program. \nTrends\nInflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the United States and the global economy, such as tariffs, foreign currency fluctuations, as well as wars and other geopolitical conflicts, have contributed to an increasingly complex business environment. As a result, our future operational results may be subject to volatility. Additionally, health-related events, political instability, acts of terrorism, and natural disasters, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future.\nKey Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe track the following key business metrics and financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) (“non-GAAP financial measures”) to evaluate our operating performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. \nThese key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP is provided under the subsection titled “— Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation” and “— Free Cash Flow Reconciliation” below. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. \nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies that may calculate similarly titled metrics in a different way.\n1\n A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures is provided under the subsection titled “Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures— Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation” and “— Free Cash Flow Reconciliation” below.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our key business metrics, for each period presented below (in millions, except percentages):\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nNights and Experiences Booked\n448 \n492 \n10 \n%\nGross Booking Value\n$\n73,252 \n$\n81,784 \n12 \n%\nNights and Experiences Booked \nNights and Experiences Booked is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking was canceled on May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with one or more bedrooms. Nights and Experiences Booked grows as we attract new customers to our platform and as repeat guests increase their activity on our platform. A seat is booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights. We believe Nights and Experiences Booked is a key business metric to help investors and others understand and evaluate our results of operations in the same manner as our management team, as it represents a single unit of transaction on our platform. \n \nThe increase in our Nights and Experiences Booked was driven by strong growth across all regions.\nGross Booking Value \nGBV represents the dollar value of bookings on our platform in a period and is inclusive of host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees, and taxes, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred during that period. The timing of recording GBV and any related cancellations is similar to that described in the subsection titled “— Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures — Nights and Experiences Booked” above. Revenue from the booking is recognized upon check-in; accordingly, GBV is a leading indicator of revenue. The entire amount of a booking is reflected in GBV during the quarter in which booking occurs, whether the guest pays the entire amount of the booking upfront or elects to use our Pay Less Upfront program. Growth in GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers and reflects growth in Nights and Experiences Booked.\nThe increase in our GBV was primarily due to an increase in Nights and Experiences Booked, combined with a modest increase in ADR. Similar to Nights and Experiences Booked, our GBV improvement was driven by growth in bookings in all regions. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin, which are described below. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP is provided below. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and are not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and net income margin as well as our other U.S. GAAP results. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided by operating activities margin. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin do not reflect our ability to meet future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n36\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Measure\nDefinition\nPurpose of Non-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA &\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA\n: Net income adjusted for:\n•\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes;\n•\nother income (expense), net;\n•\ninterest income;\n•\ndepreciation and amortization;\n•\nstock-based compensation expense;\n•\nacquisition-related impacts consisting of gains (losses) recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements, and\n•\nlodging taxes for which we may have joint and several liability with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, withholding taxes on payments made to hosts and any related settlements, and transactional taxes where there is significant uncertainty as to how the taxes apply to our platform.\n \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n: Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.\n•\nEnhances comparability on a consistent basis and provides investors with useful insight into the underlying trends of the business.\n•\nUsed by management to make operating decisions such as evaluating performance, performing strategic planning, and budgeting. \nFree Cash Flow & Free Cash Flow Margin\nFree Cash Flow:\n Net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.\nFree Cash Flow Margin\n: Free Cash Flow divided by revenue.\n•\nIndicator of liquidity that provides information to our management and investors about the amount of cash generated from operations, after purchases of property and equipment, that can be used for strategic initiatives.\nThe following table summarizes our non-GAAP financial measures, along with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for each period presented below (in millions, except percentages):\n2023\n2024\nNet income \n$\n4,792 \n$\n2,648 \nNet income margin\n48 \n%\n24 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n3,653 \n$\n4,041 \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n37 \n%\n36 \n%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,884 \n$\n4,518 \nNet cash provided by operating activities margin\n39 \n%\n41 \n%\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n3,837 \n$\n4,484 \nFree Cash Flow Margin\n39 \n%\n40 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA (in millions, except percentages): \n2023\n2024\nRevenue\n$\n9,917 \n$\n11,102 \nNet income \n$\n4,792 \n$\n2,648 \nAdjusted to exclude the following:\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n(2,690)\n683 \nOther expense, net\n137 \n40 \nInterest income\n(721)\n(818)\nDepreciation and amortization\n44 \n65 \nStock-based compensation expense\n1,120 \n1,407 \nAcquisition-related impacts\n(3)\n(7)\nLodging taxes, host withholding taxes, and transactional taxes, net\n974 \n23 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n3,653 \n$\n4,041 \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n37 \n%\n36 \n%\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because they are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations, and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. \nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by growth in revenue which was driven by the increase in the number of check-ins relating to Nights and Experiences Booked and a modest increase in ADR.\nDuring 2023, we released $2.9 billion of our valuation allowance related to our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets (see Note 14, \nIncome Taxes,\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details).\n \nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation \nThe following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow (in millions, except percentages):\n \n2023\n2024\nRevenue\n$\n9,917 \n$\n11,102 \n \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,884 \n$\n4,518 \nPurchases of property and equipment\n(47)\n(34)\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n3,837 \n$\n4,484 \nFree Cash Flow Margin\n39 \n%\n40 \n%\nOur Free Cash Flow is impacted by the timing of GBV because we collect our service fees at the time of booking, which is generally before a stay or experience occurs.

For stays, service fees, which are charged to customers as a percentage of the value of the booking, excluding taxes, vary based on factors specific to the booking, such as booking value, the duration of the booking, geography, and host type. For experiences, we only earn a host fee. Substantially all of our revenue comes from stays booked on our platform. Incentives include our referral programs and marketing promotions to encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers. We experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue, which occurs upon check-in. We record the service fees that we collect from customers prior to check-in on our balance sheet as unearned fees. Revenue is net of incentives and refunds provided to customers. \n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nRevenue\n$\n9,917 \n$\n11,102 \n12 \n%\nRevenue increased $1.2 billion, or 12%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in the number of check-ins relating to Nights and Experiences Booked and a modest increase in ADR driven by our North America and EMEA regions.\nCost of Revenue \nCost of revenue includes payment processing costs, including merchant fees and chargebacks, costs associated with third-party data centers used to host our platform, and amortization of internally developed software and acquired technology. Because we act as the merchant of record, we incur all payment processing costs associated with our bookings, and we have chargebacks, which arise from account takeovers and other fraudulent activities. Cost of revenue may vary as a percentage of revenue from year to year based on activity \n39\nTable of Contents\non our platform and may also vary from quarter to quarter as a percentage of revenue based on the seasonality of our business and the difference in the timing of when bookings are made and when we recognize revenue.\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nCost of revenue\n$\n1,703 \n$\n1,878 \n10 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n17 \n%\n16 \n%\nCost of revenue increased $175 million, or 10%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in merchant fees of $173 million, due to an increase in GBV, the impact of certain one-time incentives in 2023, and an increase in cloud computing costs of $26 million, due to increased server and data storage usage. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in chargebacks of $34 million.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses and third-party service provider fees associated with community support provided via phone, email, and chat to customers; customer relations costs, which include refunds and credits related to customer satisfaction and expenses associated with our host protection programs; and allocated costs for facilities and information technology.\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nOperations and support\n$\n1,186 \n$\n1,282 \n8 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n12 \n%\n12 \n%\nOperations and support expense increased $96 million, or 8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $38 million increase in payroll-related expenses, an increase in customer relations costs of $25 million, mainly due to higher nights booked, and an increase in insurance costs of $25 million, due to higher premiums as a result of higher nights booked. \nProduct Development \nProduct development expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses and third-party service provider fees incurred in connection with the development of our platform, and allocated costs for facilities and information technology.\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nProduct development\n$\n1,722 \n$\n2,056 \n19 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n17 \n%\n19 \n%\nProduct development expense increased $334 million, or 19%, in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to a $288 million increase in payroll-related expenses.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense primarily consists of brand and performance marketing, personnel-related expenses, including those related to our field operations, policy and communications, portions of referral incentives and coupons, and allocated costs for facilities and information technology.\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nBrand and performance marketing\n$\n1,208 \n$\n1,455 \n20 \n%\nField operations and policy\n555 \n693 \n25 \n%\nTotal sales and marketing\n$\n1,763 \n$\n2,148 \n22 \n%\nPercentage of revenue\n18 \n%\n19 \n%\nSales and marketing expense increased $385 million, or 22%, in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to a $294 million increase in marketing activities associated with ongoing marketing campaigns and search engine marketing, a $58 million increase in payroll-related expenses, and a $26 million increase in consultant and other service provider costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses for management and administrative functions, including finance and accounting, legal, and human resources. General and administrative expense also includes certain professional services fees, general corporate and director and officer insurance, allocated costs for facilities and information technology, indirect taxes, \n40\nTable of Contents\nincluding lodging tax reserves for which we may be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, and bad debt expense.\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n2,025 \n$\n1,185 \n(41)\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n20 \n%\n11 \n%\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $840 million, or 41%, in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to decreased non-income taxes and related fees and penalties, partially offset by an increase in payroll-related expenses. Non-income taxes and related fees and penalties decreased $656 million and $194 million, respectively, primarily due to a withholding tax settlement related to Italy, partially off-set by an increase in payroll-related expenses of $22 million.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts held on behalf of customers.\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nInterest income\n$\n721 \n$\n818 \n13 \n%\nInterest income increased $97 million, or 13%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher cash and investment balances.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and balances, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, the change in fair value of investments and financial instruments, including our share of income or loss from our equity method investments, and interest expense, which consists primarily of interest associated with various indirect tax reserves, amortization of debt issuance and debt discount costs. \n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nOther expense, net\n$\n(137)\n$\n(40)\n71 \n%\nThe change in other expense, net of $177 million in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to increased foreign exchange gains of $77 million and a decrease in interest expense of $58 million related to interest on withholding taxes recorded in 2023, partially offset by an impairment charge of $45 million on an investment in a privately-held company in 2024.\nProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. We expect our effective tax rate in the future to depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, U.S. tax on foreign income net of allowable credits, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credits, tax effects from capital losses not expected to be utilized, restructurings, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2023\n2024\n% Change\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n$\n(2,690)\n$\n683 \n125 \n%\nEffective tax rate\n(128)\n%\n21 \n%\nThe provision for income taxes during 2024 was driven by current tax on U.S. and foreign earnings and deferred tax expense resulting from prior year’s valuation allowance release on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and the utilization of some of those assets in 2024. The income tax benefit for 2023, was primarily due to the release of $2.9 billion of our valuation allowance related to certain of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as a discrete tax benefit.\nIn 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed on a two-pillar solution to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation, known to as Pillar One and a 15% global minimum effective tax rate, known as Pillar Two. In December of 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD’s global minimum tax rate of 15%. The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules. The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. We considered the applicable tax law changes on Pillar Two implementation in the relevant countries, and concluded there was no material impact to our tax provision for 2024. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these tax law changes on future reporting periods.\n41\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $10.6 billion. As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.9 billion, which included $2.6 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents consist of checking and interest-bearing accounts and highly-liquid securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2024, short-term investments totaled $3.7 billion. Short-term investments primarily consist of highly-liquid investment grade corporate debt securities, time deposits, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government and government agency debt securities (“government bonds”), and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. These amounts do not include funds of $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, that we held for bookings in advance of guests completing check-ins that we record separately on our consolidated balance sheet in funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a corresponding liability in funds payable and amounts payable to customers. \nOur cash and cash equivalents are generally held at large global systemically important banks (or G-SIBs), which are subject to high capital requirements and are required to regularly perform stringent stress tests related to their ability to absorb capital losses. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held outside of the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. However, repatriation of such funds may result in additional tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances in the United States are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. \nWe have access to $1.0 billion of commitments and a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit under the 2022 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the 2022 Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled $19 million. See Note 10, \nDebt\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the 2022 Credit Facility.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of our 0% convertible senior notes due on March 15, 2026. On March 3, 2021, in connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain of the initial purchasers and other financial institutions (the \"option counterparties\") at a cost of approximately $100 million. The cap price of the Capped Calls was $360.80 per share of Class A common stock, which represented a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock of $180.40 per share on March 3, 2021, subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our total minimum lease payments were $299 million, of which $83 million is due in the succeeding 12 months. We have a commercial agreement with a data hosting services provider to spend or incur an aggregate of at least $672 million for vendor services through 2027. See Note 9, \nLeases\n, Note 10, \nDebt\n, and Note 13, \nCommitments and Contingencies,\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these commitments.\nDuring 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 24.5 million shares of Class A common stock for $3.4 billion through two share repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $3.3 billion available to repurchase shares of Class A common stock under our share repurchase program.\nCash Flows \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in millions): \n \n2023\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,884 \n$\n4,518 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(1,042)\n(616)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(2,430)\n(3,572)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n152 \n(237)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities \nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was $4.5 billion, which was primarily due to income from operations of $2.6 billion and interest income of $818 million, adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 billion. \nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities \nNet cash used in investing activities in 2024 was $616 million, which was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds resulting from sales and maturities of short-term investments.\n42\nTable of Contents\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities \nNet cash used in financing activities in 2024 was $3.6 billion, primarily due to share repurchases of $3.4 billion, and an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $630 million, partially offset by the increase in funds payable and amounts payable to customers of $320 million.\nEffect of Exchange Rates \nDuring 2024, we recorded a reduction of $237 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our hosts and guests. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of customers, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries.\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our short and long-term cash requirements. As such, we believe that the cash flows generated from operating activities will meet our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term. In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash requirements will include share repurchases, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, debt repayments, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, and ability to attract and retain customers on our platform. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows and cash on hand. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item IA of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the market risks identified in the section titled \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndemnification Agreements \nIn the ordinary course of business, we include limited indemnification provisions under certain agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations of varying scope and terms. See Note 13, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K further information regarding our indemnification agreements. \nCritical Accounting Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. \nWe base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nLodging Tax Obligations and Other Non-Income Tax Matters\nIn jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with hosts. Airbnb is also subject to other non-income taxes primarily arising from transactions with our customers such as transactional taxes (sales, value-added, business, digital service, and similar taxes) where there may be significant uncertainty as to how the taxes apply to our platform, as well as uncertainty on the applicability of withholding taxes on certain payments made to hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to federal, state, city, and local taxes related to lodging and other non-income taxes where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held liable, or, in the case of lodging taxes, jointly and severally liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Changes to these liabilities are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nEvaluating potential outcomes for lodging and other non-income taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions, and estimates in determining our liability reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes, which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging or other non-income and related taxes on either historic or future transactions; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging and other non-income taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established. See Note 13, \n43\nTable of Contents\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \nIncome Taxes \nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and evaluating the impact of tax law changes, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. \nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets across our operating jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income (loss) before provision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets are realizable, except for California research and development credits, capital loss carryovers, and certain losses subject to dual consolidated loss rules. We maintain a valuation allowance for California research and development credits due to uncertainty about their realizability, as they have not met the “more likely than not” criteria. Changes in valuation allowance during interim periods are reflected in the annual effective tax rate, with any releases based on future taxable income recorded as discrete tax benefits. In 2023, we released $2.9 billion of our valuation allowance and will continue to review the need for such allowances quarterly.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
