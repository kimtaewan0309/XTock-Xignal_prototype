  "item1": "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS.\n​\nThe Kroger Co. (the “Company” or “Kroger”) was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. Our Company is built on the foundation of our retail grocery business, which includes the added convenience of our retail pharmacies and fuel centers. Our strategy is focused on growing households and increasing customer loyalty by delivering great value and convenience, and investing in four strategic pillars: Fresh, \nOur Brands\n, Data & Personalization and Seamless. \n​\nWe utilize the data and traffic generated by our retail business to create personalized experiences and value for our customers. This data and traffic also enables our fast-growing, high operating margin alternative profit business, including data and analytic services and third-party media revenue. In turn, the value generated from these businesses enables us to reinvest back into our retail business. \n​\nOur revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. All references to 2024, 2023 and 2022 are to the fiscal years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, unless specifically indicated otherwise.\n​\nWe maintain a web site (www.thekrogerco.com) that includes additional information about the Company. Kroger’s website and any reports or other information made available by Kroger through its website are not part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available through our web site, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our interactive data files, including amendments. These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with, or furnished them electronically to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and are also available at www.sec.gov.\n​\nKroger is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. Our combination of assets includes the following:\n​\nStores\n​\nAs of February 1, 2025, Kroger operates supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the District of Columbia. As of February 1, 2025, Kroger operated, either directly or through its subsidiaries, 2,731 supermarkets, of which 2,273 had pharmacies and 1,702 had fuel centers. Approximately 51% of our supermarkets were operated in Company-owned facilities, including some Company-owned buildings on leased land. Our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition. We connect with customers through our expanding seamless ecosystem and the consistent delivery of a full, fresh, and friendly customer experience. \nFuel sales are an important part of our revenue, net earnings and loyalty offering. \nOur fuel strategy is to include a fuel center at each of our supermarket locations when it is feasible and it is expected to be profitable. \nEach fuel center typically includes five to ten islands of fuel dispensers and storage tanks with capacity for 40,000 to 50,000 gallons of fuel. \nSupermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats: combination food and drug stores (“combo stores”); multi-department stores; marketplace stores; or price impact warehouses.\n​\n3\n\n\nThe combo store is the primary grocery store format. We believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments, including natural food and organic sections, pharmacies, general merchandise, pet centers and high-quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce.\n​\nMulti-department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores. In addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store, multi-department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel, home fashion and furnishings, outdoor living, electronics, automotive products and toys.\n​\nMarketplace stores are smaller in size than multi-department stores. They offer full-service grocery, pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel, home goods and toys.\n​\nPrice impact warehouse stores offer a “no-frills, low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items. Quality meat, dairy, baked goods and fresh produce items provide strategic differentiation for price impact warehouse stores. The average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store.\n​\nSeamless Digital Ecosystem\n​\nWe offer a convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop with us, including Pickup, Delivery and Ship. We offer Pickup and Harris Teeter ExpressLane™ — personalized, order online, pick up at the store services — at 2,412 of our supermarkets and provide Delivery, which allows us to offer digital solutions to substantially all of our customers. Our Delivery solutions include orders delivered to customers from retail store locations, customer fulfillment centers and orders placed through third-party platforms. These channels allow us to serve customers anything, anytime and anywhere with zero compromise on selection, convenience, and price. We also provide relevant customer-facing apps and interfaces that have the features customers want that are also reliable, easy to use and deliver a seamless customer experience across our store and digital channels.\n​\nMerchandising and Manufacturing\n​\nOur Brands \nproducts play an important role in our merchandising strategy and represented over $32 billion of our sales in 2024. Our supermarkets, on average, stock over 12,000 private label items. \nOur Brands \nproducts are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers.” Private Selection® is our main premium quality brand, offering customers culinary foods and ingredients that deliver amazing eating experiences. The Kroger® brand, which represents the majority of our private label items, is designed to consistently satisfy and delight customers with quality products that exceed or meet the national brand in taste and efficacy, as well as with unique and differentiated products. Big K®, Smart Way® and Heritage Farm® are some of our value brands, designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price. In addition to our three “tiers,” \nOur Brands\n offers customers a variety of natural and organic products with Simple Truth® and Simple Truth Organic®. Both Simple Truth® and Simple Truth Organic® are free from a defined list of artificial ingredients that some customers have told us they do not want in their food, and the Simple Truth Organic products are USDA certified organic.\n​\nApproximately 31% of \nOur Brands\n units sold in our supermarkets are produced in our food production plants; the remaining \nOur Brands\n items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers. We perform a “make or buy” analysis on \nOur Brands\n products and decisions are based upon a comparison of market-based transfer prices versus open market purchases. As of February 1, 2025, we owned 33 food production plants. These plants consisted of 14 dairies, nine deli or bakery plants, five grocery product plants, two beverage plants, one meat plant and two cheese plants.\n​\n4\n\n\nOur Data\n​\nThe traffic and data generated by our retail business, including pharmacies and fuel centers, enables our diverse business. Kroger serves approximately 63 million households annually and because of our rewards program, over 95% of customer transactions are tethered to a Kroger loyalty card. Our over 20 years of investment in data science capabilities allows us to utilize this data to create personalized experiences and value for our customers and enables our growing, high operating margin alternative profit businesses, including data analytic services and third-party media revenue. Our retail media business – Kroger Precision Marketing – provides differentiated media capabilities for our consumer packaged goods partners and other industry verticals. It is a key driver of our digital profitability and alternative profit.\n​\nSEASONALITY\n​\nThe majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature. However, revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year. Additionally, certain significant events including inclement weather systems, particularly winter storms, tend to affect our sales trends.\n​\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n​\nOur People \n​\nWe want Kroger to be a place where our customers love to shop and associates love to work. This is why we aim to create working environments where associates feel encouraged and supported to be their best selves every day. As of February 1, 2025, Kroger employed over 409,000 full- and part-time employees. Our people are essential to our success, and we focus intentionally on attracting, developing and engaging a diverse workforce that represents the communities we serve. We strive to create a culture of opportunity and take seriously our role as a leading employer in the United States. Kroger has provided a large number of people with first jobs, new beginnings and lifelong careers. We have long been guided by our values – Honesty, Integrity, Respect, Safety, Diversity and Inclusion.\n​\nAttracting & Developing Our Talent\n​\nTo deliver on our customers’ experiences and remain competitive with union and non-union employers, we continually try to improve how we attract and retain talent. In addition to competitive wages, quality benefits and a safe work environment, we offer a broad range of employment opportunities for workers of all ages and aspirations. Many retail roles offer opportunities to learn new skills, where new associates come for a job, and discover a career.\n​\nAssociates at all levels of Kroger have access to training and education programs to build their skills and prepare for the roles they want. In 2024, we spent approximately $192 million on training our associates through onboarding, leadership development programs and programs designed to upskill associates across the Company. We continue to invest in new platforms and applications to make learning more accessible to our associates. \n​\nBeyond our own training programs, associates can take advantage of our tuition reimbursement benefit, which offers up to $3,500 annually — $21,000 over the course of employment — toward continuing education. These funds can be applied to education programs like certifications, associate or graduate degrees. Approximately 5,500 associates, 89% of whom are hourly, have taken advantage of our tuition reimbursement program in 2024. Kroger has invested approximately $64 million in this program since it launched in 2018.\n​\n5\n\n\nRewarding Our Associates\n​\nAs we continue to operate in a challenging labor market, we are dedicated to attracting and retaining the right talent across the organization to be able to continue delivering for our customers. We are investing in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education, training and development and health and wellness. During 2024, we increased associate wages resulting in an average hourly rate of more than $19, and a rate of more than $25 with comprehensive benefits factored in, which is a 38% increase in rate in the last seven years. Over the last five years, we have now invested more than $2.7 billion in incremental wage investments. We remain committed to supporting our associates with investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that are sustainable and will allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities we serve. We expect to make continued associate investments in 2025. \n​\nCreating a Safe Environment\n​\nOur associates’ safety is a top priority. It is also one of our core values. We prioritize providing the right safety training and equipment, safe working conditions and resources to maintain and improve associates’ well-being. Through our strategy to set clear expectations, routine monitoring, and regular communication and engagement, we reduce the number of injuries and accidents that happen in our workplace. We track health and safety metrics centrally for an enterprise-wide view of issues, trends and opportunities and monitor associate injury performance including total injuries, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) injury rates, and lost-time injuries, as well as customer injury metrics like slip-and-fall injuries. We also track the completion of required training for associates, and we regularly share these metrics with leaders and relevant team members to inform management decisions.\n​\nSupporting Labor Relations\n​\nA majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions. There are approximately 350 such agreements, usually with terms of three to five years. Wages, health care and pensions are included in all of these collective bargaining agreements that cover approximately 64% of our associates. Our objective is to negotiate contracts that balance wage increases that are competitive with union and non-union employers and provide affordable healthcare for associates with keeping groceries affordable for the communities we serve. Our obligation is to do this in a way that maintains a financially sustainable business.\n​\nCLIMATE RESILIENCIES\n​\nManaging greenhouse gas emissions to reduce our impact on the environment is an important part of Thriving Together, our responsible business strategy, and has been a focus for our business for many years. With a large portfolio of supermarkets, distribution warehouses, and food production plants, as well as a complex supply chain, we continue to take steps to reduce both the effects of our operations on the environment and the potential effects of a changing climate on our operations. \n​\nTo help identify and manage climate-related risks to our business, we conducted a quantitative climate risk assessment to determine the likelihood that different physical climate risks, including drought, extreme heat and extreme precipitation, would affect our operations at representative facilities in different geographies and, in turn, potentially increase operating costs for these facilities. As a result of our risk assessments, we do not currently anticipate the modeled physical risks to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the foreseeable future. We plan to update these climate risk assessments moving forward as needed.\n​\nWe also acknowledge that climate-related legislation could affect our business. As a result of current state and federal requirements regarding the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbon (“HFC”) refrigerants, we anticipate steadily replacing our refrigerant infrastructure to reach required levels, which could incur significant costs to the business. Any such legislation will affect all retailers using refrigerants in their operations. We also monitor utility and technology availability and costs to help anticipate how these could affect our business operations in the future.\n​\n6\n\n\nTo help prepare for and manage a variety of risk scenarios, including natural disasters and business disruptions to our supply chain, we maintain more than 200 business continuity plans. We have installed technologies and processes to ensure our supermarkets, food production plants, fulfillment centers and supply chain can respond quickly and remain operational to serve our customers.\n​\nThis topic is managed by leadership with input from several departments across the business. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our responsibilities as a responsible business and our practices related to environmental sustainability, including potential climate effects, along with other environmental and social topics of material importance.\n​\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n​\nThe following is a list of the names and ages of the executive officers and the positions held by each such person as of March 21, 2025.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n​\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of The Kroger Co. should be read in conjunction with the “Forward-looking Statements” section set forth in Part I and the “Risk Factors” section set forth in Item 1A of Part I. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report, as well as Part II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024, which provides additional information on comparisons of fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n​\nOUR VALUE CREATION MODEL – DELIVERING CONSISTENT AND ATTRACTIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN\n​\nKroger’s proven value creation model is allowing us to deliver today and invest for the future. The foundation of our value creation model is our omnichannel retail business, including fuel and health and wellness. By executing on our go-to-market strategy built on the four pillars of Fresh, \nOur Brands\n, Personalization and Seamless, we are creating a shopping experience that builds loyalty and grows sales. Our retail business generates traffic and data which accelerates growth in our high operating margin alternative profit businesses, like Kroger Precision Marketing. In turn, the value generated from these businesses enables us to reinvest back into our retail business.  \n​\nWe are focused on enhancing our pillars and delivering an exceptional customer experience to accelerate this flywheel effect. By expanding our store network and improving our digital capabilities, we expect to grow households and increase sales. Our model provides more ways than ever to generate net earnings growth. \n​\nThis will be achieved by:\n​\n●\nGrowing identical sales without fuel. Our plan involves maximizing growth opportunities in our retail business and is supported by continued strategic investments in our associates, greater value for our customers and our seamless ecosystem to ensure we deliver a full, fresh and friendly experience for every customer, every time. In an effort to serve more households, we will invest in major storing projects that allow us to increase both in-store and online sales. As more and more customers incorporate ecommerce into their permanent routines, we expect digital sales to grow at a double-digit rate – a faster pace than other food at home sales – over time; and\n​\n●\nExpanding operating margin through long-term initiatives in gross margin, growing alternative profit businesses, and productivity and cost savings initiatives that are focused on simplifying processes and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without affecting the customer experience. Together, these will enable us to improve operating margin, while balancing strategic price investments for customers and wage and benefit investments for associates.\n​\nWe expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and are committed to being disciplined with capital deployment in support of our value creation model and stated capital allocation priorities. Our first priority is to invest in the business through attractive high return opportunities that drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth. We are committed to maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.30 to 2.50. We also expect to continue to grow our dividend over time and return excess cash to shareholders via stock repurchases, subject to Board approval. During the fourth quarter of 2024, following the termination of the merger with Albertsons, as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we resumed our share repurchase program after a more than two-year pause to return excess capital to our shareholders.\n​\nWe expect our value creation model will result in total shareholder return within our target range of 8% to 11% over time.\n​\n24\n\n\n2024 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n​\nWe achieved solid results in 2024 led by our pharmacy and digital performance, which demonstrates the strength and diversity of our value creation model. We helped customers save in multiple ways through fresh affordable products and promotions including loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and \nOur Brands\n products. By delivering a differentiated customer experience through our focus areas of Fresh, \nOur Brands\n, Personalization and Seamless, our go-to-market strategy positioned us well to meet our customers’ needs, growing households and enhancing loyalty, growing sales and generating traffic, which in turn accelerated growth opportunities in our alternative profit businesses and drove greater efficiency.\n​\nWe will continue to improve our customer experience and increase our investments in major storing projects to drive traffic and increase volumes because they power our value creation model and are critical to our long-term success. We also remain focused on associate retention by investing in our associates, through enhanced wages and benefits and improved training and career development opportunities. In 2024, we increased associate wages resulting in an average hourly rate of more than $19, and a rate of more than $25 with comprehensive benefits factored in, which is a 38% increase in rate in the last seven years. This positions us well to generate attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders.\n​\n25\n\n\nThe following table provides highlights of our financial performance:\n​\nFinancial Performance Data\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFebruary 1,\n   \nPercentage\n   \nFebruary 3,\n​\n​\n​\n2025\n​\nChange\n​\n2024\n​\nSales\n(1)\n​\n$\n 147,123\n​\n (1.9)\n%  \n$\n 150,039\n​\nSales without fuel and the Extra Week\n(1)\n​\n$\n 132,150\n​\n 0.9\n%  \n$\n 130,988\n​\nIdentical sales excluding fuel\n​\n​\n 1.5\n%  \nN/A\n​\n​\n 0.9\n%\nFIFO gross margin rate, excluding rent, depreciation and amortization, fuel and the Extra Week, bps increase\n(1)\n​\n​\n 0.32\n​\nN/A\n​\n​\n 0.18\n​\nOG&A rate, excluding fuel, Adjusted Items and the Extra Week, bps increase\n(1)\n​\n​\n 0.31\n​\nN/A\n​\n​\n 0.21\n​\nOperating profit\n(1)\n​\n$\n 3,849\n​\n 24.3\n%  \n$\n 3,096\n​\nAdjusted FIFO operating profit excluding the Extra Week\n(1)\n​\n$\n 4,674\n​\n (2.6)\n%  \n$\n 4,799\n​\nNet earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. \n​\n$\n 2,665\n​\n 23.2\n%  \n$\n 2,164\n​\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. excluding the Extra Week\n​\n$\n 3,246\n​\n (2.7)\n%  \n$\n 3,335\n​\nNet earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share\n​\n$\n 3.67\n​\n 24.0\n%  \n$\n 2.96\n​\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share excluding the Extra Week\n​\n$\n 4.47\n​\n (2.0)\n%  \n$\n 4.56\n​\nDividends paid\n​\n$\n 883\n​\n 10.9\n%  \n$\n 796\n​\nDividends paid per common share\n​\n$\n 1.22\n​\n 10.9\n%  \n$\n 1.10\n​\nShare repurchases\n(2)\n​\n$\n 4,194\n​\nN/A\n​\n$\n 62\n​\nIncrease (decrease) in total debt, including obligations under finance leases compared to prior fiscal year end\n(3)\n​\n$\n 5,679\n​\nN/A\n​\n$\n (1,152)\n​\n(1)\nTotal sales in 2024 includes $2,021 of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy sales. Total sales in 2023 includes $3,193 of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy sales. In 2024, the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy had a positive effect on the FIFO gross margin rate, excluding rent, depreciation and amortization, fuel and the Extra Week and a negative effect on the OG&A rate, excluding fuel, the Extra Week and the 2024 and 2023 Adjusted Items, as defined below. It had no material effect on operating profit. \n(2)\nThe $4,194 share repurchases included 68.4 million Kroger common shares, at an average price of $61.31 per share, which includes excise tax related to the shares repurchased. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(3)\nThe increase of $5,679 in total debt was primarily due to issuing $10,500 of senior notes to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the proposed merger with Albertsons and for general corporate purposes offset by the mandatory redemption of $4,700 of senior notes following the termination of the merger. After the termination of the proposed merger, these funds were primarily used to fund the $5,000 ASR program to be completed under our December 2024 Repurchase Program. For additional information about the senior notes and ASR program, see Note 5, Note 13 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\n26\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n \n​\nNotable items for 2024 are: \n​\nShareholder Return\n​\n●\nAchieved net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share of $3.67, which represents a 24% increase compared to 2023.\n​\n●\nAchieved adjusted net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share of $4.47, which represents a 2% decrease compared to 2023, excluding the 53\nrd\n week in 2023 (the “Extra Week”).\n​\n●\nAchieved operating profit of $3.8 billion, which represents a 24% increase compared to 2023.\n​\n●\nAchieved adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.7 billion, which represents a 3% decrease compared to 2023, excluding the Extra Week. \n​\n●\nGenerated cash flows from operations of $5.8 billion, which represents a 15% decrease compared to 2023.\n​\n●\nReturned $5.1 billion to shareholders from share repurchases and dividend payments, which included the total cost of the initial delivery of approximately 65.6 million shares repurchased as part of the $5.0 billion ASR program. \n​\nOther Financial Results\n​\n●\nIdentical sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.5% in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in total and loyal households shopping with us, increased Health and Wellness sales and digital sales, partially offset by a reduction in the number of items in basket.\n​\n●\nDigital sales grew to more than $13.0 billion in annual sales. Digital sales include products ordered online and picked up at our stores and our Delivery and Ship solutions. Our Delivery solutions include orders delivered to customers from retail store locations, customer fulfillment centers and orders placed through third-party platforms. Our Ship solutions primarily include online orders placed through our owned platforms that are dispatched using mail service or third-party platforms. Digital sales growth was led by the strength of our Delivery solutions. Delivery solutions, which grew by 18% in 2024, excluding the Extra Week in 2023, were driven by the growth in demand across our Kroger Delivery network.\n​\n●\nAlternative profit streams contributed $1.35 billion of operating profit in 2024, driven by a 17% increase in third-party media revenue, excluding the Extra Week in 2023. \n​\n27\n\n\nSignificant Events\n​\n●\nOn December 19, 2024, we entered into ASR agreements with two financial institutions to reacquire, in aggregate, $5.0 billion in shares of Kroger common stock. The ASR agreements will be completed under our $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization. During 2024, we funded $5.0 billion and received a $4.0 billion initial delivery of approximately 65.6 million Kroger common shares at an average price of $61.54 per share, which includes excise taxes related to the share repurchases. The total numbers of shares purchased by us pursuant to the ASR agreements will be based on the average of the volume-weighted average prices of Kroger common shares on specified dates during the term of each ASR agreement, less a discount, and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreements. Final settlement under the ASR agreements is expected to occur no later than the third fiscal quarter of our Fiscal 2025. \n​\n●\nOn December 11, 2024, we delivered a notice (the “Termination Notice”) to Albertsons, terminating the merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) we entered into with Albertsons on October 13, 2022. The Termination Notice further notified Albertsons that a prior termination letter sent by Albertsons to us, dated December 10, 2024, is not an effective termination. In connection with the Termination Notice, we notified Albertsons that we have no obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) because Albertsons has failed to perform and comply in all material respects with its covenants under the Merger Agreement. For additional information about the termination of the Merger Agreement, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\n●\nOn October 4, 2024, we completed the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business to Elevance Health for $464 million. In 2024, we recognized a gain on sale for $79 million, $91 million net of tax, which includes the reduction to income tax expense of $31 million related to recognizing deferred tax assets for the divested entity. Kroger Specialty Pharmacy had sales of $2.0 billion in 2024 and $3.2 billion in 2023. Kroger Specialty Pharmacy was a low margin business. As a result, the sale of the business increased both our gross margin and operating, general and administrative costs as a rate of sales. It had no material effect on operating profit.\n​\n●\nOn August 20, 2024, we issued $10.5 billion of senior notes to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the proposed merger and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, we redeemed $4.7 billion of the senior notes that included a special mandatory redemption feature on December 18, 2024. For additional information about the issuance and redemption of these senior notes, see Note 5 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nOUR BUSINESS\n​\nThe Kroger Co. (the “Company” or “Kroger”) was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. Our Company is built on the foundation of our retail grocery business, which includes the added convenience of our retail pharmacies and fuel centers. Our strategy is focused on growing customer loyalty by delivering great value and convenience, and investing in four strategic pillars: Fresh, \nOur Brands\n, Data & Personalization and Seamless. \n​\nWe also utilize the data and traffic generated by our retail business to deliver incremental value and services for our customers that generate alternative profit streams. These alternative profit streams would not exist without our core retail business.  \n​\n28\n\n\nOur revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. Our retail operations, which represent 98% of our consolidated sales, is our only reportable segment.\n​\nKroger is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. Our combination of assets includes the following:\n​\nStores\n​\nAs of February 1, 2025, Kroger operates supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the District of Columbia. As of February 1, 2025, Kroger operated, either directly or through its subsidiaries, 2,731 supermarkets, of which 2,273 had pharmacies and 1,702 had fuel centers. We connect with customers through our expanding seamless ecosystem and the consistent delivery of a full, fresh, and friendly customer experience. \nFuel sales are an important part of our revenue, net earnings and loyalty offering. \nOur fuel strategy is to include a fuel center at each of our supermarket locations when it is feasible and it is expected to be profitable.\n​\nSeamless Digital Ecosystem\n​\nWe offer a convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop with us, including Pickup, Delivery and Ship. We offer Pickup and Harris Teeter ExpressLane™ — personalized, order online, pick up at the store services — at 2,412 of our supermarkets and provide Delivery, which allows us to offer digital solutions to substantially all of our customers. Our Delivery solutions include orders delivered to customers from retail store locations, customer fulfillment centers and\n \norders placed through third-party platforms. These channels allow us to serve customers anything, anytime, and anywhere with zero compromise on selection, convenience, and price. We also provide relevant customer-facing apps and interfaces that have the features customers want that are also reliable, easy to use and deliver a seamless customer experience across our store and digital channels.\n​\nMerchandising and Manufacturing\n​\nOur Brands\n products play an important role in our merchandising strategy and represented over $32 billion of our sales in 2024. We own 33 food production plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 31% of \nOur Brands\n units sold in our supermarkets; the remaining \nOur Brands\n items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers.\n​\nOur Data\n​\nThe traffic and data generated by our retail business, including pharmacies and fuel centers, is enabling this transformation. Kroger serves approximately 63 million households annually and because of our rewards program, over 95% of customer transactions are tethered to a Kroger loyalty card. Our over 20 years of investment in data science capabilities is allowing us to utilize this data to create personalized experiences and value for our customers and is also enabling our fast-growing, high operating margin alternative profit businesses, including data analytic services and third-party media revenue. Our retail media business – Kroger Precision Marketing – provides best in class media capabilities for our consumer packaged goods partners and other industry verticals. It is a key driver of our digital profitability and alternative profit.\n​\n29\n\n\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n \n​\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We provide non-GAAP measures, including First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) gross margin, FIFO operating profit, adjusted FIFO operating profit, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin, operating profit, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other GAAP measure of performance. These measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n​\nWe calculate FIFO gross margin as FIFO gross profit divided by sales. FIFO gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing and transportation expenses, but excluding the Last-In, First-Out (“LIFO”) charge, rent and depreciation and amortization. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by management, and management believes FIFO gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures the merchandising and operational effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy.\n​\nWe calculate FIFO operating profit as operating profit excluding the LIFO charge. FIFO operating profit is an important measure used by management, and management believes FIFO operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures the operational effectiveness of our financial model\n.\n​\nThe adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit metrics are important measures used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods. We believe adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons of our net earnings, net earnings per diluted share and FIFO operating profit because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. Net earnings for 2024 include the following, which we define as the “2024 Adjusted Items:”\n​\n●\nCharges to operating, general and administrative expenses (“OG&A”) of $32 million, $24 million net of tax, for severance charge and related benefits, $30 million, $23 million net of tax, for impairment of intangible assets, $25 million, $19 million net of tax, for property losses, $684 million, $489 million net of tax, for merger-related costs, net of a credit to OG&A of $27 million, $21 million net of tax, for opioid settlement charges (the “2024 OG&A Adjusted Items”).\n​\n●\nA loss in other income (expense) of $148 million, $112 million net of tax, for the unrealized loss on investments, a charge to other income (expense) of $34 million, $26 million net of tax, for merger-related net interest expense and a gain in other income (expense) of $79 million, $60 million net of tax, on the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy (the “2024 Other Income (Expense) Adjusted Items”).\n​\n●\nA reduction to income tax expense of $31 million from recognizing deferred tax assets related to the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business (the “2024 Income Tax Expense Adjusted Item”).\n​\n30\n\n\nNet earnings for 2023 include $179 million, $144 million net of tax, due to the Extra Week. In addition, net earnings for 2023 include the following, which we define as the “2023 Adjusted Items:”\n​\n●\nCharges to OG&A of $316 million, $268 million net of tax, for merger related costs and $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion net of tax, for opioid settlement charges (the “2023 OG&A Adjusted Items”).\n​\n●\nA gain in other income (expense) of $151 million, $116 million net of tax, for the unrealized gain on investments (the “2023 Other Income (Expense) Adjusted Item”).\n​\nNet earnings for 2022 include the following, which we define as the “2022 Adjusted Items:”\n​\n●\nCharges to OG&A of $25 million, $19 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension funds, $20 million, $15 million net of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef contingent consideration, $44 million, $34 million net of tax, for merger related costs, $85 million, $67 million net of tax, for opioid settlement charges and $164 million for goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges related to Vitacost.com (the “2022 OG&A Adjusted Items”).\n​\n●\nLosses in other income (expense) of $728 million, $561 million net of tax, for the unrealized loss on investments (the “2022 Other Income (Expense) Adjusted Item”).\n​\n31\n\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. to adjusted net earnings

We use these financial metrics and related computations to evaluate our operational effectiveness and our results of operations from period to period and to plan for near and long-term operating and strategic decisions. These key performance indicators should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.\n​\n33\n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n​\nSales\n​\nTotal Sales\n($ in millions)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPercentage\n​\n​\n​\n2023\n​\nPercentage\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n​\nChange\n(1)\n​\n2023\n(6)\n​\nAdjusted\n(2)(6)\n​\nChange\n(3)\n​\n2022\n(6)\nTotal sales to retail customers without fuel\n(4)\n​\n$\n 130,859\n​\n 0.8\n%  \n$\n 132,175\n​\n$\n 129,759\n​\n 0.9\n%  \n$\n 128,559\nSupermarket fuel sales\n​\n​\n 14,973\n​\n (8.4)\n%  \n \n 16,621\n​\n​\n 16,340\n​\n (12.3)\n%  \n​\n 18,632\nOther sales\n(5)\n​\n \n 1,291\n​\n 5.0\n%  \n \n 1,243\n​\n​\n 1,229\n​\n 15.2\n%  \n \n 1,067\nTotal sales\n​\n$\n 147,123\n​\n (0.1)\n%  \n$\n 150,039\n​\n$\n 147,328\n​\n (0.6)\n%  \n$\n 148,258\n(1)\nThis column represents the percentage change in 2024 compared to 2023 adjusted sales, which removes the Extra Week.\n(2)\nThe 2023 adjusted column represents the items presented in the 2023 column adjusted to remove the Extra Week.\n(3)\nThis column represents the percentage change in 2023 adjusted sales compared to 2022.\n(4)\nDigital sales are included in the “Total sales to retail customers without fuel” line above. Digital sales include products ordered online and picked up at our stores and our Delivery and Ship solutions. Our Delivery solutions include orders delivered to customers from retail store locations, customer fulfillment centers and orders placed through third-party platforms. Our Ship solutions primarily include online orders placed through our owned platforms that are dispatched using mail service or third-party courier. Digital sales increased approximately 11% in 2024 and 12% in 2023, excluding the Extra Week in 2023, and increased approximately 4% in 2022. Digital sales growth for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was led by strength in our Delivery solutions, which grew by 18% in 2024 and 25% in 2023, excluding the Extra Week in 2023, and 25% in 2022. Delivery solutions growth was driven by the growth in demand across our Kroger Delivery network.\n(5)\nOther sales primarily relate to external sales at food production plants, third-party media revenue and data analytic services. The increase in 2024, compared to 2023, is primarily due to an increase in external sales at food production plants and in third-party media revenue\n. The increase in 2023, compared to 2022, is primarily due to an increase in data analytic services and third-party media revenue.\n(6)\n2023, 2023 adjusted and 2022 sales by category amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentation.\n​\nTotal sales decreased in 2024, compared to total 2023 adjusted sales, by 0.1%. Total 2023 adjusted sales represent total sales for 2023 excluding the Extra Week. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in supermarket fuel sales and the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, partially offset by an increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel. Total supermarket fuel sales decreased 8.4%, compared to 2023 adjusted supermarket fuel sales, primarily due to a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 5.9% and a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 2.6%. The decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel. Total sales, excluding fuel and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, adjusted for the Extra Week, increased 1.8% in 2024, compared to 2023, which was primarily due to our identical sales increase, excluding fuel, of 1.5%. Identical sales, excluding fuel, for 2024, compared to 2023, increased primarily due to increases in total and loyal households shopping with us, increased Health and Wellness sales and digital sales, partially offset by a reduction in the number of items in basket.\n​\nTotal 2023 adjusted sales decreased in 2023, compared to 2022, by 0.6%. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in supermarket fuel sales, partially offset by the increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel. Total sales, excluding fuel, adjusted for the Extra Week, increased 1.1% in 2023, compared to 2022, which was primarily due to our identical sales increase, excluding fuel, of 0.9%. Identical sales, excluding fuel, in 2023, compared to 2022, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of loyal households shopping with us and an increase in basket value due to retail inflation, partially offset by a reduction in the number of items in basket and the termination of our agreement with Express Scripts effective December 31, 2022. Identical sales, excluding fuel, would have grown 2.3% in 2023 if not for the approximately $1.8 billion reduction in pharmacy sales from the termination of our agreement with Express Scripts effective December 31, 2022. Total adjusted fuel sales decreased 12.3% in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 11.1% and a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 1.5%. The decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel. \n​\n34\n\n\nWe calculate identical sales, excluding fuel, as sales to retail customers, including sales from all departments at identical supermarket locations, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business and Delivery and Ship solutions. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. We define Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business as identical when physical locations have been in operation continuously for five full quarters; discontinued patient therapies are excluded from the identical sales calculation starting in the quarter of transfer or termination. Starting in the first quarter of 2024, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy businesses were not included in identical sales due to being classified as held for sale, while they were included in identical sales in fiscal year 2023. We completed the sale of the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business during the third quarter of 2024. We include sales from Kroger Delivery from customer fulfillment centers in the identical sales calculation if the delivery occurs in an existing Kroger supermarket geography or when the location has been in operation for five full quarters. Although identical sales is a relatively standard term, numerous methods exist for calculating identical sales growth. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate identical sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical sales. It is important to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical sales before comparing our identical sales to those of other such companies. Our identical sales results, excluding fuel, are summarized in the following table. We used the identical sales, excluding fuel, dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2024 and 2023.\n​\nIdentical Sales\n($ in millions)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n(1)\n    \n2023\n(2)\n \nExcluding fuel\n​\n$\n 128,297\n​\n$\n 126,378\n​\nExcluding fuel\n​\n \n 1.5\n%  \n \n 0.9\n%\n(1)\nIdentical sales, excluding fuel, for 2024 were calculated on a 52-week basis by excluding week 1 of fiscal 2023 in our 2023 identical sales base. \n(2)\nIdentical sales, excluding fuel, for 2023 were calculated on a 53-week basis by including week 1 of fiscal year 2023 in our 2022 identical sales base. \n​\nGross Margin, LIFO and FIFO Gross Margin\n​\nOur gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.26% in 2024 and 21.83% in 2023. This increase resulted primarily from the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business, which has a lower gross margin rate, strong \nOur Brands\n performance, lower shrink and decreased fuel sales, which has a lower gross margin rate, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. \n​\nThe following table provides the calculation of gross profit and gross margin in accordance with GAAP:\n​\nGross Margin\n($ in millions, except percentages)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n​\n2023\n​\nSales\n​\n$\n 147,123\n​\n​\n$\n 150,039\n​\nMerchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing and transportation and LIFO charge, excluding rent and depreciation and amortization\n​\n​\n 113,720\n​\n​\n​\n 116,675\n​\nRent\n​\n​\n 66\n​\n​\n​\n 68\n​\nDepreciation and amortization\n​\n​\n 589\n​\n​\n​\n 541\n​\nGross profit\n​\n$\n 32,748\n​\n​\n$\n 32,755\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross margin\n​\n​\n 22.26\n%\n​\n​\n 21.83\n%\n​\nOur LIFO charge was $95 million in 2024 and $113 million in 2023. The decrease in our LIFO charge was attributable to lower product cost inflation for 2024 compared to 2023.\n​\n35\n\n\nWe define FIFO gross margin as FIFO gross profit divided by sales. FIFO gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing and transportation expenses, but excluding the LIFO charge, rent and depreciation and amortization.\n​\nOur fuel sales lower our FIFO gross margin rate due to the very low FIFO gross margin rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. Excluding the effect of fuel and the Extra Week, our FIFO gross margin rate increased 32 basis points in 2024, compared to 2023. This increase resulted primarily from the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business, which has a lower gross margin rate, strong \nOur Brands\n performance and lower shrink, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. Excluding the effect of fuel, the Extra Week and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, our FIFO gross margin rate increased 14 basis points in 2024, compared to 2023.\n​\nOperating, General and Administrative Expenses\n​\nOG&A expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs such as wages, healthcare benefit costs, retirement plan costs, utilities, and credit card fees. Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A.\n​\nOG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 17.29% in 2024 and 17.50% in 2023. The decrease in 2024, compared to 2023, resulted primarily from the 2023 OG&A Adjusted Items and continued execution of broad-based cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, including store productivity, partially offset by the effect of decreased fuel sales, which increases our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business, which has a lower OG&A rate to sales, increased incentive plan costs, an increase in costs due to the severity of general liability claims, planned investment in associates and the 2024 OG&A Adjusted Items.\n​\nOur fuel sales lower our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. Excluding the effect of fuel, the Extra Week, the 2024 OG&A Adjusted Items and the 2023 OG&A Adjusted Items, our OG&A rate increased 31 basis points in 2024, compared to 2023. This increase resulted primarily from the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business, which has a lower OG&A rate to sales, increased incentive plan costs, an increase in costs due to the severity of general liability claims and planned investments in associates, partially offset by the broad-based improvement from cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, including store productivity. Excluding the effect of fuel, the Extra Week, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, the 2024 OG&A Adjusted Items and the 2023 OG&A Adjusted Items, our OG&A rate increased 19 basis points in 2024, compared to 2023.\n​\nRent Expense\n​\nRent expense remained relatively consistent, as a percentage of sales, for 2024 compared to 2023.\n​\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n​\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased, as a percentage of sales, in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to the Extra Week, additional depreciation associated with higher capital investments during 2024 and a decrease in the average useful life on these capital investments.\n​\nOperating Profit and FIFO Operating Profit\n​\nOperating profit was $3.8 billion, or 2.62% of sales, for 2024, compared to $3.1 billion, or 2.06% of sales, for 2023.  Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 56 basis points in 2024, compared to 2023, due to decreased OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales and a higher FIFO gross margin rate, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales, a decrease in fuel operating profit and the Extra Week.\n​\n36\n\n\nFIFO operating profit was $3.9 billion, or 2.68% of sales, for 2024, compared to $3.2 billion, or 2.14% of sales, for 2023. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales, excluding the 2024 and 2023 Adjusted Items and the Extra Week, decreased 8 basis points in 2024, compared to 2023, due to increased OG&A and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales, and a decrease in fuel operating profit, partially offset by a higher FIFO gross margin rate.\n​\nSpecific factors contributing to the trends driving operating profit and FIFO operating profit identified above are discussed earlier in this section.\n​\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of operating profit to FIFO operating profit, and to Adjusted FIFO operating profit, excluding the 2024 and 2023 Adjusted Items:\n​\nOperating Profit excluding the Adjusted Items\n($ in millions)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n​\nOperating profit\n​\n$\n 3,849\n​\n$\n 3,096\n​\nLIFO charge\n​\n​\n 95\n​\n​\n 113\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFIFO Operating profit\n​\n \n 3,944\n​\n \n 3,209\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAdjustment for merger related costs\n(1)\n​\n​\n 684\n​\n​\n 316\n​\nAdjustment for opioid settlement charges\n​\n​\n (27)\n​\n​\n 1,475\n​\nAdjustment for severance charge and related benefits\n​\n​\n 32\n​\n​\n —\n​\nAdjustment for impairment of intangible assets\n​\n​\n 30\n​\n​\n —\n​\nAdjustment for property losses\n​\n​\n 25\n​\n​\n —\n​\nOther\n​\n​\n (14)\n​\n​\n (14)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024 and 2023 Adjusted items\n​\n​\n 730\n​\n​\n 1,777\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAdjusted FIFO operating profit excluding the adjusted items above\n​\n$\n 4,674\n​\n$\n 4,986\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nExtra Week adjustment\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n (187)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAdjusted FIFO operating profit excluding the adjusted items above and the Extra Week\n​\n$\n 4,674\n​\n$\n 4,799\n​\n(1)\nMerger related costs primarily include third-party professional fees and credit facility fees associated with the terminated merger with Albertsons.\n​\nNet Interest Expense\n​\nNet interest expense totaled $450 million in 2024 and $441 million in 2023. Net interest expense increased in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to increased average total outstanding debt throughout 2024, compared to 2023, from the net proceeds of the senior notes issuance and the $34 million for merger-related net interest expense, partially offset by increased interest income earned on our cash and temporary cash investments due to increased balances of cash and temporary cash investments in 2024, compared to 2023. \n​\nIncome Taxes\n​\nOur effective income tax rate was 20.0% in 2024 and 23.5% in 2023. The 2024 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to a tax benefit from recognizing deferred tax assets related to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, the benefit from share-based payments and the utilization of tax credits, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. The 2023 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state income taxes and the nondeductible portion of opioid settlement charges, partially offset by the benefit from share-based payments and the utilization of tax credits.\n37\n\n\nNet Earnings and Net Earnings Per Diluted Share\n​\nOur net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the Results of Operations section.\n​\nNet earnings of $3.67 per diluted share for 2024 represented an increase of 24.0% compared to net earnings of $2.96 per diluted share for 2023. Excluding the 2024 and 2023 Adjusted Items and the Extra Week, adjusted net earnings of $4.47 per diluted share for 2024 represented a decrease of 2.0% compared to adjusted net earnings of $4.56 per diluted share for 2023. The decrease in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from decreased adjusted FIFO operating profit, excluding fuel, and decreased fuel earnings, partially offset by a decreased LIFO charge and lower net interest expense.\n​\nRETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL\n​\nWe calculate return on invested capital (“ROIC”) by dividing adjusted ROIC operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital. Adjusted operating profit for ROIC purposes is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit, and adding back our LIFO charge, depreciation and amortization and rent to our U.S. GAAP operating profit of the prior four quarters. Average invested capital is calculated as the sum of (i) the average of our total assets, (ii) the average LIFO reserve and (iii) the average accumulated depreciation and amortization; minus (i) the average taxes receivable, (ii) the average accounts payable, (iii) the average accrued salaries and wages and (iv) the average other current liabilities, excluding accrued income taxes. Averages are calculated for ROIC by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter, of the last four quarters, and dividing by two. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. ROIC should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital. Management believes ROIC is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets.\n​\nAlthough ROIC is a relatively standard financial term, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROIC. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of such other companies.\n​\n38\n\n\nThe following table provides a calculation of ROIC for 2024 and 2023 on a 52 week basis ($ in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal Year Ended\n​\n​\n​\nFebruary 1,\n​\nFebruary 3,\n​\n​\n    \n2025\n​\n2024\n \nReturn on Invested Capital\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNumerator\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOperating profit on a 53 week basis in fiscal year 2023\n​\n$\n 3,849\n​\n$\n 3,096\n​\nExtra Week operating profit adjustment\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n (187)\n​\nLIFO charge\n​\n \n 95\n​\n \n 113\n​\nDepreciation and amortization\n​\n \n 3,246\n​\n \n 3,125\n​\nRent on a 53 week basis in fiscal year 2023\n​\n \n 877\n​\n \n 891\n​\nExtra Week rent adjustment\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n (17)\n​\nAdjustment for severance charge and related benefits\n​\n​\n 32\n​\n​\n —\n​\nAdjustment for impairment of intangible assets\n​\n​\n 30\n​\n​\n —\n​\nAdjustment for property losses\n​\n​\n 25\n​\n​\n —\n​\nAdjustment for merger-related costs\n​\n​\n 684\n​\n​\n 316\n​\nAdjustment for opioid settlement charges\n​\n​\n (27)\n​\n​\n 1,475\n​\nAdjusted ROIC operating profit\n​\n$\n 8,811\n​\n$\n 8,812\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDenominator\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAverage total assets\n​\n$\n 51,561\n​\n$\n 50,064\n​\nAverage taxes receivable\n(1)\n​\n \n (124)\n​\n \n (197)\n​\nAverage LIFO reserve\n​\n \n 2,357\n​\n \n 2,253\n​\nAverage accumulated depreciation and amortization\n(2)\n​\n \n 33,397\n​\n \n 30,573\n​\nAverage accounts payable\n​\n \n (10,253)\n​\n \n (10,280)\n​\nAverage accrued salaries and wages\n​\n \n (1,327)\n​\n \n (1,535)\n​\nAverage other current liabilities\n​\n \n (3,551)\n​\n \n (3,414)\n​\nAverage invested capital\n​\n$\n 72,060\n​\n$\n 67,464\n​\nReturn on Invested Capital\n​\n \n 12.23\n%  \n \n 13.06\n%\n(1)\nTaxes receivable were $84 as of February 1, 2025, $163 as of February 3, 2024 and $231 as of January 28, 2023.\n(2)\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization includes depreciation for property, plant and equipment and amortization for definite-lived intangible assets.\n​\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n​\nWe have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n​\nWe believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\n​\n39\n\n\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets\n​\nWe monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a triggering event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If we identify impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value. Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. We recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $98 million in 2024, which includes $25 million, $19 million net of tax, for property losses and $69 million in 2023. We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as OG&A expense.\n​\nThe factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and competition. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results.\n​\nBusiness Combinations\n​\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. All the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition once we obtain control of an entity. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. We use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances, including the income approach. Significant estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. See Note 2 for further information about goodwill.\n​\nGoodwill\n​\nOur goodwill totaled $2.7 billion as of February 1, 2025. We review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events. We perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and other consolidated entities (collectively, “reporting units”) that have goodwill balances. Generally, fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment. We base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n​\nIn 2022, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for Vitacost.com totaling $160 million. The talent and capabilities gained through the merger with Vitacost in 2014 have been key to advancing Kroger’s digital platform and growing our digital business to more than $13 billion in annual sales. As our digital strategy has evolved, our primary focus looking forward will be to effectively utilize our Pickup and Delivery capabilities. This reprioritization resulted in reduced long-term profitability expectations and a decline in the market value for one underlying channel of business and led to the impairment charge. Vitacost.com will continue to operate as an online platform providing great value natural, organic, and eco-friendly products for customers.\n​\nThe annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2024, 2023 and 2022 did not result in impairment for any of our reporting units other than Vitacost.com described above. Based on current and future expected cash flows, we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely. A 10% reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance. \n​\n40\n\n\nFor additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2024, 2023 and 2022, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nThe impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce significantly different results. The cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy, competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses.\n​\nMulti-Employer Pension Plans\n​\nWe contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements. These multi-employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans.\n​\nWe recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with GAAP. We made cash contributions to these plans of $398 million in 2024, $635 million in 2023 and $620 million in 2022. The decrease in 2024, compared to 2023 and 2022, is due to the fulfillment of contractually obligated payments related to our commitments established when restructuring the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union-Industry Variable Annuity Pension Plan agreement.\n​\nWe continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans. These under-fundings are not our liability. When an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates, we may negotiate the restructuring of under-funded multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multi-employer pension plan. The commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these off-balance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating. We are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“IBT”) Consolidated Pension Fund and have sole investment authority over these assets. Significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements are: \n​\n●\nIn 2022, we incurred a $25 million charge, $19 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension funds.\n​\nAs we continue to work to find solutions to under-funded multi-employer pension plans, it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds.  \n​\nBased on the most recent information available to us, we believe the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that our contributions to most of these funds will increase over the next few years\n. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2024. Because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding. Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer.  \n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, we estimate our share of the underfunding of multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute was approximately $1.9 billion, $1.4 billion net of tax. As of December 31, 2023, we estimate our share of the underfunding of multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute was approximately $2.5 billion, $1.9 billion net of tax. This represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately $630 million, $482 million net of tax, as of December 31, 2024. The decrease in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to higher expected returns on assets in the funds as well as the receipt of American Rescue Plan Act (“ARP Act”) funding. Our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable.\n​\n41\n\n\nWe have made and disclosed this estimate not because, except as noted above, this underfunding is a direct liability of ours. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. In the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP. \n​\nThe amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi-employer pension plans, benefit payments or future restructuring agreements. The amount could decline, and our future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, our share of the underfunding could increase, and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. We continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans. Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours, any commitments to fund certain multi-employer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made.\n​\nThe ARP Act, which was signed into law on March 11, 2021, established a special financial assistance program for financially troubled multi-employer pension plans. Under the ARP Act, eligible multi-employer plans can apply to receive a cash payment in an amount projected by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to pay pension benefits through the plan year ending 2051. At the end of 2024, we expect certain multi-employer pension plans in which we participate, for which our estimated share of underfunding is approximately $665 million, $509 million net of tax, to apply for or receive funding in 2025, which may reduce a portion of our share of unfunded multi-employer pension plan liabilities.\n​\nSee Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi-employer pension plans.\n​\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n​\nRefer to Note 19 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted as of February 1, 2025.\n​\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n​\nCash Flow Information\n​\nThe following table summarizes our net increase in cash and temporary cash investments for 2024 and 2023:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n​\nFiscal Year\n​\n​\n2024\n    \n2023\nNet cash provided by (used in)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOperating activities\n​\n$\n 5,794\n​\n$\n 6,788\nInvesting activities\n​\n​\n (3,228)\n​\n​\n (3,750)\nFinancing activities\n​\n​\n (490)\n​\n​\n (2,170)\nNet increase in cash and temporary cash investments\n​\n$\n 2,076\n​\n$\n 868\n​\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n​\nWe generated $5.8 billion of cash from operations in 2024, compared to $6.8 billion in 2023. The decrease in cash generated from operations was primarily due to the following:\n​\n●\nAn increase in long-term liabilities at the end of 2023, compared to the end of 2022, primarily due to an increase in the noncurrent portion of our accrued opioid settlement charges;\n​\n42\n\n\n●\nCash flows for FIFO inventory were less favorable for 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease in FIFO inventory at the end of 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to maintaining inventory at optimal levels through improved inventory management planning\n;\n​\n●\nCash flows for accounts receivable were less favorable in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in pharmacy receivables at the end of 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to timing of cash receipts and increased Health and Wellness sales;\n​\n●\nPartially offset by cash flows for accrued expenses were more favorable in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to the following: \n​\no\nA decrease in accrued incentive plan costs at the end of 2023, compared to 2022;\n​\no\nA decrease in our commitments due to the UFCW International Union-Industry Pension Fund (“National Fund”) at the end of 2023, compared to 2022, as a result of the final contractual payment related to the multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability charge we incurred in 2020; and\n​\no\nAn increase in accrued interest expense at the end of 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to accrued interest expense associated with the net $5.8 billion senior notes issuance;\n​\no\nPartially offset by an increase in accrued legal expenses at the end of 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in the current portion of our accrued opioid settlement charges.\n​\nNet cash used by investing activities\n​\nInvesting activities used cash of $3.2 billion in 2024, compared to $3.8 billion in 2023. The amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business in 2024 and an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets related to the sale of an equity investment in 2024, partially offset by increased payments for property and equipment, including payments for lease buyouts.\n​\nNet cash used by financing activities\n​\nWe used $490 million of cash for financing activities in 2024, compared to $2.2 billion in 2023. The amount of cash used for financing activities decreased in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to increased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by increased payments on long-term debt including obligations under finance leases and increased payments on treasury stock purchases and unsettled accelerated share repurchases.\n​\n43\n\n\nCapital Investments\n​\nCapital investments, including changes in construction-in-progress payables and excluding the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $3.6 billion in 2024 and 2023. Capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $51 million in 2024. We did not purchase any leased facilities in 2023. Our capital priorities align directly with our value creation model and our target to consistently grow net earnings. Our capital program includes initiatives to enhance the customer experience in stores, improve our process efficiency and enhance our digital capabilities through technology developments. While our capital investments remained consistent in 2024, compared to 2023, we increased capital investments in store projects in 2024, compared to 2023, which was offset by decreased capital investments in supply chain and manufacturing projects and digital projects. These investments are expected to drive sales growth and improve operating efficiency by removing cost and waste from our business.\n​\nThe table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage for 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n​\nSupermarket Storing Activity\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\n \nBeginning of year\n \n 2,722\n \n 2,719\n \n 2,726\n​\nOpened\n \n 16\n \n 5\n \n 3\n​\nOpened (relocation)\n \n 7\n \n 2\n \n 1\n​\nClosed (operational)\n \n (7)\n \n (1)\n \n (10)\n​\nClosed (relocation)\n \n (7)\n \n (3)\n \n (1)\n​\nEnd of year\n \n 2,731\n \n 2,722\n \n 2,719\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal expansions\n(1)\n​\n 6\n​\n 3\n​\n —\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal remodels\n(2)\n​\n 210\n​\n 278\n​\n231\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal supermarket square footage (in millions)\n \n 182\n \n 180\n \n 179\n​\n(1)\nWe define an expansion as a project that expands the square footage of a store by at least 5,000 square feet or 15,000 square feet for stores greater than 95,000 square feet prior to the expansion. \n(2)\nWe define a remodel as a project that is greater than or equal to a cost of $8 per square foot. \n​\nDebt Management\n​\nTotal debt, including both the current and long-term portions of obligations under finance leases, increased $5.7 billion to $17.9 billion as of year-end 2024, compared to 2023. \nThis increase resulted primarily from the issuance of $10.5 billion senior notes, partially offset by the payment to redeem $4.7 billion of the senior notes that included a special mandatory redemption feature following the termination of the merger with Albertsons. After the termination of the proposed merger, these net proceeds were primarily used to fund the $5.0 billion ASR program to be completed under our December 2024 Repurchase Program. \n​\nCommon Share Repurchase Programs\n​\nOn December 11, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a $7.5 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions, including ASR transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “December 2024 Repurchase Program”). The December 2024 Repurchase Program authorization replaced the existing September 2022 Repurchase Program described below. \n​\nOn September 9, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act (the “September 2022 Repurchase Program”). No shares were repurchased under the September 2022 authorization.  \n​\n44\n\n\nOn December 30, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act (the “December 2021 Repurchase Program”). The December 2021 Repurchase Program was exhausted during 2022.\n​\nOn December 6, 1999, the Company announced a program to repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option and long-term incentive plans, under which repurchases are limited to proceeds received from exercises of stock options and the tax benefits associated therewith (“1999 Repurchase Program”). This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises.\n​\nOn December 19, 2024, we entered into an ASR agreement with two financial institutions to reacquire, in aggregate, $5.0 billion in shares of Kroger common stock. The ASR agreement will be completed under the December 2024 Repurchase Program. During 2024, we funded $5.0 billion and received a $4.0 billion initial delivery of approximately 65.6 million Kroger common shares at an average price of $61.54 per share, which includes excise taxes related to the shares repurchased. The total number of shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the ASR agreement will be based on the average of the volume-weighted average prices of Kroger common shares on specified dates during the term of each ASR agreement, less a discount, and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreement. Final settlement under the ASR agreement is expected to occur no later than the third fiscal quarter of our Fiscal 2025.\n​\nDuring 2024, we invested $4.2 billion to repurchase 68.4 million Kroger common shares at an average price of $61.31 per share, which includes excise taxes related to the shares repurchased. These shares were reacquired under the December 2024 Repurchase Program and the 1999 Repurchase Program. During 2023, we invested $62 million to repurchase 1.3 million Kroger common shares at an average price of $46.98 per share. These shares were reacquired under the 1999 Repurchase Program. During 2022, we invested $993 million to repurchase 19.4 million Kroger common shares at an average price of $51.29 per share.  These shares were reacquired under the December 2021 Repurchase Program and the 1999 Repurchase Program.\n​\nAs of February 1, 2025, there was $2.5 billion remaining under the December 2024 Repurchase Program, which reflects the reduction of the unsettled accelerated share repurchases of $1.0 billion and excludes excise tax on share repurchases in excess of issuances. Amounts available under the 1999 Repurchase Program are dependent upon option exercise activity. The authority remaining under the December 2024 Repurchase Program and the 1999 Repurchase Program do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time.\n​\nDividends\n​\nThe following table provides dividend information for 2024 and 2023 ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\nCash dividends paid\n$\n 883\n​\n$\n 796\nCash dividends paid per common share\n$\n 1.22\n​\n$\n 1.10\n​\nLiquidity Needs\n​\nWe held cash and temporary cash investments of $4.0 billion, as of the end of 2024, which reflects net proceeds from the $10.5 billion senior notes issuance, the payment to redeem $4.7 billion senior notes issued with a mandatory redemption feature following the termination of the merger with Albertsons, our elevated operating performance over the last few years and the commencement of the $5.0 billion ASR program to be completed under our December 2024 Repurchase Program. We actively manage our cash and temporary cash investments in order to internally fund operating activities, support and invest in our core businesses, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings and return cash to shareholders through cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions. We remain committed to our dividend, and growing our dividend over time, subject to board approval, as well as share repurchase programs and we will evaluate the optimal use of any excess free cash flow, consistent with our capital allocation strategy.\n45\n\n\nThe table below summarizes our short-term and long-term material cash requirements, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of February 1, 2025 (in millions of dollars):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2025\n    \n2026\n    \n2027\n    \n2028\n    \n2029\n    \nThereafter\n    \nTotal\n \nContractual Obligations\n(1)(2)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nLong-term debt\n(3)\n​\n$\n 104\n​\n$\n 1,300\n​\n$\n 606\n​\n$\n 675\n​\n$\n 583\n​\n$\n 12,641\n​\n$\n 15,909\n​\nInterest on long-term debt\n(4)\n​\n​\n 739\n​\n​\n 712\n​\n​\n 687\n​\n​\n 674\n​\n​\n 624\n​\n​\n 9,992\n​\n​\n 13,428\n​\nFinance lease obligations\n​\n​\n 261\n​\n​\n 262\n​\n​\n 265\n​\n​\n 259\n​\n​\n 255\n​\n​\n 1,280\n​\n​\n 2,582\n​\nOperating lease obligations\n​\n​\n 974\n​\n​\n 921\n​\n​\n 866\n​\n​\n 799\n​\n​\n 734\n​\n​\n 5,832\n​\n​\n 10,126\n​\nSelf-insurance liability\n(5)\n​\n​\n 345\n​\n​\n 158\n​\n​\n 110\n​\n​\n 73\n​\n​\n 42\n​\n​\n 115\n​\n​\n 843\n​\nConstruction commitments\n(6)\n​\n​\n 1,031\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n 1,031\n​\nOpioid settlement payments\n(7)\n​\n​\n 283\n​\n​\n 140\n​\n​\n 136\n​\n​\n 140\n​\n​\n 134\n​\n​\n 615\n​\n​\n 1,448\n​\nPurchase obligations\n(8)\n​\n​\n 700\n​\n​\n 398\n​\n​\n 216\n​\n​\n 122\n​\n​\n 114\n​\n​\n 692\n​\n​\n 2,242\n​\nTotal\n​\n$\n 4,437\n​\n$\n 3,891\n​\n$\n 2,886\n​\n$\n 2,742\n​\n$\n 2,486\n​\n$\n 31,167\n​\n$\n 47,609\n​\n(1)\nThe contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $37 million in 2024. For additional information about these obligations, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This table also excludes contributions under various multi-employer pension plans, which totaled $398 million in 2024. For additional information about these multi-employer pension plans, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(2)\nThe liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined.\n(3)\nAs of February 1, 2025, we had no outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility.\n(4)\nAmounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of February 1, 2025 and stated fixed and swapped interest rates, if applicable, for all other debt instruments.\n(5)\nThe amounts include self-insurance liabilities related to workers’ compensation claims and general liability claims. Workers’ compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis.\n(6)\nAmounts include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in “Accounts payable” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(7)\nAmounts include scheduled opioid settlement commitments. For additional information about our opioid settlement charges, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(8)\nAmounts include commitments, many of which are short-term in nature, to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our food production plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and food production plants. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We included our future commitments for customer fulfillment centers for which we have placed an order as of February 1, 2025. We did not include our commitments associated with additional customer fulfillment centers that have not yet been ordered. Future commitments for customer fulfillment centers will grow as we place orders for additional customer fulfillment centers.\n​\nWe expect to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs with cash and temporary cash investments on hand as of February 1, 2025, cash flows from our operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility. Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs include anticipated requirements for working capital to maintain our operations, pension plan commitments, interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper, servicing our lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, capital investments, scheduled opioid settlement payments and other purchase obligations. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund organic growth opportunities, additional customer fulfillment centers, joint ventures or other business partnerships, property development, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets. We believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current investment grade debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions\n.\n​\nFor additional information about our debt activity in 2024, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\n46\n\n\nFactors Affecting Liquidity\n​\nWe can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $2.75 billion under our commercial paper program. At February 1, 2025, we had no outstanding commercial paper. Commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility. If our short-term credit ratings fall, the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than $500 million on a daily basis. Factors that could affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance and financial position, the state of the economy, conditions in the food retail industry and changes in our business model. Further information on the risks and uncertainties that can affect our business can be found in the “Risk Factors” section set forth in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our Public Debt Rating. “Public Debt Rating” means, as of any date, the rating that has been most recently announced by either S&P or Moody’s, as the case may be, for any class of non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt issued by Kroger. As of March 27, 2025, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\n​\nOur credit facility requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio (our “financial covenant”). A failure to maintain our financial covenant would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. This financial covenant is described below:\n​\n●\nOur Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) was 1.54 to 1 as of February 1, 2025. If this ratio were to exceed 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our revolving credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired.\n​\nOur credit facility is more fully described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenant at February 1, 2025.\n​\nAs of February 1, 2025, we maintained a $2.75 billion, unsecured revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates on September 13, 2029. Outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility. As of February 1, 2025, we had no outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled $1 million as of February 1, 2025\n.\n​\nIn addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of February 1, 2025, we had authorized for issuance $2.0 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and effective on May 20, 2022.\n​\nWe maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self-insured workers’ compensation claims. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self-insured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately third-party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self-insured retention levels. These bonds do not represent liabilities of ours, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost or decrease the funds available under our credit facility if the letters of credit were issued against our credit facility. We had $478 million of outstanding surety bonds as of February 1, 2025. These surety bonds expire during fiscal year 2025 and are expected to be renewed.\n​\n47\n\n\nWe have standby letters of credit outstanding as part of our insurance program and for other business purposes. We had $261 million of outstanding standby letters of credit as of February 1, 2025. These standby letters of credit expire during fiscal year 2025 or early fiscal year 2026 and most are expected to be renewed. The letters of credit for our insurance program collateralize obligations to our insurance carriers in connection with the settlement of potential claims. We have also provided a letter of credit which supports our commitment to build a certain number of fulfillment centers. The balance of this letter of credit reduces primarily upon the construction of each fulfillment center. If we do not reach our total purchase commitment, we will be responsible for the balance remaining on the letter of credit.. Letters of credit do not represent liabilities of ours and are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nWe also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third-party logistics operators for certain expenses, including multi-employer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities.\n​\nIn addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third-party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability.\n​\n48",
