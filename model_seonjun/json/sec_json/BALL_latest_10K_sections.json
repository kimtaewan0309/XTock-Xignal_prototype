  "item1": "Item 1. Business\n​\nBall Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, Ball, the company, we or our) is one of the world’s leading suppliers of aluminum packaging for the beverage, personal care and household products industries. The company was organized in 1880 and incorporated in the state of Indiana, United States of America (U.S.), in 1922. Our sustainable, aluminum packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in facilities around the world. In 2024, our total consolidated net sales were $11.80 billion. In the third quarter of 2023, Ball entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (Agreement) with BAE Systems, Inc. (BAE) and, for the limited purposes set forth therein, BAE Systems plc, to sell all outstanding equity interests in Ball’s aerospace business to BAE. On February 16, 2024, the company completed the divestiture of the aerospace business. See \nNote 4\n \nfor further details.\n​\nOur largest product line is aluminum beverage containers and we also produce extruded aluminum aerosol containers, recloseable aluminum bottles across multiple consumer categories, aluminum slugs and aluminum cups. At December 31, 2024, the assets and liabilities of the aluminum cups operating segment are presented as current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet. See \nNote 4\n \nfor further details.  \n​\nWe sell our aluminum packaging products globally to large multinational beverage, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands, as well as to numerous regional customers. Our significant customers include top consumer packaging and beverage companies.\n​\nWe are headquartered in Westminster, Colorado, and our stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BALL.\n​\nOur Strategy\n​\nWe exist to unlock the infinite potential of aluminum to advance a world free from waste. By leveraging our competitive advantages of bringing our scale to sustainability, the power of our partnerships and the unmatched talent of our people we will deliver on our promise of We Care…  We Work… We Win… \n​\nWe maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on executing an efficient operating model to deliver comparable diluted earnings per share growth in excess of 10 percent per annum over the long-term, maximize cash flow, increase Economic Value Added (EVA®) dollars and return value to shareholders. \n​\nThe cash generated by our businesses is used primarily: (1) to finance the company’s operations, (2) to service the company’s debt, (3) to return value to our shareholders via stock buybacks and dividend payments, and (4) to fund organic or inorganic growth investments. From time to time, we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible transactions that we believe will benefit the company and our shareholders, which may include strategic acquisitions, divestitures of parts of our company or equity investments. At any time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations at various stages of development with respect to one or more possible transactions or may have entered into non-binding letters of intent. As part of any such initiatives, we may participate in processes being run by other companies or leading our own activities. The compensation of many of our employees is tied to the company’s performance through our EVA®-based incentive programs.\n​\nSustainability \n​\nAt Ball Corporation, we deliver circular aluminum packaging solutions and exist to unlock the infinite potential of aluminum to advance a world free from waste. \n​\nOur approach to sustainability has evolved over the past 20 years. Today, Ball’s sustainability strategy is driven by high standards around carbon footprint reduction and the circularity of our products. Utilizing strategic partnerships across our value chain, we work to simplify sustainability for our customers by delivering scalable solutions that enable us to win together. This includes aligning our own 2030 Sustainability Goals and strategy to our customers’ climate-related targets, sustainability goals and regulatory requirements. \n​\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe focus our sustainability efforts on environmental, social and governance impacts. Our vision is to advance sustainability through aluminum packaging. This is exhibited through our commitment to achieve a science-based 55 percent reduction in our greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint by 2030 and net zero carbon emissions prior to 2050. In addition, Ball is committed to hiring, training and retaining a highly qualified and high-performing employee population to work in our manufacturing facilities and offices, and we do so with the intention of having a skilled and engaged workforce.\n​\nOur innovation and manufacturing teams around the world focus on continuously driving operational excellence in support of Ball’s resource efficiency goals. This drives process optimization, including products designed for optimum metal efficiency, real time monitoring to improve energy efficiency and reuse of water, as well as the reduction of waste and spoilage within our manufacturing plants. Our commitment extends beyond our walls and includes purchasing aluminum from Aluminum Stewardship Initiative (ASI) certified sustainable sources and reducing value chain emissions, all in order to facilitate the achievement of Ball and its customers’ sustainability targets.\n​\nToday’s consumers are increasingly choosing brands based on their sustainability credentials. Ball customers understand this growing priority and their unique position in impacting the environment, especially through the packaging materials they use. In addition, with growing packaging design regulations around the world, aluminum cans are well positioned to incur low compliance costs due to circularity credentials, such as favorable recycling rates and recycled content. As of 2023, Ball beverage cans contained 70 percent recycled content on average globally. Aluminum packaging unlocks the full potential of packaging to help customers convey their purpose to consumers, while limiting regulatory exposure. We are committed to moving toward a truly circular economy, where materials can be, and actually are, used again and again.\n​\nAluminum cans, bottles and cups are an attractive option for sustainability-conscious brands with commitments to real world recyclability and increasing their usage of recycled materials in consumer packaging. Aluminum containers are designed to be recycled without losing quality and retain a high economic value, pushing aluminum collection, sorting and recycling rates to the highest of any beverage packaging material. That is why 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced is still in use today. \n​\nAt a global 71 percent recycling rate with low yield losses and high product-to-product recycling loops, aluminum beverage packaging is the leader not only in recycling, but in circularity. Because recycling aluminum saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary aluminum production, we are innovating and collaborating with our customers, supply chain, industry groups and other public and private partners to establish and financially support initiatives to increase recycling rates around the world. We work together to create effective collection and recycling systems, and educate consumers about the sustainability and circularity benefits of aluminum packaging. \n​\nAt Ball, we believe our people and our culture enable our success and make it possible for us to deliver on our promises to customers, investors, communities and all of our stakeholders. We are working hard to create a culture and environment in which zero injuries become the reality, so everyone working for or within Ball gets home safe and healthy to their families and friends every day. We continue to invest in hiring, training and retaining our employees at every level across the organization to ensure we have the right people with the right skills in the right roles, and are providing them with opportunities to advance their careers. This includes a global Belonging, Inclusion and Diversity (BI&D) strategy, which ensures we have a sustainable workforce, and foster a safe and inclusive work environment where everyone feels they belong and are valued for their differences and contributions. A focus on BI&D among individuals and teams helps to unleash ideas and fuel innovation, driving growth and economic value throughout our global organization.\n​\nA healthy and sustainable business also depends on thriving communities. Ball’s commitment to the communities where we live and operate is an integral part of our corporate culture, as we continue to support organizations, programs and civic initiatives that advance sustainable livelihoods. Community engagement is how our company and our employees enrich the places where we live and work beyond providing jobs, benefits and paying local taxes. Through the Ball Foundation, corporate giving, employee giving and volunteerism, we invest in the future of the communities that sustain us. Each year Ball and its employees donate, volunteer and support non-profit organizations centered on building sustainable communities through recycling, education, and disaster preparedness and relief initiatives.\n​\nThe company’s focus towards sustainability has been recognized by external organizations. For the seventh year in a row, Ball received an A- score in CDP’s climate change program. In addition, Ball earned a MSCI AAA ESG rating, \n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nreceived a Gold Medal in recognition of overall sustainability achievements through EcoVadis and was recognized as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek.\n​\nHuman Capital and Employees \n​\nBall Corporation’s people are its greatest asset and we are proud to outline the material aspects of our human capital program. At the end of 2024, the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 16,000 employees, including approximately 5,000 employees in the U.S. Details of collective bargaining agreements are included within \nItem 1A, Risk Factors\n of this annual report.\n​\nOur Culture\n​\nEmbracing our rich 145-year history, we are a company that respects and values each of our employees and their collective desire to deliver value to all our stakeholders. We embrace our diversity and are “one Ball” in valuing: \n​\n●\nLeading with integrity;\n●\nWorking to create an enduring impact; and\n●\nWinning through our customer focus\n​\nBelonging, Inclusion & Diversity\n​\nAt Ball, fostering a workplace where every employee feels valued and empowered to contribute their best work has been an essential part of our success. Since 2015, we have had a dedicated focus on inclusion, recognizing that a diverse workforce enhances innovation, collaboration, and business outcomes. In 2024, we expanded this focus to include Belonging, reinforcing our commitment to creating an environment where all employees feel respected, connected, and supported in their professional growth.\n​\nOur Global Inclusion Council, sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, serves as a platform for collaboration and alignment on key Belonging, Inclusion & Diversity (BI&D) priorities. Our leaders across all business segments are committed to cultivating a workplace where every employee can thrive. We remain committed to furthering our efforts in ensuring a highly qualified workforce – diverse and non-diverse, reinforcing our belief that an inclusive and engaged workforce drives long-term business success.\n​\nOur approach to BI&D is integrated into our broader talent and business strategy. We prioritize fostering an inclusive culture, ensuring equitable access to opportunities, and supporting a workplace that reflects the diverse perspectives of the communities where we operate.\n​\nTalent\n​\nAttracting, developing and retaining top talent is essential to our success. Over the past decade, we have expanded our talent management organization with dedicated acquisition and development functions, implementing rigorous hiring processes and standardized assessments to align with our cultural values and strategic goals.\nEmbedded in our approach is the “Inspire, Connect, Achieve” leadership framework, which defines clear behaviors for people leaders to drive performance and cultural alignment. We have also strengthened succession planning through a holistic strategy that combines challenging assignments, formal development plans and professional coaching to build a strong pipeline of future leaders.\nThese efforts ensure we maintain a high-performing, engaged workforce ready to achieve our long-term objectives.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTraining and Development\n​\nWe are committed to fostering a culture of continuous learning and development, equipping our employees with the skills and resources needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving business environment. To complement this, our performance enablement approach prioritizes employee growth and continuous improvement. The performance enablement methodology encourages regular, meaningful performance conversations between managers and employees, while actively mitigating bias and fostering a fair and enriching developmental experience. These efforts enhance the data available for talent discussions and decision-making.\n​\nWe believe that investing in our employees’ growth is essential to driving both individual and organizational success, which is why we provide comprehensive resources to support learning and development at all levels:\n●\nBall Academy Platform: A seamless and unified learning experience designed to help employees thrive, grow and achieve their fullest potential.\n●\nLeadership Development Programs: Tailored programs for leaders at all levels that blend theoretical knowledge with practical application.\n●\nLinkedIn Learning Access: Available to all employees for self-paced learning and skill enhancement.\n●\nProfessional Coaching: Personalized development opportunities through a partnership with a global coaching firm.\n●\nEducational Support: Tuition reimbursement and instructional programs for continuous learning.\n●\nLeadership Communications: Monthly newsletters for leaders addressing timely topics such as team wellbeing, managing change, setting goals, improving team performance, fostering belonging and inclusion and sharing effective leadership practices.\n●\nCompliance Training: Annual training on compliance, antitrust, bribery, corruption and our business code of conduct for key management, sales and supply chain personnel.\nThese initiatives reflect our commitment to investing in our employees’ development, enhancing their skills and cultivating a culture of continuous learning and growth.\nEmployee Engagement\nIn 2024, Ball Corporation faced a year of transformation, introducing a new operating model and brand identity. Amid these changes, the company prioritized keeping employees informed and engaged, underscoring its commitment to fostering trust and unity across the organization.\nAn employee engagement survey conducted in October 2024 demonstrated the resilience of Ball's workforce. With an impressive global response rate of 81 percent, the survey revealed strong alignment with the company’s vision and values. Employees expressed pride in being part of Ball and confidence in its future. Engagement levels remained robust, with scores exceeding or meeting industry norms in key areas, including overall engagement and inclusion and belonging.\nInsights from the employee engagement survey are guiding Ball's efforts to develop action plans that address employee feedback and build on the company’s strengths. As Ball looks to 2025, the focus remains on driving higher engagement and advancing team effectiveness to sustain a culture of collaboration and innovation.\nTotal Rewards\n​\nOur global total rewards philosophy enables business performance by offering comprehensive total rewards that attract, retain and motivate our employees and promote their overall wellbeing. In addition, our competitive pay positioning strategy allows employees to share in business success and be rewarded through a variety of compensation opportunities reflective of their individual potential and contributions. Base pay is positioned in a competitive range of the applicable market median in each jurisdiction, differentiated based on skills, knowledge and experience, and designed to attract and retain the best talent. Beginning in 2025, we have introduced a common enterprise-wide approach for enabling individual performance and delivering competitive incentive rewards, which are key to advancing our business and strengthening our One Ball winning culture. Our short-term incentive plan for salaried employees will reward individual \n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nperformance as well as company performance, thereby encouraging a high-performing culture. Long-term incentives for our most senior employees aid retention and provide a longer-term focus on key business metrics. We also have programs which provide additional opportunity for, and retention of, our employees who show the highest potential to develop into future leaders.\n \n​\nHealth, Safety and Wellbeing\n​\nThe health, safety and wellbeing of all employees is a top priority at Ball. Our environmental, health and safety function and our operations executives partner to consistently reinforce policies and procedures that are designed to reduce workplace risks and ensure safe methods of plant production, including through regular training and reporting on injuries and lost-time incidents.

The transaction represents a strategic shift; therefore, the company’s consolidated financial statements reflect the aerospace business’ financial results as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The aerospace business was historically presented as a reportable segment. Effective as of the first quarter of 2024, the company reports its financial performance in the three reportable segments outlined below: (1) beverage packaging, North and Central America; (2) beverage packaging, Europe, Middle East and Africa (beverage packaging, EMEA) and (3) beverage packaging, South America. Ball also has investments in the U.S., Guatemala, Panama and Vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Additional financial information related to each of our segments is included in \nItem 7\n Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in \nNote 3\n to the consolidated financial statements within \nItem 8\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (annual report).\n​\nBeverage Packaging, North and Central America, Segment \n​\nBeverage packaging, North and Central America, is Ball’s largest segment, accounting for 48 percent of consolidated net sales in 2024. Aluminum beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other beverages.\n​\nAluminum beverage containers and ends are produced at 16 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., one in Canada and two in Mexico. The beverage packaging, North and Central America, segment also includes interests in three investments that are accounted for using the equity method.\n \nBall permanently ceased production at its aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility in Kent, Washington in the first quarter of 2024.\n​\nAccording to publicly available information and company estimates, the North American aluminum beverage container industry represents approximately 138 billion units. Five companies manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Ball, the largest producer in the region, shipped approximately 48 billion aluminum beverage containers in North and Central America in 2024, which represented approximately 34 percent of the aggregate shipments in these countries. Historically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend to be highest during the period from April through September. All of the beverage containers produced by Ball in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are made of aluminum. In North and Central America, a diverse base of more than six global suppliers provide almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements\n.\n​\nBeverage containers are sold based on price, quality, service, innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market, which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably. In addition, the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries.\n​\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass-through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.\n​\nBeverage Packaging, EMEA, Segment\n​\nThe beverage packaging, EMEA, segment accounted for 29 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2024. Our EMEA region operations include 19 facilities throughout Europe and one facility each in Cairo, Egypt, and Manisa, Turkey. \nIn the third quarter of 2022, Ball completed the sale of its aluminum beverage packaging business located in Russia, which included three aluminum beverage can manufacturing facilities.\n For the countries in which we currently operate, the aluminum beverage container market is approximately 93 billion containers, and we are the largest producer with an estimated 39 percent of shipments in this region. The markets served by our beverage packaging, EMEA, segment, including Egypt and Turkey, are highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix. Four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in EMEA. Our EMEA beverage facilities, shipped 36 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2024. \n​\nHistorically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in EMEA tend to be highest during the period from May through August, with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the U.K. Much like in other parts of the world, the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink, beer, juice and water industries. These trends are evolving, however, as customers, regulators and non-governmental organizations continue to press for more sustainable packaging in the wake of the global pollution crisis. More and more brands are choosing aluminum beverage packaging because of its closed-loop recyclability and other sustainability credentials. Using a new calculation implemented by the European Union (EU) in 2022, the overall recycling rate for aluminum beverage cans in the EU, U.K., Switzerland, Norway and Iceland was approximately 75 percent in 2022. \n​\nRaw material supply contracts in this region generally have longer term agreements. Five global aluminum suppliers provide almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements. The company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies. We limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass-through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.\n​\nBeverage Packaging, South America, Segment\n​\nThe beverage packaging, South America, segment accounted for 17 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2024. Our operations consist of 12 facilities—9 in Brazil and one each in Argentina, Chile and Paraguay. For the countries where we operate, the South American aluminum beverage container market is approximately 43 billion containers, and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 45 percent of South American shipments in 2024. Four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in the regions served by our beverage packaging, South America, segment. The company’s South American beverage facilities shipped approximately 19 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2024. \n​\nHistorically, sales volumes of beverage containers in South America tend to be highest during the period from September through December. In South America, two global suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum can and end sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from Asia.\n​\nWe limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass-through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.\n​\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther\n​\nOther consists of a non-reportable operating segment (beverage packaging, other) that manufactures and sells aluminum beverage containers in India, Saudi Arabia and Myanmar; a non-reportable operating segment that manufactures and sells extruded aluminum aerosol containers and recloseable aluminum bottles across multiple consumer categories as well as aluminum slugs (personal & home care, formerly aerosol packaging) throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia; a non-reportable operating segment that manufactures and sells aluminum cups (aluminum cups); undistributed corporate expenses; and intercompany eliminations and other business activities.\n​\nBeverage Packaging, Other\n​\nOur aluminum beverage packaging operations in the beverage packaging, other, segment consist of four facilities – two in India and one each in Saudi Arabia and Myanmar. Our aluminum can and end sheet requirements are provided by several suppliers. Our manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, Ball United Arab Can Manufacturing Company, is an investment 51 percent owned by Ball and consolidated in our results. In November 2024, the company entered into an agreement to sell 41 percent of its share in Ball United Arab Can Manufacturing Company, which will trigger deconsolidation upon closing of the transaction. See \nNote 4\n \nfor further details.\n \nAdditionally, Ball has ownership interests in an equity method investment in Vietnam. \n​\nPersonal & Home Care\n​\nOur personal & home care (PHC) operations manufacture and sell extruded aluminum aerosol containers, recloseable aluminum bottles across multiple consumer categories, and aluminum slugs, which represented less than 5 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2024. There are 10 manufacturing facilities that manufacture these products – six in Europe and one each in Canada, Brazil, Mexico and India. Included within the PHC facility count are facilities in Lummen, Belgium and Llinars del Vallés, Spain that the company acquired in late-October 2024 through the acquisition of the entire share capital of Alucan Entec, S.A. See \nNote 4\n \nfor further details regarding this acquisition. The PHC market in which we operate shipped approximately 8.2 billion units in 2024 and we are one of the major producers in this market with shipments of 1.5 billion aluminum PHC containers, representing approximately 19 percent of total shipments in the market. Our aluminum PHC requirements are provided by several suppliers. \n​\nAluminum Cups\n​\nAt December 31, 2024, the assets and liabilities of the aluminum cups operating segment are presented as current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet. See \nNote 4\n \nfor further details.\n​\nPatents\n​\nIn the opinion of the company’s management, none of our active patents or groups of patents is material to the successful operation of our business as a whole. We manage our intellectual property portfolio to obtain the durations necessary to achieve our business objectives.\n​\nResearch and Development\n​\nResearch and development (R&D) efforts are primarily directed toward packaging innovation, specifically the development of new features, sizes, shapes and types of containers, as well as new uses for existing containers. Other R&D efforts seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products. Our R&D activities are primarily conducted in a technical center located in Westminster, Colorado.\n​\nWhere to Find More Information\n​\nBall Corporation is subject to the reporting and other information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).
