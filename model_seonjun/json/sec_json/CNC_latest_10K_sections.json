Centene is a leading healthcare enterprise that is committed to helping people live healthier lives. The Company takes a local approach – with local brands and local teams – to provide fully integrated, high-quality and cost-effective services to government-sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. Centene offers affordable and high-quality products to more than 1 in 15 individuals across the nation, including Medicaid and Medicare members (including Medicare Prescription Drug Plans) as well as individuals and families served by the Health Insurance Marketplace.\nCentene provides access to high-quality healthcare, innovative programs and a wide range of health solutions that help families and individuals get well, stay well and be well. Our uniquely local approach – with local brands and local teams who live in, care about and directly influence the communities they serve – is a key differentiator in our ability to provide access to quality care to our members. Centene treats the whole person, an approach that is delivered locally and backed by the scale of Centene's expertise, data and resources. Through this approach and our commitment to sustainable partnerships, we work with local community organizations to realize our mission of transforming the health of the communities we serve, one person at a time.\nWe are focused on making strategic decisions and investments to create additional value in the short-term and to seek opportunities that position the organization for long-term strength, profitability, growth and innovation. In addition to creating shareholder value, we are modernizing and improving how we work in order to propel our organization to new levels of success and elevate the member and provider experiences.\nDuring 2024, we operated in four segments: Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial and Other. \n•\nMedicaid - \nincludes the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program; Medicaid Expansion programs; the Aged, Blind or Disabled (ABD) program; the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS); Foster Care; Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMP), which cover beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare; and other state-based programs.\n•\nMedicare - \nincludes Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs) and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDP), also known as Medicare Part D.\n•\nCommercial - \nincludes the Health Insurance Marketplace product along with individual, small group and large group commercial health insurance products.\n•\nOther - \nincludes our pharmacy operations, Envolve Benefit Options' vision and dental services, clinical healthcare, behavioral health, the TRICARE program, and corporate management companies, among others.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial and Other segments accounted for 62%, 14%, 21% and 3%, respectively, of our total external revenues. Our membership totaled 28.6 million as of December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our total revenues and net earnings attributable to Centene were $163.1 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, and our total cash flow from operations was $154 million.\nOur initial health plan commenced operations in Wisconsin in 1984. We were organized in Wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"CNC.\"\n1\nTable of Contents\nINDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS\nWe provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare and commercial products.\nMedicaid\nMedicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States and provides health insurance to low-income families and individuals with disabilities. Medicaid is funded jointly by federal and state governments, with the majority of funding provided by the federal government and administered by the states. Each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages, payment rates and program administration within federal standards. As a result, there are 56 Medicaid programs - one for each U.S. state, each U.S. territory and the District of Columbia. Eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets, often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level. Many states have selected Medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs.\nMedicaid helps meet the needs of various populations through the following products and programs:\n•\nThe TANF program covers low-income families with children.\n•\nMedicaid Expansion covers all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, subject to each state's election. The federal government pays 90% of the costs for Medicaid Expansion coverage for these beneficiaries.\n•\nThe ABD program covers low-income individuals with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments. ABD beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid recipients and typically utilize more services as a result of their more complicated health status.\n•\nCHIP helps to expand coverage primarily to children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford private health insurance. Historically, children have represented the largest Medicaid eligible population. Costs are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care, which tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues predominantly affecting the adult population. \n•\nLTSS is a Medicaid product that covers Institutional/Residential Care (Nursing and Intermediate Care Facilities) and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living. The largest groups receiving LTSS, by spending, are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities, followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, those with serious mental illness and/or serious emotional disturbance and other populations. States are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated, holistic care to their LTSS beneficiaries.\n•\nThe majority of children in foster care qualify for Medicaid. The federal government has enacted legislation establishing requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and well-being of children in foster care, including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with Medicaid. In addition, under the ACA, former foster care children are eligible for Medicaid until the age of 26, provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in Medicaid at that time.\n•\nA portion of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual-eligible, low-income seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare. According to CMS, there were more than 12 million dual-eligible enrollees in 2023. These members may receive assistance from Medicaid for benefits, such as nursing home care, HCBS and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost-sharing depending on their income level. Dual-eligibles use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues. We serve dual-eligibles primarily through our ABD, LTSS, MMP and Medicare Advantage D-SNPs lines of business.\n2\nTable of Contents\nWhile Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage, they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access healthcare. Medicaid recipients in non-managed care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. When they do seek care, it is typically fragmented and not coordinated such as seeking healthcare in hospital emergency departments, which is typically more expensive. As a result, many states without managed care programs have found that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory.\nAccordingly, in an effort to improve quality of care and the affordability of healthcare, the majority of states have mandated that their TANF recipients enroll in managed care plans and many are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach for additional populations and products. CMS estimates the total Medicaid program will grow from $877 billion in 2023 to $1.2 trillion by 2030. Medicaid spending is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 5% between 2023 and 2030. Additionally, approximately 40% of Medicaid spend in 2023 was in Medicaid fee-for-service. Based on these trends, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations (MCOs) with operations and programs focused on the distinct socio-economic, cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the Medicaid populations.\nWe are the largest Medicaid health insurer in the country, serving 13 million Medicaid recipients in 30 states as of December 31, 2024. Our Medicaid contracts with the states of Florida and New York accounted for approximately 10% or more of our consolidated Medicaid premium revenues individually in the year ended December 31, 2024.\nMedicare\nMedicare is the federal health insurance program for people ages 65 and over, which was expanded to cover people under 65 with certain disabilities and people with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. Medicare consists of four parts, labeled A through D. Part A provides hospitalization benefits financed largely through Social Security taxes and requires beneficiaries to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Part B provides benefits for medically necessary services and supplies including outpatient care, physician services and home health care. Parts A and B are referred to as Original Medicare.\nAs an alternative to Original Medicare, beneficiaries may elect to receive their Medicare benefits through Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage. Under Medicare Advantage, MCOs contract with CMS to provide services directly to Medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups. MCOs typically receive fixed monthly premium per member from CMS that varies based upon the county in which the member resides, demographic factors of the member such as age, gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member. Any benefits that are not covered by Medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from CMS that may be allocated to these benefits, according to CMS regulations and guidance. Typically, as our Medicare Advantage members reach their deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, our medical costs rise, creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the total Medicare market will grow from $1.0 trillion in 2023 to $1.6 trillion by 2030. Medicare spending is estimated to have increased 6% in fiscal 2024 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 7% between 2023 and 2030. Over 40% of Medicare spend in 2023 was in Medicare fee-for-service, representing a notable market opportunity to increase penetration of the Medicare Advantage products.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we served 1.1 million Medicare Advantage members across 37 states, primarily under the brand name Wellcare, with the highest concentration of lower-income, complex members compared to our peers. Revenues from CMS are significant to the segment. Consistent with our strategy, we have reduced our Medicare Advantage footprint to 32 states as of January 1, 2025.\n3\nTable of Contents\nDual-Eligible Alignment\nRecently finalized CMS regulations are promoting greater alignment and integration for dual-eligible members across both programs, whereby full dual beneficiaries would be enrolled under the same company's Medicaid and Medicare plan, improving the quality of care and overall member experience. With over 70% of the approximately 12 million fully-eligible duals population not in fully-integrated coverage arrangements, we see significant opportunity to advance care management, improve member engagement and improve the affordability of healthcare through this process. D-SNPs offer various levels of integration of benefits, care coordination (e.g., care management), and processes (e.g., appeals and grievances, claims, materials) depending on the plan type. Fully Integrated Dual Eligible (FIDE) plans provide Medicaid and Medicare benefits, including LTSS and/or behavior health through one plan under one legal entity. Highly Integrated Dual Eligible (HIDE) plans can offer Medicaid and Medicare benefits from different plans under different legal entities owned by the same parent organization. These HIDE plans have some differences in the Medicaid benefit offering requirements compared to FIDE plans. Lastly, Coordination-Only Dual Eligible plans can coordinate care with Medicaid fee-for-service or Medicaid MCOs from different parent organizations and in some states can also serve partial dual-eligibles who do not receive full Medicaid benefits. Accordingly, we have been refining our Medicare footprint to overlap more closely with our Medicaid presence to provide D-SNP offerings that support alignment.\nNewly finalized CMS regulations will require beneficiaries dually enrolled in Medicare and in a Medicaid managed care plan to receive integrated care through the Medicaid company's Medicare Advantage D-SNPs beginning in 2030, with certain restrictions beginning in 2027. We believe we are positioned well given our overlapping Medicaid and Medicare Advantage footprints and we will continue to place enterprise-level focus on the D-SNP opportunity to drive long-term growth.\nMedicare Prescription Drug Plan\nMedicare prescription drug coverage, or Medicare Part D, is a voluntary benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the participating drug plans and by providing a portion of reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs. The government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage, adjusted for risk factor payments. Additional subsidies are provided for dually eligible beneficiaries and specified low-income beneficiaries.\nMCOs contract with CMS to serve as plan sponsors offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDPs to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. PDPs offer national in-network prescription drug coverage, and may include a preferred pharmacy network, subject to limitations in certain circumstances. Unless CMS is notified of non-renewal and the non-renewal is effectuated by not filing a bid in June, Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS are renewed for successive one-year terms each September. Should CMS decide not to renew a contract, CMS must notify MCOs on or before August 1, and the plan would be terminated effective December 31 of that year. Our 2025 PDP bids resulted in 33 of the 34 CMS regions for which we were below the benchmarks and one region for which we were above the benchmark, compared to 30 of 34 CMS regions for which we were below the benchmark for the 2024 PDP bids.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) significantly changes Medicare PDPs in 2025, most notably by eliminating the coverage gap and capping members' annual out-of-pocket cost at $2,000 in order to provide more predictable and affordable prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The IRA changes effective for 2025 result in a meaningful shift in cost-sharing responsibilities between members, drug companies, CMS, and PDPs and will result in a significant increase in our premiums in consideration for our PDPs responsibility for a larger portion of total Part D benefit costs. \nWe served 6.9 million members as of December 31, 2024, the country's largest PDP carrier. We began providing PDP coverage in 2006 and offer stand-alone PDPs in 50 states and the District of Columbia with a priority on plans that offer low premiums, deductibles, and cost sharing. \nCommercial\nWe offer commercial health insurance products to individuals through the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace, and through large and small employer groups. These plans offer differing benefit designs and varying levels of co-payments at different premium rates. These plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members through network contracts with physicians, hospitals and other providers. Coverage typically is subject to copays and can also be subject to deductibles and coinsurance. As our commercial members reach their deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, our medical costs rise, creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year.\n4\nTable of Contents\nThe ACA created the Health Insurance Marketplace, which is a key component of the ACA and provides an opportunity for individuals and families to obtain health insurance. States have the option of operating their own Marketplace or partnering with the federal government. States choosing neither option default to the federally-facilitated Marketplace. Insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\nPremium subsidies are provided to individuals and families without access to other coverage and with incomes above 100% of the federal poverty level to make coverage more affordable. Consumers who qualify for subsidies may choose how much of the tax credit to apply to their premiums each month, up to the maximum amount for which they are eligible. The amount of subsidy an enrollee may receive depends on household income and the cost of the second lowest cost silver plan available to enrollees in their local area. Temporary enhanced subsidies were made available by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which were further extended through 2025 pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act.\nWe are the largest Marketplace carrier, serving 4.4 million members across 29 states as of December 31, 2024, under the brand name Ambetter Health. Revenues from CMS are significant to the segment.\nWe see an opportunity for market disruption of employer-sponsored insurance through Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRAs). An ICHRA allows employers of all sizes to directly reimburse employees for individual health insurance premiums and qualifying medical expenses tax free in lieu of traditional employer-sponsored health insurance. The ICHRA model relies heavily on off-exchange, individual health insurance coverage as the most efficient way to use the funds. These off-exchange plans often mimic employer-provided coverage in benefit design. They are designed to provide comprehensive, consistent coverage and benefits that meet members' needs.\nUsing an ICHRA allows employees to tap into a more competitive health plan marketplace and a larger risk pool, creating stronger potential for lower, more stable premiums. At the same time, this approach allows employees to find products that better fit their needs. Given the full commercial group market covers over 170 million, we see a significant addressable market over the long term. We have launched plans designed to attract ICHRA membership in off-exchange plans in 6 states in 2025. \nOther\nOur Other segment includes:\n•\nSpecialty Pharmacy. \nAcariaHealth offers comprehensive specialty pharmacy services customized for complex and chronic conditions through enhanced patient care offerings and collaborative partnerships with providers to optimize patient outcomes.\n•\nBehavioral Health. \nMagellan Health, Inc. (Magellan) supports innovative ways of accessing better health through technology, while remaining focused on the critical personal relationships that are necessary to achieve a healthy, vibrant life. Magellan's customers include health plans and other MCOs, employers, labor unions, various military and state and federal governmental agencies and third-party administrators.\n•\nVision and Dental Services. \nEnvolve Benefit Options coordinates benefits beyond traditional medical benefits to offer fully integrated vision and dental health services. Our vision benefit program administers routine and surgical eye care benefits through a contracted national network of eye care providers. Through the dental benefit, we are dedicated to improving oral health through a contracted network of dental healthcare providers.\n•\nClinical Healthcare. \nCommunity Medical Group (CMG) provides clinical healthcare, encompassing primary care, access to certain specialty services and a suite of social and other support services. CMG operates in Florida through an at-risk primary care provider model, focusing on clinical and social care for at-risk beneficiaries. Additionally, Denova Collaborative Health provides outpatient primary care and behavioral healthcare services.\n•\nFederal Services.\n Health Net Federal Services had a Managed Support Contract in the West Region for the Department of Defense (DoD) TRICARE program. We provided administrative services to Military Health System eligible beneficiaries, which included eligible active duty service members and their families, retired service members and their families, survivors of retired service members and qualified former spouses. Our contract for health care delivery services concluded at the end of 2024.\n5\nTable of Contents\n•\nCorporate Management Company. \nEach of our health plans contracts with our corporate management company to provide certain functions required to manage the health plan including, but not limited to, salaries and wages for personnel, rent, utilities, population health management, provider contracting, compliance, member services, claims processing, information technology, cash management, finance and accounting and other services.\nOUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS\nOur approach is based on the following key competitive strengths: \n•\nFocus and Experience\n. Centene was established as a Medicaid company, anchored around long-lasting, trusted relationships, with a continual focus on low-income populations. Since our founding more than 40 years ago, we have forged new paths developing innovative solutions and addressing the evolving needs of our members, earning Centene an important seat at the table and a powerful voice to shape the conversation at the state and federal level. We have deliberately increased our market density by expanding to serve other low-income and medically complex populations and, as a result, we are now the largest Medicaid health insurer and Marketplace carrier in the country with an established Medicare presence. As states increasingly move to integrate care for individuals who are dually eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare, our expertise uniquely positions us to serve this population of more than 12 million beneficiaries nationwide. We are positioned at the nexus of affordability and choice, ready to meet the needs of consumers who increasingly seek innovative products like ICHRAs.\n•\nLocal Approach\n. Our local approach to delivering healthcare enables us to meet members and providers in the communities where they are to facilitate member access to high-quality, culturally sensitive healthcare services. Our programs and services are tailored to the unique individuals we serve and include a broad range of initiatives to address social drivers of health such as food insecurity, housing instability, unemployment and access to transportation, which contribute to health disparities among underserved communities. With local leadership owning all three lines of business, we are able to translate local best practices from our Medicaid business into product development, distribution, network and pricing decisions we make for our Marketplace and Medicare businesses. We know what our customers will value because we live and work alongside them every day.\n•\nPartnerships\n. Centene's partnership mindset allows us to design solutions for our members that integrate the most relevant, most local and most innovative capabilities in an agile and capital-efficient way. Partnership has become both a strategy and discipline: finding, measuring and maintaining the best partners over time. Instead of owning providers, we identify the best providers for our members, investing in data and engagement models that will support them in delivering health outcomes. For example, we entered into a partnership with the National Association of Community Health Centers to enhance value-based care adoption, further strengthening Community Health Centers' ability to deliver high-quality, patient-centered care and improve maternal child health outcomes.\n•\nPeople. \nThrough an intentional focus on building a One CenTeam culture, we have elevated and unleashed the power of 60,500 team members who uniquely understand how to serve our members and are committed to our mission of transforming the health of the communities we serve, one person at a time.\n6\nTable of Contents\nBenefits to Customers\nWe feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while improving the affordability of healthcare, and from our specialized programs with state governments.\nThe following are among the benefits we provide to our government partners, providers and members:\n•\nAccurate and timely claims payments. \nWe are committed to ensuring that our information systems and claims payment systems meet or exceed state requirements. We continuously improve our claims processing strategies, expertise, configuration and tools to achieve operational excellence, including timely payments to our providers.\n•\nCare management for complex populations. \nThrough our experience with Medicaid populations and long-time presence in states with experience in long-term care for children and adolescents in the foster care system, we have developed care management, service coordination and crisis prevention/response programs that improve healthcare outcomes through decreasing preventable emergency department utilization and improving access to primary care and behavioral health intervention.\n•\nCommitment to quality and improved health outcomes. \nWe demonstrate this through obtaining health plan accreditations, such as National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), which assesses the effectiveness of our structure and operational processes, clinical quality and member satisfaction. We have developed care coordination, case management and clinical programs focused on key prevention and chronic conditions. Additionally, we have launched a multi-year plan to improve quality across the enterprise with a strong focus on enhanced patient experience and access to care, which lays the foundation for strong quality ratings in the future, including Medicare Star ratings and Marketplace Quality Rating System (QRS).\n•\nCommunity-specific healthcare programs and a focus on addressing healthcare gaps. \nOur expertise in government-sponsored programs has helped us establish and maintain strong relationships with community-based organizations, local providers, as well as our state and federal partners. Our health plans develop tailored, local programs and campaigns to support members through solutions that promote whole-person care and enhance healthcare for all.\n•\nData-driven approach to improve health outcomes. \nWe have employed an investment strategy designed to increase our capability to collect and analyze data and insights. We gather data from multiple sources including medical, vision and behavioral health claims and encounter data, pharmacy data, dental vendor claims and authorization data. We use this data to track utilization trends, identify health disparities, monitor quality of care and evaluate the effectiveness of our programs. Through these analyses, we identify and implement interventions that improve health outcomes, advance health equity and ensure members receive timely, appropriate services. The value and accuracy in the data we collect is important in demonstrating an auditable program for federal and state agencies.\n•\nMember programs and services\n. Our comprehensive set of programs and services help members achieve whole-person health while supporting the overall goals of the government program. Covered healthcare benefits vary from customer to customer but cover a wide range of services, including transportation assistance, provision of durable medical equipment, behavioral health and substance use disorder services, 24-hour nurse advice line, social work services and telehealth services.\n•\nValue-based arrangements. \nOur health plans offer a combination of value-based contracting models, including quality incentives and risk arrangements, that address the continuum of whole-person care. We believe value-based collaboration with providers leads to improved health outcomes, reduced costs and better member and provider experiences.\n7\nTable of Contents\nProviders\nFor each of our service areas, we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians, hospitals, behavioral health practitioners and ancillary providers. Our network of primary care physicians is a critical component of care delivery, healthcare affordability, and the attraction and retention of new members. Primary care physicians include family and general practitioners, pediatricians and internal medicine physicians. Specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by primary care physicians. Specialty care physicians include a wide array of provider types including, but not limited to, orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists and otolaryngologists. We also build robust networks of mental health providers, such as psychiatrists, social workers, substance abuse disorder facilities, and inpatient behavioral health facilities. We also contract with providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy, home healthcare, diagnostic laboratory tests, x-ray examinations, ambulance services and durable medical equipment.\nOur health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers. Our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals are usually for a term of one to three years and usually renew automatically for successive one-year terms, but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice. In the absence of a contract, we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels and guidelines, depending on the product (for example, Medicaid or Medicare). We pay providers under a variety of methods, including fee-for-service, capitation arrangements and value-based arrangements.\n•\nUnder our fee-for-service contracts with providers, we pay a negotiated fee for covered services, which may include a case rate or fee-for service. This model is characterized as having no financial risk for the provider. \n•\nUnder our capitated contracts, providers can be paid a set amount for their services as outlined in their respective provider agreements, usually on a per member per month basis and sometimes including different rates depending on the age of the population.\n•\nUnder value-based arrangements, providers can be paid under either a capitated or fee-for-service model. The arrangement, however, contains provisions for additional payments to the providers or reimbursement from the providers based on their performance against quality and other measures. We are committed to value-based contracting, upside and downside risk, assigning members to the highest quality providers and capitation. This is done in partnership with our providers to increase quality outcomes and overall member satisfaction. We anticipate our membership in upside and downside risk arrangements will continue to grow.\nThe continuum of value-based contracting includes the following models: pay-for-performance, shared savings, shared risk and full risk. We often start our provider relationships in a pay-for-performance model, in which providers are reimbursed for the fair market value of services provided. Providers benefit from this model as it gives complete transparency and clarity on actions that earn incentives. \nWe then transition to a risk-sharing model, in which providers are reimbursed based on the total cost of care. As we advance along this continuum, it strengthens our partnerships with our providers, enabling the delivery of high-quality care. We believe having the strongest provider partners who know how to operate well in a value-based model and who can help us drive positive outcomes for our members and good member experience is more important than owning providers, which occurs on an exception basis. Prioritizing partnership over ownership allows us to be agile and capital-efficient, focusing our resources on what we do best.\nWe work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing actionable financial and utilization information, physician and patient educational programs and disease and population health management programs. Our programs are also designed to help physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers.\nWe believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets. Our contracted physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs, optimizing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members, while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers. This approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention which, in turn, has helped to increase our membership base. \n8\nTable of Contents\nThe following are among the services we provide to support physicians:\n•\nProvider Engagement Performance Tools and Processes\n can lead to measurable improvements in quality and health outcomes, healthcare costs and member satisfaction. High-quality provider support and service levels are important as our key customers are increasingly using performance-based measures to select and pay health plans. We have a suite of network performance tools for use by physicians and other providers which monitor the outcomes and care gaps of their individual patient panels. Provider Engagement and Quality teams meet with the providers to review their performance issues and recommend strategies for improvements in their patient panel outcome, including disease management and quality initiatives. Our tools also allow the physician and others to see where they stand within their value-based contract.\n•\nOur Integrated Care Model \nis member-centric and managed by one care manager assigned to a member who looks at the care for the member in a holistic manner. This single care manager will coordinate all care for that member including behavioral health, medical health and home-based primary care in accordance with an individualized, integrated care plan. This care manager also coordinates meetings with the member's integrated care team to assess and alter the care plan as needed. This results in better clinical outcomes and improved member satisfaction.\n•\nThe Provider Portal\n delivers claims and eligibility information, prior authorization submissions and status, member panels, care gaps, patient analytics and provider analytics to contracted providers to drive provider engagement and improve patient outcomes. Data and reporting are delivered via a secure, user-friendly web-based provider portal.\nOur contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members and population health management programs, which assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic diseases.\nQuality Improvement\nQuality improvement is foundational for our organization. Our commitment to achieving better health outcomes for our members has led to recent investments in key initiatives involving people, processes, technology and partner management.\nThrough these initiatives, we have:\n•\ncentralized the oversight of core quality processes and programs, including the implementation of real-time operational dashboards to track numerous quality performance metrics;\n•\ninvested in new technology to enhance our access to clinical data on gaps in care, committed to integrating our numerous quality platforms into a single unified workflow and developed advanced analytics to more efficiently and effectively target our member engagement efforts for maximum impact on access, quality and member satisfaction;\n•\nincreased focus on member engagement, including tripling the capacity of our member outreach services to encourage active participation with their primary care physicians and other members of their care team and overhauling our onboarding process to focus on quality from the very first member touchpoint for Medicare; and\n•\nprioritized strengthening relationships with providers to improve access and quality of care for our members; an essential strategy on this front is increasing our value-based provider engagements as those enhanced partnerships have proven to drive higher quality care. We also continue to promote local participation in physician quality improvement committees chaired by local physician leaders, which ensures clinical oversight and is critical to the success of clinical quality improvement programs.\nWe believe these initiatives will improve members' overall health and healthcare experience and help us achieve stronger quality scores overall, such as Medicare Star ratings and Marketplace QRS.\nCMS developed the Medicare Advantage Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers choose among competing plans, awarding between 1.0 and 5.0 Stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance on composite measures of quality. The parent organization Star rating is used for new Medicare Advantage contracts while existing contracts follow their individual Star ratings to determine bonus payments.\n9\nTable of Contents\nPlans receive additional Medicare revenue related to the achievement of higher Star ratings that can be used to offer more attractive benefit packages to members and/or achieve higher profit margins. In addition, plans with Star ratings of 5.0 are eligible for year-round open enrollment, whereas plans with lower Star ratings have more restrictions on enrollment criteria and timing. Part C or Part D Medicare plans with Star ratings of fewer than three stars for three consecutive years are denoted as \"low performing\" plans on the CMS website and in the CMS \"Medicare and You\" handbook. In addition, CMS has the authority to terminate the Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts for plans rated below three Stars for three consecutive years for any Part (C or D). As a result, plans that achieve higher Star ratings may have a competitive advantage over plans with lower Star ratings.\nAs further validation of our quality objectives, we pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality. NCQA Health Plan programs provide unbiased, third-party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality metrics including Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). We pursue and achieve accreditation in the majority of states where we currently have health plan operations. We also verify the credentials and backgrounds of our partner providers using standards supported by NCQA to ensure the quality of our networks.\nAccreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members. The majority of state Medicaid programs also have specific quality measures that drive our clinical quality improvement efforts. Performance is monitored by health plan quality improvement committees and our corporate population health management and quality improvement teams.\nWe remain committed to our quality initiatives and continue to focus on investments that we expect to translate into value over the next few years.\nETHICS AND COMPLIANCE\nOur Ethics and Compliance program assists the organization in developing effective internal controls that promote the prevention, detection and correction of fraud, waste and abuse and instances of conduct that do not conform to federal and state law, private payor healthcare program requirements or our ethics and business policies. Responsibilities also include the ongoing maintenance of our privacy program and oversight of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as it pertains to us and our business units from a compliance, business and technical perspective.\nThree standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines, the CMS Chapter Guidance, and the Compliance Program Guidance series issued by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General. Our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by these authorities.\nThese key components are:\n•\nwritten standards of conduct; \n•\ndesignation of compliance officers and compliance committees;\n•\neffective training and education;\n•\neffective lines for reporting and communication;\n•\nenforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary guidelines and actions;\n•\ninternal monitoring and auditing; and\n•\nprompt response to detected offenses and development of corrective action plans. \nThe goal of our program is to build a culture of integrity, ethics and compliance, which is assessed periodically to measure engagement and effectiveness. Our Ethics and Compliance intranet site, accessible to all team members, links to our Code of Conduct and guidance for team members to assist them in reporting concerns or asking questions. Our Ethics and Compliance Helpline is a toll-free number and web-based reporting tool operated by a third-party independent of the Company and allows team members or other persons to anonymously report suspected incidents of misconduct, fraud, waste, abuse or other compliance violations, concerns or questions. Furthermore, our Board of Directors' Audit and Compliance Committee reviews ethics and compliance report data quarterly.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\nOur steadfast commitment to the health and social well-being of our communities, fostering a healthy environment and our culture of sound and ethical corporate governance, extends far beyond individual programs or initiatives. We provide access to high-quality healthcare, innovative programs and a wide range of health solutions that help people live healthier lives. Our mission is to transform the health of the communities we serve, one person at a time. Our Corporate Sustainability Framework (the Framework) is comprised of areas of focus core to our mission, our strategy and to delivering positive impact and long-term value to our stakeholders. The Framework highlights our commitment to healthy individuals and healthy communities and builds upon our long history of identifying and removing barriers to health. Implementation of the Framework is overseen by the Board of Directors' Governance Committee and corporate sustainability initiatives throughout the organization are driven by a cross-functional network of executives.\nAnnually, we issue a corporate sustainability report to communicate the value of our efforts, a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Index report outlining our governance structure, strategy, risks, opportunities and metrics related to managing climate change, and a SASB Index report aligned with the SASB Managed Care standards maintained by the International Sustainability Standards Board providing corporate sustainability disclosures to our stakeholders. The Framework enables us to communicate impact and progress on corporate sustainability matters important to our stakeholders and aligned with our business strategy and long-term plans. Corporate sustainability financial reporting disclosures are overseen by the Board of Directors' Audit and Compliance Committee. Our corporate sustainability initiatives and commitments enable us to build healthier communities, empower health, foster a healthy environment and drive business accountability. Interested parties can find our corporate sustainability-related reports within the Investors section of our website, the URL of which is https://investors.centene.com/sustainability. \nPlease note: Nothing on our website, including our corporate sustainability reports or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nCOMPETITION\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes, including business consolidations, new strategic alliances, market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform both at the federal and state level. This includes, but is not limited to, the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading \"Regulation.\" In addition, changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape. \nWe compete with other MCOs, specialty companies and other non-traditional competitors to acquire and retain state, county, federal and commercial contracts. Before granting a contract, state and federal government agencies consider many competitive factors, including but not limited to, quality of care, access to care through comprehensive provider networks, reducing administrative burden for providers and members, financial condition, stability and resources, previous experience and performance and local investments and offerings.\nWe also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members. People who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered, ease of access to services, a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits. We believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered, size and quality of provider network, quality of service, quality ratings, responsiveness to customer demands, financial stability, comprehensiveness of coverage, diversity of product offerings, market presence and reputation.\nWe also compete with other MCOs in establishing provider networks. When contracting with various health plans, we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume, reimbursement rates, provider experience, value-based payment programs, speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities. See \"Risk Factors - \nCompetition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve\n.\n\"\n \nThe relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market, including by geography and by product. We believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants.\n11\nTable of Contents\nREGULATION\nOur operations are comprehensively regulated at the local, state and federal levels. Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. States have implemented National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model laws and regulations, requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. States have adopted these or similar measures to enhance oversight relating to corporate governance and internal controls of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators.\nRegulatory agencies have substantial discretion to issue regulations and to interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically, including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal levels. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under new administrations remains uncertain.\nOur regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as HMOs, preferred provider organizations (PPOs), third-party administrators (TPAs), utilization review organizations, pharmacies, direct care providers and/or insurance companies in their respective states. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the relevant health and/or human services departments, Medicaid agencies, boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers, departments of insurance, and departments of health that oversee the activities of MCOs and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees.\nThe process for obtaining authorization to operate as an MCO, health insurance plan, PDP, pharmacy or provider organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plan's organizational structure, financial resources, utilization review, quality assurance programs, billing protocols, complaint procedures, provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions. For example, under state MCO statutes and insurance laws, our health plan subsidiaries, as well as companies within our Other segment, must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements, such as deposit and surplus requirements. Insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other MCO businesses and the payment of dividends, as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds. Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements. In addition, each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes, including, without limitation, changes to existing offerings, the development of new product offerings, certain organizational restructurings and, in some states, the expansion of service areas. \nStates have adopted a number of laws and regulations that may affect our business and results of operations. These laws and regulations, in certain states, include:\n•\npremium taxes or similar assessments imposed on us;\n•\nstringent prompt payment laws requiring us to pay claims within a specified period of time;\n•\nmandated coverage of specific drugs or services;\n•\nstate-specific medical loss ratios that may be more stringent than federal requirements;\n•\ndisclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures; and\n•\nprograms to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups.\nWe are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states' insurance departments reports describing their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, depending on the size and nature of the transaction, various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.\n12\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, the holding company regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval or an exemption, no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company that controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would \"control\" the insurance holding company. \"Control\" is generally defined in state insurance laws as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of a company. \nPPO laws and regulations also vary by state and cover all or most of the subject areas referred to above.\nOur pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state-controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances.\nOur healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located. In addition, they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board, board of nursing or other applicable entity. Furthermore, they must not be excluded from participation at either the state or federal levels. Our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environments are safe to provide care.\nFederal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government, such as Medicaid and Medicare programs. Our Medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies. Federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs. Federal law permits the federal government to oversee and, in some cases, to enact, regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs. Medicare is administered at the federal level by CMS. Comprehensive legislation, specifically Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, governs our Medicare program. In addition, our Medicare contracts are subject to regulation by CMS. CMS has the right to audit Medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with CMS contracts and regulations. \nThe ACA transformed the U.S. healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives. Some of the ACA's most significant provisions include the imposition of fees, assessments and taxes; the establishment of federally-facilitated and state-based Health Insurance Marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage; the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers; and optional Medicaid Expansion. State and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the ACA, and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business. For a further discussion of the ACA, see \"Risk Factors - \nSignificant changes or judicial challenges to the ACA and the other government-sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\"\nWe must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. For example, money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment. To ensure compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity. A violation of specific laws and regulations by us and/or our agents could result in, among other things, the imposition of fines and penalties on us, changes to our business practices, the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. \n13\nTable of Contents\nState and Federal Businesses; Contracts\nIn addition to being a licensed insurance company or HMO, in order to be a Medicaid MCO in each of the states in which we operate, we generally must operate under a contract with the state's Medicaid agency. States generally either use a formal request for proposal process, reviewing a number of bidders, or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program. Under these state Medicaid program contracts, we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis. These rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state. In addition, several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain Medicare Advantage D-SNPs, which are regulated by CMS and the state Medicaid agency, for dual-eligible individuals within the state.\nWe provide Medicare Advantage, PDPs, D-SNPs and MMPs pursuant to contracts with CMS and subject to federal regulation regarding the award, administration and performance of such contracts. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts, other CMS regulations, and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries under these contracts.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we operated in 29 states under federally-facilitated Marketplace contracts with CMS and state-based exchanges. We also operate under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Medical Services and the Arkansas Insurance Department to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that Arkansas has adopted (referred to as AR Health and Opportunity for Me program).\nOur government contracts have included government-sponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the TRICARE program and certain other healthcare-related government contracts. Our contract for health care delivery services through the TRICARE program concluded at the end of 2024.\nOur state and federal contracts and the legal and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth requirements for operating, including provisions relating to:\n•\neligibility, enrollment and dis-enrollment processes;\n•\ncovered services;\n•\neligible providers;\n•\nsubcontractors;\n•\nrecord-keeping and record retention;\n•\nperiodic financial and informational reporting;\n•\nquality assurance;\n•\naccreditation;\n•\nhealth education and wellness and prevention programs;\n•\ntimeliness of claims payment;\n•\nfinancial standards;\n•\nsafeguarding of member information;\n•\nfraud, waste and abuse detection and reporting;\n•\ngrievance procedures; \n•\nuse and compensation of brokers; and\n•\norganization and administrative systems.\nA health plan or individual health insurance provider's compliance with these requirements is subject to significant monitoring by state regulators and by CMS, including monthly, quarterly and annual reporting, all of which are generally state-specific. A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third-party reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan. A health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies, including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports.\nOur health plans operate through individual state contracts, generally with an initial term of one to five years. The contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the state's reprocurement process. The contracts generally are subject to termination for cause, an event of default or lack of funding, among other things.\nOur federally-facilitated Marketplace contracts and state-based exchanges are renewable on an annual basis.\n14\nTable of Contents\nOther Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws\nInvestigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud, waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement agencies. These efforts span multiple products, including Medicare, Medicaid, Health Insurance Marketplace and commercial plans. Pertinent fraud, waste and abuse laws include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Many states have their own statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act. A plan or provider may engage in other activities that violate fraud, waste and abuse laws, such as paying or receiving kickbacks or other inducements for the referral of members or coverage of products (such as prescription drugs), billing for unnecessary medical services or making false or misleading sales-related representations.\nOur program integrity efforts aim to detect, prevent and correct fraud, waste and abuse. In addition to following up on leads from members, providers and our own team members, we use data analytics to identify suspicious activity and, as appropriate, will deny improperly billed claims, recover improperly made payments and make referrals to regulatory entities and law enforcement for further review. The laws and regulations relating to fraud, waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans, PDPs and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly. Compliance with these laws may require substantial resources. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our fraud, waste and abuse detection methods. While we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing, we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment.\nPrivacy Regulations\nWe are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and rules regarding the use, security and disclosure of protected health information, personal information and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle. Such laws and rules include, without limitation, HIPAA, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and state privacy and security laws such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and the California Online Privacy Protection Act. Privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation, regulations or administrative interpretation. A variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and other state regulators.\nHIPAA is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage, simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information. Among the requirements of HIPAA are the Administrative Simplification provisions which include: standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions (Transactions Standards); requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information (Privacy Rule); and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained, stored or transmitted in electronic format (Security Rule). The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act amended certain provisions of HIPAA and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates. HITECH also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach, provided enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations and granted enforcement authority to states' Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office for Civil Rights. The HIPAA Omnibus Rule further enhanced the changes under the HITECH Acts and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 which clarified that genetic information is protected under HIPAA and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes. These regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non-compliance. The preemption provisions of HIPAA provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements. \nThe Privacy and Security Rules and HITECH/Omnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates. \nThe Security Rule requires healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored, maintained or transmitted. The HITECH Act and Omnibus Rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached. In addition, there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for, among other things, private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe requirements of the Transactions Standards apply to certain healthcare-related transactions conducted using \"electronic media.\" Since \"electronic media\" is defined broadly to include \"transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data, magnetic tape, disk or compact disk media,\" many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted. Under HIPAA, health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format. Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements. The Transactions Standards were modified in October 2015 with the implementation of the ICD-10 coding system.\nIn addition, we process and maintain personal card data, particularly in connection with our Marketplace business. As a result, we must maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit, debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 60,500 team members. Our team members are guided by our mission-driven culture. Our culture values of accountability, courage, curiosity, trust and service guide our workforce and foster high-performing teams that serve our customers and key stakeholders each day while delivering against our long-term strategic goals. We intentionally attract, develop and retain top talent who bring a broad range of voices and experiences, passion and vision to help us transform the health of the communities we serve.\nCompensation and Other Benefits\nOur overall compensation philosophy is to pay for performance by linking the achievement of both Company and individual goals to total compensation. We offer benefits to our team members to help them achieve optimum work-life balance and meet their needs as well as the needs of their families. In addition to traditional healthcare benefits, we also offer various wellness programs, an employee assistance program, tuition reimbursement/educational assistance, a 401(k) retirement plan, as well as programs for family support such as adoption assistance, parental leave and caregiver leave. Our parental leave offers six weeks of fully compensated time for caregivers with an additional eight weeks for mothers, providing up to 14 weeks of fully compensated maternity leave. In addition, we offer paid community volunteer time to encourage our team members to participate in volunteer programs and support local communities.\nTalent Acquisition and Development\nThrough our robust talent infrastructure, we continue working to deepen and prepare our talent bench and workforce, which is instrumental to executing our long-term business strategy. Our talent advisors and hiring leaders recruit from across the country to develop a workforce possessing outstanding capabilities and a wide range of perspectives and lived experiences. We are committed to developing a skill-rich workforce who can thrive in the evolving world of work, enabling our organization to further accelerate growth, inclusivity and innovation. Through Centene University, accessible to our team members, we have designed learning and development at scale, using new digital tools, real-time virtual learnings and customized leadership development programs in a modern learning environment. In addition to building new workforce skills, we utilize our ongoing enterprise talent reviews, succession planning, career development planning and comprehensive workforce analytics to provide insights to senior leaders to inform actions and drive intentional talent results.\nModernized and Connected Workforce\nWe have adopted a modern work environment with the majority of our team members leveraging remote and hybrid work arrangements, allowing them to do their best work in the way they work best. We are intentional in our efforts to foster a collaborative and engaging work environment, including forums for people leaders, robust weekly communications for all team members, and virtual all-employee meetings. Additionally, we have a wide range of Centene Professional Networks. Open to all employees, these voluntary, employee-led groups provide professional connections and leadership opportunities for all team members and drive impact by supporting the attraction, development and retention of the best talent at all levels.\n16\nTable of Contents\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our executive officers, including their ages, at February 14, 2025:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nSarah M.

The Company takes a local approach – with local brands and local teams – to provide fully integrated, high-quality and cost-effective services to government-sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. Centene offers affordable and high-quality products to more than 1 in 15 individuals across the nation, including Medicaid and Medicare members (including Medicare Prescription Drug Plans) as well as individuals and families served by the Health Insurance Marketplace.\nWe provide access to high-quality healthcare, innovative programs and a wide range of health solutions that help families and individuals get well, stay well and be well. Our uniquely local approach – with local brands and local teams who live in, care about and directly influence the communities they serve – is a key differentiator in our ability to provide access to quality care to our members. Centene treats the whole person, an approach that is delivered locally and backed by the scale of Centene's expertise, data and resources. Through this approach and our commitment to sustainable partnerships, we work with local community organizations to realize our mission of transforming the health of the communities we serve, one person at a time.\nOur record of organic growth and strategic acquisitions have given us the size, scale and privilege of providing local high-quality and affordable health care to more than 28.6 million Americans. As of December 31, 2024, we were the largest Medicaid health insurer in the country, serving more than 13 million Medicaid recipients in 30 states. We were the largest Marketplace carrier, serving 4.4 million members across 29 states, served 1.1 million Medicare Advantage members across 37 states and were the largest stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) provider serving 6.9 million members in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Consistent with our strategy, we have reduced our Medicare Advantage footprint to 32 states as of January 1, 2025.\nGeneral\nOur results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. We measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. The health benefits ratio (HBR) represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided. The SG&A expense ratio represents SG&A costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, excluding premium taxes separately billed.\nDivestitures\nIn November 2022, we divested our ownership stakes in our Spanish and Central European businesses and as a result recorded an impairment charge of $163 million, or $140 million after-tax. During 2023, we recognized an additional loss on sale of $13 million, or $10 million after-tax.\nIn December 2022, we completed the divestiture of Magellan Rx for $1.3 billion and recognized a gain of $269 million, or $99 million after-tax. During 2023, we recorded a reduction to the previously reported gain of $22 million, or $10 million after-tax, due to the finalization of working capital adjustments.\nIn January 2023, we sold Magellan Specialty Health for $646 million in cash and stock, including an estimated working capital adjustment, and recognized a gain of $79 million, or $63 million after-tax. During 2024, we recorded an additional gain on sale of $83 million for achievement of contingent consideration related to the sale and finalization of working capital adjustments.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIn January 2023, we also completed the divestitures of Centurion and HealthSmart and recorded impairments of $259 million ($181 million after-tax) and $36 million ($27 million after-tax), respectively, in 2022. During 2023, we recognized a gain of $15 million, or $10 million after-tax, on the divestiture of the Centurion business reflecting additional proceeds for contingent consideration, partially offset by net working capital adjustments.\nIn June 2023, we completed the divestiture of our majority stake in Apixio and recognized a gain of $93 million, or $67 million after-tax.\nIn December 2023, we completed the divestiture of Operose Health Group (Operose Health) and recognized an impairment of $140 million, or $128 million after-tax.\nIn January 2024, we completed the divestiture of Circle Health Group (Circle Health) for $931 million. Upon closing the divestiture, we settled the foreign currency swap associated with the divestiture and recorded a corresponding gain of $20 million.\nIn October 2024, we completed the divestiture of Collaborative Health Systems (CHS) and recognized a pre-tax gain of $17 million, or $13 million after-tax.\nThe above-noted divestitures are drivers of certain year-over-year variances discussed throughout this section.\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nThe United States government, policymakers and healthcare experts continue to discuss and debate various elements of the United States healthcare model. We remain focused on the promise of delivering access to high-quality, affordable healthcare to all of our members and believe we are well positioned to meet the needs of the changing healthcare landscape.\nThe American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), enacted in March 2021, initially enhanced eligibility for the premium tax credit for enrollees in the Health Insurance Marketplace. The enhanced eligibility extended by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in August 2022, expires at the end of 2025. We continue to advocate for legislation and regulations aimed at leveraging Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplace to maintain health insurance coverage and affordability for consumers.\nThe IRA significantly changes Medicare PDPs in 2025, most notably by eliminating the coverage gap and capping members' annual out-of-pocket cost at $2,000 in order to provide more predictable and affordable prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The IRA changes effective for 2025 result in a meaningful shift in cost-sharing responsibilities between members, drug companies, CMS, and PDPs and will result in a significant increase in our premiums in consideration for our PDPs responsibility for a larger portion of total Part D benefit costs. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business as it relates to Medicaid eligibility changes. From the onset of the public health emergency (PHE) through March 2023, our Medicaid membership increased by 3.6 million members (excluding new states North Carolina and Delaware and various state product expansions or managed care organization changes). Since March 31, 2023, redeterminations are the primary driver of our Medicaid membership decline. While some states may still be concluding the redetermination process for certain populations of members, we anticipate that any remaining reductions will be limited as the majority of states have substantially completed their unwinding processes as of December 2024. We continue to work with our state partners to match rates to acuity post-redeterminations.\nIn addition, newly finalized Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations will require beneficiaries dually enrolled in Medicare and in a Medicaid Managed Care Plan to receive integrated care through the Medicaid company's Medicare Advantage Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs) beginning in 2030, with certain restrictions beginning in 2027. However, some states have already moved or are planning to exclusively align dual-eligible enrollment under an aligned D-SNP before this timeframe. We believe we are positioned well given our overlapping Medicaid and Medicare Advantage footprints and are committed to navigating evolving regulations.\nWe also closely monitor state legislation across our markets and are advocating for and seeing adoption of coverage expansions for Medicaid populations (e.g., North Carolina), postpartum (now in effect for 48 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands), foster care children, among others, as well as mitigating adverse legislation addressing pharmacy, prior authorization and other issues. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 outlined key coverage expansion provisions, which went into effect in January 2024, requiring states to provide 12 months of continuous coverage for children under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n44\nTable of Contents\nWe have four decades of experience, spanning seven presidents from both sides of the aisle, in delivering high-quality healthcare services on behalf of states and the federal government to under-insured and uninsured families, commercial organizations. This expertise has allowed us to deliver cost-effective services to our government partners and our members. With trends in the personalization of healthcare technology, we continue the use of data and analytics to improve the provider and member experience.

The decrease in Star quality ratings was driven by the expiration of certain disaster relief provisions as well as deterioration in select metrics. As a result of this impact, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. We anticipate that the 2025 Plan year will operate at a loss driven primarily by Star ratings; accordingly, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $92 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nCommercial\n•\nIn 2024, our Health Insurance Marketplace product, Ambetter Health expanded into Delaware.

The increases were partially offset by lower Medicaid membership primarily due to redeterminations and divestitures in the Other segment.\nOperating Expenses\nMedical Costs/HBR\nThe HBR for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 88.3%, compared to 87.7% in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher acuity in Medicaid resulting from the redetermination process as we continue to work with states to match rates with acuity. The increase was also driven by Medicare Star rating impacts. The increases were partially offset by Marketplace membership growth and improved margin through strong 2024 product design and execution, outperformance in Marketplace risk adjustment for the 2023 benefit year as well as the Marketplace cost sharing reduction (CSR) settlement related to prior years. The 2024 HBR was also favorably impacted by the decrease in the Medicare Advantage premium deficiency reserve-related expenses compared to 2023.\nCost of Services \nCost of services decreased by $835 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 85.2%, compared to 79.9% in 2023. The decrease in expense and increase in the ratio were primarily driven by the divestiture of Circle Health, which operated at a lower cost of service ratio.\nSelling, General & Administrative Expenses\nThe SG&A expense ratio was 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in the adjusted SG&A expense ratio was primarily driven by the divestiture of Circle Health, which operated at a higher SG&A expense ratio, lower Medicare SG&A, and continued leveraging of expenses over higher revenues. The decrease was partially offset by growth in the Marketplace business, which operates at a meaningfully higher SG&A expense ratio as compared to Medicaid.\nImpairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded total impairment charges of $13 million driven by Health Net Federal Services property, software and equipment related to the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract that was no longer recoverable following the 2024 final ruling.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded total impairment charges of $529 million, including a $292 million charge related to assets associated with the divestiture of Circle Health, a $140 million charge related to the Operose Health divestiture and additional impairments of $97 million related to our real estate optimization initiative.\n52\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions): \n \n2024\n2023\nInvestment and other income\n$\n1,784 \n$\n1,393 \nInterest expense\n(702)\n(725)\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n1,082 \n$\n668 \nInvestment and other income. \nInvestment and other income increased by $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, driven by higher interest rates on larger investment balances. The year ended December 31, 2024 also included net gains on divestitures described above, partially offset by a private equity investment reduction. The year ended December 31, 2023 included net gains on divestitures described above, partially offset by a realized loss on the sale of investments from rebalancing a portion of our portfolio with a focus on higher interest rate investments.\nInterest expense. \nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $702 million compared to $725 million for the corresponding period in 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an income tax expense of $963 million on pre-tax earnings of $4.3 billion, or an effective tax rate of 22.6%. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 reflects tax effects of the Circle Health divestiture, which closed during the first quarter, settlements with tax authorities and valuation allowance releases. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 23.8%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $899 million on pre-tax earnings of $3.6 billion, or an effective tax rate of 25.0%. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects the tax effects of the distribution of long-term stock awards to the estate of the Company's former CEO, divestiture gains and losses, lower state taxes as well as the then pending divestiture of Circle Health. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 24.9%.\n53\nTable of Contents\nSegment Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results by segment for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):\n \n2024\n2023\n% Change 2023-2024\nTotal Revenues\n \n \n \nMedicaid\n$\n101,417 \n$\n100,759 \n1 \n%\nMedicare\n23,032 \n22,261 \n3 \n%\nCommercial\n33,702 \n24,845 \n36 \n%\nOther\n4,920 \n6,134 \n(20)\n%\nConsolidated Total\n$\n163,071 \n$\n153,999 \n6 \n%\nGross Margin \n(1)\nMedicaid\n$\n6,246 \n$\n8,641 \n(28)\n%\nMedicare\n2,595 \n2,867 \n(9)\n%\nCommercial\n7,663 \n5,029 \n52 \n%\nOther\n565 \n1,100 \n(49)\n%\nConsolidated Total\n$\n17,069 \n$\n17,637 \n(3)\n%\n(1)\nGross margin represents premium and service revenues less medical costs and cost of services.\nMedicaid\nTotal revenues increased 1% in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Gross margin decreased $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by increased premium tax revenue and rate increases, partially offset by lower membership primarily due to redeterminations. Gross margin decreased primarily due to lower overall membership as a result of the redetermination process, coupled with higher acuity post-redeterminations as we continue to work with our state partners to match rates to the changes in acuity.\nMedicare\nTotal revenues increased 3% in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily driven by increased PDP membership of 50%, partially offset by lower Medicare Advantage membership. Gross margin decreased $272 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023 driven primarily by lower Medicare Advantage revenue resulting from the Star quality ratings impact and lower membership discussed above. Gross margin in 2024 was favorably impacted by the decrease in the Medicare Advantage premium deficiency reserve-related expenses compared to 2023 and growth and performance in the PDP business.\nCommercial\nTotal revenues increased 36% in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Gross margin increased $2.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The increases were primarily driven by 12% membership growth in the Marketplace business along with improved margin through strong 2024 product design and execution as well as outperformance in Marketplace risk adjustment for the 2023 benefit year and the Marketplace CSR settlement related to prior years.\nOther\nTotal revenues decreased 20% in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Gross margin decreased $535 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The decreases were primarily due to divestitures.\n54\nTable of Contents\n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table is a condensed schedule of cash flows used in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources ($ in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n154 \n$\n8,053 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(1,052)\n(1,191)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(2,406)\n(1,658)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n8 \n(32)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(3,296)\n$\n5,172 \nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNormal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. In 2024, operating activities provided cash of $154 million compared to providing cash of $8.1 billion in 2023. Cash flows provided by operations in 2024 was primarily driven by net earnings, almost entirely offset by an increase in pharmacy receivables driven by pharmacy rebate remittance timing associated with our transition to a new third-party PBM in January 2024, a decrease in net risk adjustment payables and higher state premium receivables for recent rate increases.\nCash flows provided by operations in 2023 were primarily driven by net earnings, an increase in risk adjustment payable for Marketplace and the timing of pass-through payments.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities used cash of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $1.2 billion in 2023. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2024 and 2023 primarily consisted of net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries (including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments) and capital expenditures, partially offset by divestiture proceeds.\nWe spent $644 million and $799 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on capital expenditures primarily for system enhancements and computer hardware.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with a weighted average duration of 3.4 years. We had unregulated cash and investments of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, we had unregulated cash and investments of $1.0 billion, the majority of which was utilized in January 2024 to complete planned pass-through payments. Unregulated cash and investments include private equity investments and company owned life insurance contracts.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nFinancing activities used cash of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to using cash of $1.7 billion in the comparable period in 2023. Financing activities in 2024 were driven by stock repurchases of $3.1 billion, which included $3.0 billion under the stock repurchase program and $114 million of repurchases related to income tax withholding upon the vesting of previously awarded stock grants, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt.\nIn 2023, financing activities were driven by stock repurchases of $1.6 billion.\n55\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Metrics\nWe have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized up to a cumulative total of $10.0 billion of repurchases under the program. \nIn 2024, we repurchased a total of 42.0 million shares of common stock for $3.0 billion under the stock repurchase program, primarily funded through divestiture proceeds and free cash flow generated from operations. We have $2.2 billion remaining under the program as of December 31, 2024. No duration has been placed on the repurchase program. We reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. Refer to Note 12. \nStockholders' Equity\n for further information on stock repurchases.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of $15.7 billion of senior notes issued and outstanding. The indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain limited restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nAs part of our capital allocation strategy, we may decide to repurchase debt or raise capital through the issuance of debt in the form of senior notes. In 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion senior note debt repurchase program. No repurchases were made during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there was $700 million available under the senior note debt repurchase program. Refer to Note 10.\n Debt\n for further information regarding the issuance and redemption of senior notes.\nThe credit agreement underlying our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contains customary covenants, as well as financial covenants, including, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Our maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio under the credit agreement may not exceed 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2024, we had $950 million of borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, $2.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan Facility and we were in compliance with all covenants. As of December 31, 2024, there were no limitations on the availability of our Revolving Credit Facility as a result of the debt-to-EBITDA ratio.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $145 million as of December 31, 2024, which were not part of our Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit bore weighted interest of 0.7% as of December 31, 2024. In addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $844 million as of December 31, 2024.\nAt December 31, 2024, our debt-to-capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 41.2%, compared to 40.7% at December 31, 2023. The debt-to-capital ratio increase was driven by stock repurchases and increased borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in 2024 to fund pharmacy benefit-related activities, partially offset by net earnings. We utilize the debt-to-capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $3.7 billion, compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2023. We manage our short-term and long-term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we received dividends of $3.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.\n56\nTable of Contents\n2025 Expectations\nDuring 2025, we expect to receive net dividends of approximately $1.9 billion from our regulated subsidiaries and expect to spend approximately $700 million in capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements.\nWe have material short-term medical claims, debt and lease obligations. Refer to\n \nNote 8. \nMedical Claims Liability, \nNote 10. \nDebt \nand Note 11. \nLeases,\n respectively\n, \nfor further information.\nBased on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing. While we are currently in a strong liquidity position and believe we have adequate access to capital, we may elect to increase borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in August 2026. Additionally, our senior notes mature between December 2027 and August 2031. From time to time, we may elect to raise additional funds for working capital and other purposes, either through issuance of debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise, as appropriate. In addition, we may strategically pursue refinancing or redemption opportunities to extend maturities and/or improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us.\nWe intend to continue to target initiatives to improve productivity, efficiencies and reduced organizational costs, as well as capital deployment activities, including stock repurchases, portfolio optimization and the evaluation of refinancing opportunities. In addition to creating shareholder value, these actions encompass a larger organizational mission to enhance our member and provider experience, improve outcomes for our members and innovate to ensure that Centene is a great partner in all aspects of our operations.\n57\nTable of Contents\nREGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\n \nOur operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As managed care organizations (MCOs), most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity's level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $20.3 billion, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of $9.1 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we received dividends of $3.2 billion from and made $752 million of capital contributions to our regulated subsidiaries. For our subsidiaries that file with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), we estimate our Risk Based Capital (RBC) percentage to be in excess of 350% of the Authorized Control Level.\nUnder the California Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, as amended (Knox-Keene), certain of our California subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity (TNE) requirements. Under these Knox-Keene TNE requirements, actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of (i) a fixed minimum amount, (ii) a minimum amount based on premiums or (iii) a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures, excluding capitated amounts.\nUnder the New York State Department of Health Codes, Rules and Regulations Title 10, Part 98, our New York subsidiary must comply with contingent reserve requirements. Under these requirements, net worth based upon admitted assets must equal or exceed a minimum amount based on annual net premium income.\nThe NAIC has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, MCOs and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. As of December 31, 2024, each of our health plans was in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted in those states.\nAs a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies. Such restrictions, unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted, limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations. The maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus, statutory income and unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was $9.1 billion in the aggregate. \n58\nTable of Contents\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor this information, refer to Note 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\n to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our accounting policies regarding intangible assets, medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n \nWe have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. These intangible assets primarily consist of purchased contract rights and customer relationships, provider contracts, trade names, developed technologies and goodwill. Key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets include, but are not limited to, member attrition rates, contract renewal probabilities, revenue growth rates, expectations of profitability and discount and royalty rates. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. At December 31, 2024, we had $17.6 billion of goodwill and $5.4 billion of other intangible assets.\nIntangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the following periods:\nIntangible Asset\nAmortization Period\nPurchased contract rights and customer relationships\n3 - 21 years\nProvider contracts\n4 - 15 years\nTrade names\n7 - 20 years\nDeveloped technologies\n2 - 7 years\nOur management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. If the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired, the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset. Our management must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external factors, in determining the estimated fair values. While we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results. \nGoodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. In addition, an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors. These factors include significant changes in membership, financial performance, state funding, government contracts and provider networks and contracts.\nWe operate in four segments: (1) a Medicaid segment, (2) a Medicare segment, (3) a Commercial segment and (4) an Other segment. We define our reporting units as our operating segments or one level below the operating segment. If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. We generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. However, in certain circumstances, such as recent acquisitions, we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors.\nWe do not believe any of our reporting units are currently at risk for impairment.\n59\nTable of Contents\nMedical Claims Liability \nOur medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid, or claims inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. We estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. These actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors.\n    \nActuarial Standards of Practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions. Moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate. The claims amounts ultimately settled will most likely be different than the estimate that satisfies the Actuarial Standards of Practice. We include in our IBNR an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving.\nWe use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates. The assumptions we consider when estimating IBNR include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to fee schedules and the incidence of high-dollar or catastrophic claims.\nWe apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated. For more recent periods, incurred non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors. Incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors. For older periods, we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop IBNR estimates. The completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims that have been received or adjudicated as of the end of a reporting period relative to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs for that same period. When we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability. See \"Risk Factors - \nFailure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\" These approaches are consistently applied to each period presented.\nOur development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available. As more complete claims information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods. We consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period. As additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates.\nWe review actual and anticipated experience compared to the assumptions used to establish medical costs. We establish premium deficiency reserves if actual and anticipated experience indicates that existing policy liabilities together with the present value of future gross premiums will not be sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits, settlement and maintenance costs. For purposes of determining premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts and expected investment income is excluded. We recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $250 million in December 2023 related to the 2024 Medicare Advantage contract year. In December 2024, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $92 million related to the 2025 Medicare Advantage contract year.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe paid and received completion factors, claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the IBNR estimate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on December 31, 2024 data:\nCompletion Factors: \n(1)\nCost Trend Factors: \n(2)\n(Decrease) Increase in Factors\nIncrease (Decrease) in Medical Claims Liabilities\n(Decrease) Increase in Factors\nIncrease (Decrease) in Medical Claims Liabilities\n \n(In millions)\n(In millions)\n(1.00)\n%\n$\n1,221 \n(1.00)\n%\n$\n(240)\n(0.75)\n912 \n(0.75)\n(180)\n(0.50)\n605 \n(0.50)\n(120)\n(0.25)\n301 \n(0.25)\n(60)\n0.25 \n(299)\n0.25 \n60 \n0.50 \n(596)\n0.50 \n120 \n0.75 \n(890)\n0.75 \n180 \n1.00 \n(1,181)\n1.00 \n240 \n(1)\nReflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in completion factors.\n(2)\nReflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in cost trend factors for the most recent periods.\nWhile we believe our estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates. For example, a 1% increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, excluding the effect of any return of premium, risk corridor or minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) programs. The estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observation of trends in the industry, information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources.\n \nThe change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows (in millions): \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance, January 1,\n$\n18,000 \n$\n16,745 \n$\n14,243 \nLess: Reinsurance recoverables\n49 \n26 \n23 \nBalance, January 1, net\n17,951 \n16,719 \n14,220 \nAcquisitions and divestitures\n— \n— \n105 \nIncurred related to:\nCurrent year\n128,312 \n120,680 \n112,896 \nPrior years\n(2,447)\n(2,036)\n(1,367)\nTotal incurred\n125,865 \n118,644 \n111,529 \nPaid related to:\nCurrent year\n111,456 \n104,725 \n97,799 \nPrior years\n13,959 \n12,937 \n11,336 \nTotal paid\n125,415 \n117,662 \n109,135 \nPlus: Premium deficiency reserve\n(158)\n250 \n— \nBalance, December 31, net\n18,243 \n17,951 \n16,719 \nPlus: Reinsurance recoverables\n65 \n49 \n26 \nBalance, December 31,\n$\n18,308 \n$\n18,000 \n$\n16,745 \nDays in claims payable \n(1)\n53 \n54 \n54 \n(1)\nDays in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year.\n61\nTable of Contents\nMedical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider. As a result, the liability generally is described as having a \"short-tail,\" which causes less than 10% of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year. We believe that the vast majority of the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of December 31, 2024 will be known by the end of 2025.\nChanges in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions. Additionally, as a result of minimum MLR and other return of premium programs, approximately $243 million, $382 million and $198 million of the \"Incurred related to: Prior years\" was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Further, claims processing and coordination of benefits initiatives yielded claim payment recoveries related to dates of service from prior years. Changes in medical utilization, claims submission patterns, and cost trends and the effect of population health management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates. While we have evidence that population health management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis, these initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim. Accordingly, any change in behavior, leveling of care or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result, the costs prior to the population health management initiative are not known by us. Additionally, certain population health management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member's acuity. In these cases, determining whether the population health management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined. Because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate and the volume of claims that we process, we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of IBNR.\nRevenue Recognition \n \nOur health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans, premiums received from our members and CMS for our Medicare product and premiums from members of our commercial health plans. In addition to member premium payments, our Marketplace contracts also generate revenues from subsidies received from CMS. We generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable. In some instances, our base premiums are subject to an adjustment, in the form of a risk score or risk adjustment, based on the acuity of our membership. Generally, the risk score or risk adjustment is determined by the state or CMS analyzing submissions of processed claims and medical record data to determine the acuity of our membership, often relative to the respective program's membership. We estimate the amount of risk score and risk adjustment based upon the processed claims and medical record data submitted and expected to be submitted to the state or CMS and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis. Some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries.\nOur contracts with states and CMS may require us to maintain a minimum MLR or may require us to share cost-savings in excess of certain levels. In certain circumstances, including commercial plans, our plans may be required to return premium to the state or policyholders in the event costs are below established levels. We estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period. Other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue. For performance-based contracts, we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance.\nRevenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states or CMS, which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states or CMS for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data. These eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known. We review and update those estimates as new information becomes available. It is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments, which could be significant, to these estimates.\nOur Medicare Advantage contracts are with CMS. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events. We and the healthcare providers collect, compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis.\n62\nTable of Contents\nFor qualifying low-income prescription drug benefit members, CMS pays for some, or all, of the member's monthly premium. We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for these members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. Approximately nine to ten months subsequent to the end of the plan year, or later in the case of the coverage gap discount subsidy, a settlement payment is made between CMS and our plans based on the difference between the prospective payments and actual claims experience. \nOur specialty companies generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs, healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations and from our own subsidiaries. Revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services. For performance-based measures in our contracts, revenue is recognized as data sufficient to measure performance is available. We recognize revenue related to administrative services under the TRICARE government-sponsored Managed Care Support Contract for the Department of Defense (DoD's) TRICARE program on a straight-line basis over the option period, when the fees become fixed and determinable. The TRICARE contract includes various performance-based measures. For each of the measures, an estimate of the amount that has been earned is made at each interim date, and revenue is recognized accordingly. We concluded serving members at the end of 2024 upon the expiration of its TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract.\nSome states enact premium taxes, similar assessments and provider pass-through payments, collectively premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses. For certain products, premium taxes and state assessments are not pass-through payments and are recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSome states require state directed payments that have minimal risk, but are administered as a premium adjustment. These payments are recorded as premium revenue and medical costs at close to a 100% HBR. In many instances, we have little visibility to the timing of these payments until they are paid by the state.\n63\nTable of Contents",
