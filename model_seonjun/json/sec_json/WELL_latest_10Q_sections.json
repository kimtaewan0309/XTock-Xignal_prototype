Other important factors are identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, including factors identified under the headings \"Business,\" \"Risk Factors,\" and \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" \nWe are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through Welltower OP LLC, the day-to-day management of which is exclusively controlled by Welltower Inc. Welltower Inc. has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in Welltower OP LLC. Welltower OP LLC is generally the borrower under, and Welltower Inc. is the guarantor of, the unsecured notes described in Note 11 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. \nUnless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to \"Welltower\" mean Welltower Inc. and references to \"Welltower OP\" mean Welltower OP LLC.

(NYSE: WELL), an S&P 500 company, is one of the world’s preeminent residential wellness and healthcare infrastructure companies. We seek to position our portfolio of 1,500+ seniors and wellness housing communities at the intersection of housing, healthcare and hospitality, creating vibrant communities for mature renters and older adults in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. We also strive to support physicians in our outpatient medical buildings with the critical infrastructure needed to deliver quality care. \nWelltower is the initial member and majority owner of Welltower OP, with an approximate ownership interest of 99.674% as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n. All of our property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through Welltower OP and Welltower has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in Welltower OP. Welltower issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute as additional capital to Welltower OP. All debt including credit facilities, senior notes and secured debt is incurred by Welltower OP and its subsidiaries, and Welltower has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all existing senior unsecured notes issued by Welltower OP.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio for the three months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n (dollars in thousands):\n \n \nPercentage of\nNumber of\nType of Property\nNOI\n(1)\nNOI\nProperties\nSeniors Housing Operating\n$\n570,900 \n57.0 \n%\n1,244 \nTriple-net\n278,410 \n27.8 \n%\n667 \nOutpatient Medical\n151,853 \n15.2 \n%\n370 \nTotals\n$\n1,001,163 \n100.0 \n%\n2,281 \n(1)\n Represents consolidated NOI and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for additional information and reconciliation.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in NOI and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and healthcare real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services, interest earned on outstanding loans receivable and interest earned on short-term deposits. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nTo mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, \n37\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ncapital improvement needs and market conditions among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.\nIn addition to our asset management and research efforts, we aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. Also, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.\nFor t\nhe nine months ended September 30, 2025, residen\nt fees and services and rental income \nrepresen\nted 77% and 19%, respectively, of total revenues. Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.\nOur primary sources of cash include resident fees and services revenue, rental income and interest receipts, interest earned on short-term deposits, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, issuances of debt and equity securities, including through our ATM program (as defined below), proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.\nWe also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, equity issuances, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions.\nDepending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future and we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. In the event that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program or issue debt or equity securities, including through our ATM program. At \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, we had $6,806,507,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $134,066,000 of restricted cash and $5,000,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. \nKey Transactions\nCa\npital \nThe following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2025:\n•\nIn March 2025, we entered into the ATM Program pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to $7,500,000,000 of common stock, which replaced our prior equity distribution agreement dated October 29, 2024, allowing us to sell up to $5,000,000,000 of common stock (collectively, along with other previous agreements, referred to as the \"ATM Program\"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we sold 45,080,143 shares of common stock under the ATM Program generating gross proceeds of approximately $6,873,247,000.\n•\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we extinguished $288,492,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 5.37%.\n•\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we assumed $469,130,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 4.45%.\n•\nIn June 2025, we repaid our $1,250,000,000 4.0% senior unsecured notes at maturity. Additionally, we completed the issuance of $600,000,000 of 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2030 and $650,000,000 of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2035. \n•\nIn August 2025, we completed a follow-on issuance of $400,000,000 of 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2030 and $600,000,000 of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2035. These notes are fungible with and form a single series with the notes issued in June 2025.\n38\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInvestments\n The following summarizes our property acquisitions and joint venture investments completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 (dollars in thousands):\n \n \nProperties\nBook Amount\n(1)\nCapitalization Rates\n(2)\nSeniors Housing Operating\n114\n$\n2,981,984 \n5.9 \n%\nTriple-net\n124 \n2,274,556 \n8.7 \n%\nOutpatient Medical\n1 \n24,119 \n5.8 \n%\nTotals\n239 \n$\n5,280,659 \n7.1 \n%\n(1)\n Represents amounts recorded in net real estate investments including fair value adjustments pursuant to U.S. GAAP. See Note 3 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(2)\n Represents annualized contractual or projected NOI to be received in cash divided by investment amounts.\nDispositions\n The following summarizes property dispositions completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 (dollars in thousands):\n \n \nProperties\nProceeds\n(1)\nBook Amount\n(2)\nCapitalization Rates\n(3)\nSeniors Housing Operating\n(4)\n32\n$\n537,043 \n$\n485,489 \n9.2 \n%\nTriple-net\n4\n248,854 \n250,555 \n7.8 \n%\nOutpatient Medical\n1\n27,170 \n5,541 \n5.9 \n%\nTotals\n37 \n$\n813,067 \n$\n741,585 \n8.7 \n%\n(1)\n Represents cash and non-cash proceeds received upon disposition.\n(2)\n Represents carrying value of net real estate assets at time of disposition.

At closing, which is expected in early 2026, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, we expect to assume C$567 million of secured debt with an average interest rate of 3.7%. \nAnnounced Transactions Subsequent to September 30, 2025\nIn October 2025, we entered into definitive agreements and/or closed several acquisitions in the U.K. These acquisitions include:\n•\nThe acquisition in the U.K., through a series of transactions of a portfolio of seniors housing real estate for £5.2 billion, including 6.6 million OP units. The portfolio consists of 111 properties held in a RIDEA structure managed by Barchester Healthcare, 152 properties subject to a triple-net lease with Barchester and 21 properties under development which will also be managed by Barchester in a RIDEA structure following development completion.\n•\nThe acquisition of the HC-One Group portfolio in the U.K., which consists of 279 leased and owned seniors housing properties for £1.2 billion. The properties will be included in our Seniors Housing Operating segment. Our existing \n39\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nreal estate loan receivable of £660 million, equity warrants and equity interest were settled in conjunction with the transaction, resulting in reduced cash consideration.\n•\nWe have closed or are under contract to close an additional $4.7 billion of seniors housing acquisitions. The acquisitions not yet closed are subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and expected to close during the fourth quarter or in 2026.\nThese transactions are fully funded through available liquidity as of September 30, 2025 and the following:\n•\nOn August 14, 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portfolio of 319 consolidated and unconsolidated outpatient medical properties for approximately $7.2 billion. Net proceeds are expected to total approximately $6.0 billion following the reinvestment of a portion of the gross proceeds into a mandatorily redeemable preferred equity investment in the disposed real estate portfolio accompanied by a profits interest. The disposition will occur in tranches expected to close over the next 12 months. In October 2025, we disposed of 123 properties with a gross purchase price of $2.0 billion with the closing of the first tranche of the transaction.\n•\nIn October 2025, we issued $2.7 billion of Canadian-denominated unsecured term loans (approximately $2.0 billion based on the Canadian/U.S. Dollar exchange rates upon funding). The term loans mature on October 9, 2026, and bear interest at CORRA plus 0.30%. \nDividend\ns\n Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 of $0.74 per share. On November 20, 2025, we will pay our 218th consecutive quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of record on November 11, 2025. \nKey Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.\nOperating Performance\n We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (\"NICS\") per the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are the most appropriate earnings measures. Other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (\"FFO\") and consolidated net operating income (\"NOI\"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion and reconciliations. These earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. \nThe following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands): \n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n \n2025\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2024\n2024\n2024\nNet income (loss)\n$\n282,186 \n$\n304,618 \n$\n257,266 \n$\n123,753 \n$\n456,800 \n$\n260,670 \n$\n131,634 \nNICS\n280,559 \n301,888 \n257,957 \n119,971 \n449,849 \n254,714 \n127,146 \nFFO\n824,375 \n825,717 \n765,197 \n637,140 \n635,817 \n493,773 \n556,703 \nNOI\n1,108,644 \n1,033,533 \n960,697 \n841,530 \n842,962 \n713,587 \n762,828 \nCredit Strength \nWe measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and restricted cash. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest and secured debt principal amortization). We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"). Please refer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:\n \n40\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n \n2025\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2024\n2024\n2024\nNet debt to book capitalization ratio\n20%\n24%\n26%\n27%\n28%\n27%\n29%\nNet debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio\n17%\n19%\n21%\n22%\n23%\n22%\n24%\nNet debt to enterprise value ratio\n8%\n10%\n11%\n13%\n13%\n15%\n17%\nInterest coverage ratio\n6.21x\n6.75x\n6.14x\n4.94x\n6.83x\n5.59x\n4.29x\nFixed charge coverage ratio\n5.60x\n6.03x\n5.58x\n4.51x\n6.37x\n5.21x\n3.98x\nConcentration Risk\n We evaluate our concentration risk in terms of NOI by property mix, relationship mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our NOI could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Property mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our various property types and excludes interest income earned on our loan portfolio, which is classified as Non-segment/Corporate. Relationship mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five relationships. Geographic mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five states (or countries outside the United States).  \nThe following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk by NOI for the periods indicated below: \n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n \n2025\n2025\n2025\n2024\n2024\n2024\n2024\nProperty mix:\n(1)\n \n \n \n \n \nSeniors Housing Operating\n57%\n56%\n55%\n57%\n51%\n57%\n50%\nTriple-net\n28%\n28%\n28%\n24%\n30%\n21%\n31%\nOutpatient Medical\n15%\n16%\n17%\n19%\n19%\n22%\n19%\nRelationship mix:\n(1)\n \n \nCogir Management Corporation\n8%\n8%\n7%\n7%\n7%\n8%\n8%\nCare UK\n5%\n5%\n5%\n6%\n1%\n1%\n1%\nSunrise Senior Living\n5%\n5%\n5%\n5%\n5%\n6%\n5%\nIntegra Healthcare Properties\n4%\n5%\n5%\n6%\n6%\n8%\n7%\nOakmont Management Group\n4%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n5%\n4%\nRemaining relationships\n74%\n73%\n74%\n72%\n77%\n72%\n75%\nGeographic mix:\n(1)\n \n \nUnited Kingdom\n13%\n13%\n12%\n14%\n10%\n10%\n10%\nTexas\n11%\n10%\n9%\n5%\n8%\n9%\n8%\nCalifornia\n10%\n10%\n11%\n12%\n11%\n13%\n11%\nCanada\n8%\n8%\n7%\n6%\n6%\n7%\n7%\nFlorida\n6%\n7%\n7%\n7%\n7%\n9%\n7%\nRemaining geographic areas in the U.S.\n52%\n52%\n54%\n56%\n58%\n52%\n57%\n(1)\n Excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities and non-segment/corporate NOI.

Our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, under the headings \"Business,\" \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nCorporate Governance\nMaintaining investor confidence and trust is important in today's business environment. Our Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. These guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on our website at www.welltower.com/investors/governance. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, interest earned on short-term deposits, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash for the next twelve months and thereafter. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are discussed in further detail below. \n42\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n \nNine Months Ended\nChange\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\n$\n%\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n$\n3,711,457 \n$\n2,076,083 \n$\n1,635,374 \n79 \n%\nCash provided from (used in) operating activities\n2,227,348 \n1,697,209 \n530,139 \n31 \n%\nCash provided from (used in) investing activities\n(5,057,578)\n(3,309,218)\n(1,748,360)\n(53)\n%\nCash provided from (used in) financing activities\n5,967,156 \n3,315,287 \n2,651,869 \n80 \n%\nEffect of foreign currency translation\n92,190 \n5,047 \n87,143 \n1727 \n%\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n$\n6,940,573 \n$\n3,784,408 \n$\n3,156,165 \n83 \n%\nOperating Activities\n \nPlease see \"Results of Operations\" for discussion of net income fluctuations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, cash flows provided from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders. \nInvesting Activities\n The changes in net cash provided from/used in investing activities are pri\nmarily attributable to net changes in real property investments and dispositions, loans receivable and investments in unconsolidated entities, which are summarized above in \"Key Transactions.\" Please refer t\no Notes 3 and 5 of our u\nnaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information. Th\ne following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n \n \nNine Months Ended\nChange\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\n$\n%\nNew development\n$\n333,981 \n$\n632,511 \n$\n(298,530)\n(47.2)\n%\nRecurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions\n250,948 \n199,861 \n51,087 \n25.6 \n%\nRenovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements\n485,340 \n338,891 \n146,449 \n43.2 \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,070,269 \n$\n1,171,263 \n$\n(100,994)\n(8.6)\n%\nThe change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. Renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization. The increase in renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements is due primarily to portfolio growth. \nFinancing Activities\n The changes in net cash provided from/used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuances of common stock and dividend payments. Financing activities that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 are summarized above in \"Key Transactions.\" Please also refer to Notes 10, 11 and 14 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIn January 2024, we repaid our $400,000,000 4.5% senior unsecured notes at maturity. In March 2024, we repaid our $950,000,000 3.625% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\nIn July 2024, we issued $1,035,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.125% exchangeable senior unsecured notes maturing July 15, 2029. \nAlso in July 2024, we closed on an expanded $5,000,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our $4,000,000,000 existing line of credit. The new facility is comprised of a $3,000,000,000 revolving line of credit maturing in June 2028 that can be extended for an additional year and a $2,000,000,000 revolving line of credit maturing in June 2029. Please also refer to Note 10 for additional information.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 53,547,363 shares of common stock under our ATM Programs generating gross proceeds of approximately $5,288,418,000.\nSee \"Key Transactions\" for a description of 2025 financing activities.\nForeign Currency Translation\n The change in cash from foreign currency translation during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 is primarily due to the mark-to-market adjustment of Canadian dollar funds sent to pre-fund the Amica Senior Lifestyles transaction. Please refer to Note 3 of our u\nnaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \nAt September 30, 2025, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 95%. We use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. At September \n43\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n30, 2025, we had 17 outstanding letters of credit obligations. Please see Notes 8, 12 and 13 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe have entered into put-call agreements with third parties in conjunction with certain development projects. Under these agreements, we can initiate a call right or the third party can initiate a put right upon certain conditions being met, which would result in the acquisition of the related property by us, for which we currently have no ownership interest. If all conditions had been met under these agreements as of September 30, 2025, and the put or call rights for each investment had been triggered, the amount payable by us to acquire these properties would have been $337,049,000.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our payment requirements under contractual obligations as of September 30, 2025 (in thousands):\n \nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\n2025\n2026-2027\n2028-2029\nThereafter\nSenior unsecured notes and term credit facilities:\n(1)\nU.S. Dollar senior unsecured notes\n$\n11,620,000 \n$\n— \n$\n1,200,000 \n$\n3,870,000 \n$\n6,550,000 \nCanadian Dollar senior unsecured notes\n(2)\n215,370 \n— \n215,370 \n— \n— \nPounds Sterling senior unsecured notes\n(2)\n1,411,620 \n— \n— \n739,420 \n672,200 \nU.S. Dollar term credit facility\n1,087,321 \n— \n1,000,000 \n87,321 \n— \nCanadian Dollar term credit facility\n(2)\n179,475 \n— \n179,475 \n— \n— \nSecured debt: \n(1,2)\nConsolidated\n2,629,981 \n26,037 \n622,917 \n611,148 \n1,369,879 \nUnconsolidated\n744,328 \n34,033 \n173,363 \n55,306 \n481,626 \nContractual interest obligations:\n(3)\nSenior unsecured notes and term loans\n(2)\n3,673,447 \n143,699 \n1,065,750 \n785,346 \n1,678,652 \nConsolidated secured debt\n(2)\n717,556 \n26,952 \n191,376 \n140,458 \n358,770 \nUnconsolidated secured debt\n(2)\n188,358 \n9,977 \n72,579 \n57,351 \n48,451 \nFinancing lease liabilities\n(4)\n451,539 \n1,999 \n15,302 \n10,726 \n423,512 \nOperating lease liabilities\n(4)\n2,373,481 \n21,161 \n174,138 \n171,230 \n2,006,952 \nPurchase obligations\n(5)\n369,410 \n103,746 \n252,171 \n411 \n13,082 \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n25,661,886 \n$\n367,604 \n$\n5,162,441 \n$\n6,528,717 \n$\n13,603,124 \n(1)\n Amounts represent principal amounts due and do not reflect unamortized premiums/discounts or other fair value adjustments as reflected on the balance sheet.\n(2)\n Based on foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date.\n(3)\n Based on variable interest rates in effect as of the balance sheet date.\n(4)\n See Note 6 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(5) \nSee Note 13 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information. Excludes amounts related to acquisitions under contract that have not yet closed as of September 30, 2025, including the acquisitions described in Note 3. \nCapital Structure\nPlease refer to \"Credit Strength\" above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. We plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nOn March 28, 2025, Welltower and Welltower OP jointly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") an open-ended automatic or “universal” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the \"New Registration Statement\") covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of Welltower's debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, guarantees of debt securities issued by Welltower OP, warrants and units and Welltower OP’s debt securities and guarantees of \n44\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ndebt securities issued by Welltower. In connection with the filing of the New Registration Statement, on March 28, 2025, Welltower filed with the SEC five prospectus supplements, as described below. On March 28, 2025, Welltower also filed with the SEC a registration statement in connection with its enhanced dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") under which it may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. As of October 24, 2025, 15,000,000 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the DRIP registration statement. \nThe first prospectus supplement filed in connection with the New Registration Statement related to the ATM Program (as defined below). On March 28, 2025, Welltower and Welltower OP entered into an equity distribution agreement (the \"EDA\") with (i) BofA Securities, Inc., BBVA Securities Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Capital One Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Huntington Securities, Inc., Jefferies LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Loop Capital Markets LLC, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Regions Securities LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Synovus Securities, Inc., TD Securities (USA) LLC, Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as sales agents and forward sellers and (ii) the forward purchasers named therein relating to issuances, offers and sales from time to time of up to $7,500,000,000 aggregate amount of common stock of Welltower (together with the existing master forward sale confirmations relating thereto, the \"ATM Program\"). The ATM Program also allows Welltower to enter into forward sale agreements. As of October 24, 2025, we had approximately $2,240,602,000 of remaining capacity under the ATM Program and there were no outstanding forward sales agreements. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.\nThe second prospectus supplement filed in connection with the New Registration Statement continued an offering that was previously covered by a prior registration statement relating to the registration and possible issuance of up to 390,590 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc. (the “DownREIT Shares”) that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A units (the “DownREIT Units”) of HCN G&L DownREIT II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “DownREIT”), tender such DownREIT Units for redemption by the DownREIT, and HCN DownREIT Member, LLC, a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (including its permitted successors and assigns, the “Managing Member”), or a designated affiliate of the Managing Member, elects to assume the redemption obligations of the DownREIT and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing DownREIT Shares to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount.\nThe third such prospectus supplement continued an offering that was previously covered by a prior registration statement relating to the registration and possible issuance of up to 238,868 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc. that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A Common Units (the \"OP Units\") of Welltower OP tender the OP Units for redemption by Welltower OP, and Welltower Inc. elects to assume the redemption obligations of Welltower OP and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing shares of its common stock to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount. \nThe fourth such prospectus supplement continued an offering that was previously covered by a prior registration statement relating to the registration and possible issuance of up to 23,471,419 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc. (the \"Exchangeable Shares\") that may, under certain circumstances, be issuable upon exchange of the 2.750% exchangeable senior notes due 2028 or 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2029 of Welltower OP, and the resale from time to time by the recipients of such Exchangeable Shares.\nThe fifth such prospectus supplement registered the offer and resale by the selling stockholder identified therein of up to 1,563,904 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc., which Welltower issued as consideration for its recent acquisition of certain properties.\nOn July 29, 2025, Welltower filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement to register the offer and resale by the selling stockholder identified therein of up to 949,412 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc., which Welltower issued as consideration for its recent acquisition of certain properties.\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\nWelltower OP has issued the unsecured notes described in Note 11 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. All unsecured notes issued by Welltower OP are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Welltower, and Welltower OP is 99.674% \nown\ned by Welltower as of September 30, 2025. Effective January 4, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements applicable to registered debt offerings that include certain credit enhancements. We have adopted these new rules, which permits subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent to omit separate financial statements if the consolidated financial statements of the parent company have been filed, the subsidiary obligor is a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company, the guaranteed security is debt or debt-like, and the security is guaranteed fully and unconditionally by the parent. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of Welltower OP have not been presented. Furthermore, \n45\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWelltower and Welltower OP have no material assets, liabilities, or operations other than financing activities and their investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries. Therefore, we meet the criteria in Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X to omit the summarized financial information from our disclosures.\n46\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nResults of Operations\nSummary\nOur primary sources of revenue include resident fees and services, rent, interest income and interest earned on short-term deposits. Our primary expenses include property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. The primary performance measures for our properties are NOI and same store NOI (\"SSNOI\") and other supplemental measures include FFO and EBITDA, which are further discussed below. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations related to these supplemental measures (in thousands, except per share data). \n \nThree Months Ended\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nChange\n \nSeptember 30,\n \n \nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nAmount\n%\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n%\nNet income (loss)\n$\n282,186 \n$\n456,800 \n$\n(174,614)\n(38)\n%\n$\n844,070 \n$\n849,104 \n$\n(5,034)\n(1)\n%\nNICS\n280,559 \n449,849 \n(169,290)\n(38)\n%\n840,404 \n831,709 \n8,695 \n1 \n%\nFFO\n824,375 \n635,817 \n188,558 \n30 \n%\n2,415,289 \n1,686,293 \n728,996 \n43 \n%\nEBITDA\n956,385 \n994,923 \n(38,538)\n(4)\n%\n2,780,827 \n2,423,169 \n357,658 \n15 \n%\nNOI\n1,108,644 \n842,962 \n265,682 \n32 \n%\n3,102,874 \n2,319,377 \n783,497 \n34 \n%\nSSNOI\n601,087 \n525,676 \n75,411 \n14 \n%\n1,636,662 \n1,419,996 \n216,666 \n15 \n%\nPer share data (fully diluted):\n \n \n \n \nNICS\n$\n0.41 \n$\n0.73 \n$\n(0.32)\n(44)\n%\n$\n1.26 \n$\n1.39 \n$\n(0.13)\n(9)\n%\nFFO\n$\n1.20 \n$\n1.03 \n$\n0.17 \n17 \n%\n$\n3.61 \n$\n2.81 \n$\n0.80 \n28 \n%\nInterest coverage ratio\n6.21 \nx\n6.83 \nx\n(0.62)\nx\n(9)\n%\n6.36 \nx\n5.55 \nx\n0.81 \nx\n15 \n%\nFixed charge coverage ratio\n5.60 \nx\n6.37 \nx\n(0.77)\nx\n(12)\n%\n5.73 \nx\n5.17 \nx\n0.56 \nx\n11 \n%\n47\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSeniors Housing Operating\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the Seniors Housing Operating segment (in thousands):\n \nThree Months Ended\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nChange\n \nSeptember 30,\n \n \nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nRevenues:\n \n \n \n \nResident fees and services\n$\n2,061,370 \n$\n1,511,524 \n$\n549,846 \n36 \n%\n$\n5,896,944 \n$\n4,265,271 \n$\n1,631,673 \n38 \n%\nOther income\n8,745 \n2,498 \n6,247 \n250 \n%\n16,774 \n5,861 \n10,913 \n186 \n%\nTotal revenues\n2,070,115 \n1,514,022 \n556,093 \n37 \n%\n5,913,718 \n4,271,132 \n1,642,586 \n38 \n%\nProperty operating expenses\n1,499,215 \n1,135,887 \n363,328 \n32 \n%\n4,322,176 \n3,190,140 \n1,132,036 \n35 \n%\nNOI \n(1)\n570,900 \n378,135 \n192,765 \n51 \n%\n1,591,542 \n1,080,992 \n510,550 \n47 \n%\nOther expenses:\n \n \nDepreciation and amortization\n368,523 \n279,693 \n88,830 \n32 \n%\n1,063,660 \n770,020 \n293,640 \n38 \n%\nInterest expense\n22,672 \n8,742 \n13,930 \n159 \n%\n58,522 \n27,254 \n31,268 \n115 \n%\nLoss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net\n— \n— \n— \nn/a\n6,156 \n1,711 \n4,445 \n260 \n%\nImpairment of assets\n3,081 \n20,887 \n(17,806)\n(85)\n%\n36,922 \n65,996 \n(29,074)\n(44)\n%\nOther expenses\n38,673 \n17,795 \n20,878 \n117 \n%\n65,797 \n64,276 \n1,521 \n2 \n%\n432,949 \n327,117 \n105,832 \n32 \n%\n1,231,057 \n929,257 \n301,800 \n32 \n%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and other items\n137,951 \n51,018 \n86,933 \n170 \n%\n360,485 \n151,735 \n208,750 \n138 \n%\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities\n(15,485)\n3,886 \n(19,371)\n(498)\n%\n(24,270)\n(3,550)\n(20,720)\n(584)\n%\nGain (loss) on real estate dispositions and acquisitions of controlling interests, net\n(1,313)\n63 \n(1,376)\nn/a\n50,725 \n141,726 \n(91,001)\n(64)\n%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n121,153 \n54,967 \n66,186 \n120 \n%\n386,940 \n289,911 \n97,029 \n33 \n%\nNet income (loss)\n121,153 \n54,967 \n66,186 \n120 \n%\n386,940 \n289,911 \n97,029 \n33 \n%\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(1,099)\n(490)\n(609)\n(124)\n%\n(1,698)\n(1,974)\n276 \n14 \n%\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\n$\n122,252 \n$\n55,457 \n$\n66,795 \n120 \n%\n$\n388,638 \n$\n291,885 \n$\n96,753 \n33 \n%\n(1)\n See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for additional information and reconciliations.\nResident fees and services and property operating expenses increased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to acquisitions, including the acquisition of Care UK as described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, construction conversions and the conversions of Triple-net properties to Seniors Housing Operating RIDEA structures throughout 2024 and into early 2025. Additionally, our Seniors Housing Operating revenues are dependent on occupancy and rate growth, both of which have continued to steadily increase from the prior year.

To the extent that we acquire, develop or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.\n48\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recorded $36,922,000 of impairment charges related to nine properties.

Additionally, a portion of the increase in rental income can be attributed to acquisitions. \nCertain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. \nDuring\n t\nhe nine months ended September 30, 2025\n, our Triple-net portfolio had 43 leases with rental rate increases and a weighted average increase of 4.2%. \nInterest income is primarily related to leases that were classified as sales-type leases.\nThe following is a summary of our SSNOI at Welltower's share for the Triple-net segment (in thousands):\nQTD Pool\nYTD Pool\n \nThree Months Ended\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nChange\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nSSNOI\n(1)\n$\n155,387 \n$\n151,643 \n$\n3,744 \n2.5 \n%\n$\n461,602 \n$\n448,265 \n$\n13,337 \n3.0 \n%\n(1)\n For the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, amounts relate to 468 and 465 same store properties.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of $3,150,000 related to two properties. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. The fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions and segment transitions.\n \nChanges in the gain (loss) on real estate dispositions and acquisitions of controlling interests, net were related to the volume, timing and price of related transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company, which held a 25% minority interest in an existing joint venture that owned 39 properties subject to triple-net leases with two tenants, acquired the remaining beneficial interest for $205,029,000 in cash, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. We evaluated the acquisition and determined that the entity met the criteria of a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). We consolidated the joint venture upon acquisition of the beneficial interests and recorded a gain on change of control of interests of $179,770,000 in gain (loss) on real estate dispositions and acquisitions of controlling interests, net on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nAdditionally, on September 30, 2024, we reached agreement with a tenant to sell 15 properties, which were included in two master leases previously classified as operating leases. As a result of the agreement to sell the properties, the two leases were classified as sales-type leases and $92,593,000 was recognized in gain (loss) on real estate dispositions and acquisitions of controlling interests, net.\nInterest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees. The change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, extinguishments and principal amortizations.

Please refer to Note 11 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information. The change in interest expense on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. Loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. \n54\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were 2.50% and \n3.25%\n, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $29,838,000 as a cumulative catch up of stock compensation expense due to the change in the probability of achievement of specific performance goals related to special non-recurring performance-based stock option and restricted stock awards granted in December 2021 and January 2022. In October 2025, the Board of Directors approved a new executive compensation program which includes new equity-based incentive awards and changes to the existing compensation programs. Please refer to Note 15 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nLoss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market of the equity warrants received as part of the HC-One Group valuation that closed in 2021 and 2023.\nThe fluctuation in provision for loan losses, net is related to adjustments to reserves for loan losses under the current expected credit losses accounting standard.\nThe provision for income taxes primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as taxable REIT subsidiaries.\nOther\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider FFO, NOI, SSNOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (\"FFO\") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means NICS, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and acquisitions of controlling interests, and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.\nNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to managers, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent general overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. Same store NOI (\"SSNOI\") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. We believe the drivers of property level NOI for both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties are generally the same and therefore, we evaluate SSNOI based on our ownership interest in each property (\"Welltower Share\"). To arrive at Welltower's Share, NOI is adjusted by adding our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and by subtracting the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests for consolidated properties. We do not control investments in unconsolidated properties and while we consider disclosures at Welltower Share to be useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in SSNOI five full quarters or seven full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. Land parcels, loans and leased properties, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the respective periods are excluded from SSNOI. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or seven full quarters post completion of the redevelopment for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or seven full quarters post completion of the transition for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. In addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God, or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or seven full quarters after the properties are placed back into service for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes adjustments to present consistent ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and U.K. properties using a consistent exchange rate. We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure \n55\nItem 2. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nthe operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our portfolio.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/losses on disposition of properties and acquisitions of controlling interests, impairment of assets, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, other impairment charges and other adjustments as deemed appropriate. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. We primarily use these measures to determine our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest and secured debt principal amortization. Covenants in our unsecured senior notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that is specific to those agreements. Our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization and include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and enterprise value. Book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Enterprise value represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock. \nOur supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. None of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.\nThe tables below reflect the reconciliation of FFO to NICS, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. Noncontrolling interest and unconsolidated entity amounts represent adjustments to reflect our share of depreciation and amortization, gains/loss on real estate dispositio\nns and acquisitions of

When Welltower uses words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" \"pro forma,\" \"estimate\" or similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters, Welltower is making forward-looking statements. These statements include, among other things, the Company's statements regarding its business strategy, expectations regarding new investments and investment dispositions, key underlying trends in its business and plans regarding future financing and availability of capital. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause Welltower's actual results to differ materially from Welltower's expectations discussed in the forward-looking statements. This may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to: the status of the economy; the status of capital markets, including availability and cost of capital; issues facing the healthcare industry, including compliance with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies, responding to government investigations and punitive settlements and operators'/tenants' difficulty in cost effectively obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance; changes in financing terms; competition within the healthcare and seniors housing industries; negative developments in the operating results or financial condition of operators/tenants, including, but not limited to, their ability to pay rent and repay loans; Welltower's ability to transition or sell properties with profitable results; the failure to make new investments or acquisitions as and when anticipated; natural disasters, health emergencies (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other acts of God affecting Welltower's properties; Welltower's ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies occur; Welltower's ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to assets sold; operator/tenant or joint venture partner bankruptcies or insolvencies; the cooperation of joint venture partners; government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and operational requirements; liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants; unanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to future investments or acquisitions; environmental laws affecting Welltower's properties; changes in rules or practices governing Welltower's financial reporting; the movement of U.S. and foreign currency exchange rates; Welltower's ability to maintain its qualification as a REIT; key management personnel recruitment and retention; and other risks described in Welltower’s reports filed from time to time with the SEC. Other important factors are identified in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, including factors identified under the headings \"Business,\" \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Finally, Welltower undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements."
