  "item1": "Item 1.\n \n Business\nUnless this Form 10-K indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Sysco,” or the “company” as used in this Form 10-K refer to Sysco Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries and divisions.\nOverview\nSysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions, is the largest global distributor of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. Our purpose is “Connecting the World to Share Food and Care for One Another.” We provided products and related services to approximately 730,000 customer locations, including restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers during fiscal 2025. \nFounded in 1969, Sysco commenced operations as a public company in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for Sysco common stock. Since our formation, we have grown from $115 million to our all-time high of $81.4 billion in annual sales in fiscal 2025, both through internal expansion of existing operations and acquisitions. \nSysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ended June 28, 2025 for fiscal 2025, a 52-week year ended June 29, 2024 for fiscal 2024 and a 52-week year ended July 1, 2023 for fiscal 2023. We will have a 52-week year ending June 27, 2026 for fiscal 2026. \nAvailable Information\nSysco Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. The address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077-2099, (281) 584-1390. This annual report on Form 10-K, as well as all other annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed or furnished by Sysco pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge on Sysco’s website at \nwww.sysco.com\n as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished with the SEC. Sysco also periodically provides certain information for investors on its website at \nwww.sysco.com\n. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to Sysco’s annual meeting of stockholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this filing.\nReporting Segments\nSysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our primary operations are in North America and Europe. Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have combined certain operations into three reportable segments. “Other” financial information is attributable to our other operations that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.\n•\nU.S. Foodservice Operations\n – primarily includes (a) our U.S. Broadline operations, which distribute a full line of food products, including custom-cut meat, seafood, produce, specialty Italian, specialty imports and a wide variety of non-food products and (b) our U.S. Specialty operations, which include our FreshPoint fresh produce distribution business, our Buckhead | Newport Meat & Seafood specialty protein operations, our growing Italian Specialty platform anchored by Greco & Sons, Inc., our Edward Don restaurant equipment and supplies distribution business, our Asian specialty distribution company and a number of other small specialty businesses that are not material to the operations of Sysco; \n•\nInternational Foodservice Operations\n – includes operations outside of the United States (U.S.), which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products. The Americas primarily consists of operations in Canada, Bahamas, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as our export operations that distribute to international customers. Our European operations primarily consist of operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Ireland and Sweden;\n•\nSYGMA\n – our U.S. customized distribution operations serving quick-service chain restaurant customer locations; and\n•\nOther\n – primarily our hotel supply operations, Guest Worldwide.\n1\nFoodservice operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both independent and chain restaurant customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. Selected financial data for each of our reportable segments, as well as financial information concerning geographic areas, can be found in Note 21, “Business Segment Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nCustomers and Products\nSysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants, hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, schools and colleges, hotels and motels, industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served.\nThe products we distribute include:\n•\nfrozen foods, such as meats, seafood, fully prepared entrées, fruits, vegetables and desserts;\n•\ncanned and dry foods;\n•\nfresh meats and seafood;\n•\ndairy products;\n•\nbeverage products;\n•\nimported specialties; and\n•\nfresh produce.\nWe also supply a wide variety of non-food items, including:\n•\npaper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups;\n•\ntableware such as glassware and silverware;\n•\ncookware such as pots, pans and utensils;\n•\nrestaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and\n•\ncleaning supplies.\nA comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below:\nPrincipal product categories\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFresh and frozen meats\n19 \n%\n18 \n%\n18 \n%\nCanned and dry products\n18 \n19 \n19 \nFrozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other\n15 \n15 \n15 \nDairy products\n11 \n10 \n11 \nPoultry\n10 \n10 \n10 \nFresh produce\n8 \n9 \n9 \nPaper and disposables\n7 \n7 \n7 \nBeverage products\n4 \n4 \n3 \nSeafood\n3 \n4 \n4 \nEquipment and smallwares \n2 \n2 \n1 \nOther\n (1)\n3 \n2 \n3 \nTotals\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n(1)\nOther sales relate to certain non-food products, including textiles and amenities for our hotel supply business, other janitorial products, and medical supplies.\nOur distribution centers, which we refer to as operating sites, distribute branded merchandise, as well as products packaged under our private brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for Sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements.\nWe believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, competitive pricing, customer service and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the \n2\nmarketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers. Our operating sites offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice. Through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff, we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services. We also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution, such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data, menu-planning advice, food safety training and assistance in inventory control. Additionally, we provide access to various third-party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses.\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of Sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2025.\nWe estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows:\nType of Customer\n2025\n2024\n2023\nRestaurants \n60 \n%\n62 \n%\n62 \n%\nEducation, government\n8 \n7 \n8 \nHealthcare\n8 \n7 \n7 \nTravel and leisure\n7 \n6 \n8 \nOther \n(1)\n17 \n18 \n15 \nTotals\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n(1)\nOther includes cafeterias that are not stand-alone restaurants, bakeries, caterers, churches, civic and fraternal organizations, vending distributors, other distributors and international exports, as well as retail food sales and logistics services. None of these types of customers, as a group, exceeded 5% of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented.\nWe estimate that sales to our customers in the food service management (FSM) sector, which include large customers that service cafeterias in institutions such as universities, hospitals, and sporting venues, accounted for 8% of sales in both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. These sales are reflected within the respective customer types listed in the table above, depending on the type of customer the FSM operator serves.\nSources of Supply\nWe purchase from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and international, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of our purchases for fiscal 2025. These suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise, as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers. We also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to mid-sized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products. Our locally sourced products, including produce, meats, cheese and other products, help differentiate our customers’ offerings, satisfy demand for new products, and support local communities. Merchandise is generally purchased through both centrally developed programs, domestically and internationally, and direct programs established by our various operating sites. For our U.S. Foodservice Operations, which represents approximately 70% of our total sales, over 90% of products are purchased domestically. \nWe administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food and non-food products. The program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise, as well as products from several national brand suppliers, encompassing substantially all product lines. Some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network. We also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and aggregate inventory levels. This reduces future facility expansion needs at our operating sites, while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers.\nWorking Capital Practices\nOur growth is funded through a combination of cash on hand, cash flow from operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings. See the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” regarding our liquidity, financial position and sources and uses of funds. \nWe extend credit terms to some of our customers based on our assessment of each customer’s creditworthiness. We monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary.\nA majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of customer order placement. We generally maintain inventory on hand to meet customer demand. The level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelf-life, supplier order \n3\nfulfillment lead times and customer demand. We also purchase additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities. We take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate. Otherwise, we pay our suppliers according to our payment terms.\nGlobal Support Center\nOur Global Support Center (GSC) provides numerous centralized services to our operating sites and performs support activities for employees, suppliers and customers. GSC team members possess experience and expertise in, among other areas, customer and vendor contract administration, finance, legal, information technology, risk management and insurance, sales and marketing, merchandising, inbound logistics, human resources, and strategy.\nCapital Improvements\nDuring fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, $906 million, $832 million and $793 million, respectively, were invested in facilities, technology, equipment, delivery fleet and other capital asset enhancements. From time to time, we dispose of assets in the normal course of business, and we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, were $692 million, $753 million and $751 million, respectively. Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.0%, respectively. During the three years ended June 28, 2025, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds along with bank and other borrowings. We expect our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, to approximate $700 million in fiscal 2026, and we expect to finance these capital expenditures from cash flows from operations and bank and other borrowings.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe engaged and empowered colleagues are key to business success. Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally drives the company’s long-term value. Our diverse colleagues and inclusive culture create an environment where colleagues can develop their skills and contribute to our success. As of June 28, 2025, we employed approximately 75,000 employees, including 51,000 U.S. employees and 24,000 employees outside the U.S., as compared to approximately 76,000 employees as of June 29, 2024. Also, approximately 99% of our U.S.-based colleagues are classified as full-time, defined as employees who work 30 or more hours per week. Approximately 14% of our employees were represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and unions in France and Sweden. Approximately 14% of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to renegotiation in fiscal 2026.\nTalent Acquisition and Talent Management \n— Maintaining a pipeline of talent is critical to our ongoing success and is essential to our succession planning efforts and to growing leaders throughout the organization. Our leadership is responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by cultivating a high-impact learning culture for our colleagues through a variety of enterprise development programs and learning resources, including goal setting and career development processes. We commit to investing in our employees through on-the-job training and coaching. Additionally, through our Sysco Speaks program, we conduct annual, confidential engagement surveys of our global workforce that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party.\nTotal Rewards \n— We are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors, such as an employee’s role and experience, job location and individual performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay. In fiscal 2025, our hourly colleagues received an average hourly wage of approximately $25, and 100% of colleagues in our U.S. distribution facilities received pay above state minimum wage thresholds. Also, some of our full-time colleagues receive paid vacation and sick time benefits, short-term and long-term incentives, retirement plans, training and development, access to career opportunities, paid pregnancy and adoption leave benefits, short-term and long-term disability benefits, health and welfare benefits, and recognition, as well as other programs like employee discounts.\nInclusion \n— Our Inclusion team develops and operationalizes global strategic initiatives that are designed to ensure that every colleague, customer, supplier and/or partner – regardless of identity, background, or life experience – feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute. To further this goal, our Chief Inclusion Officer works collaboratively with our Global Inclusion Council to ensure a strategy that meets the needs of our full colleague population, as well as the vibrant, diverse customers and communities we serve. Our global strategy is further advanced by our 11 Colleague Resource Groups (CRGs) – voluntary, colleague-led groups that enhance inclusion and belonging through programming and initiatives falling into the following areas: \n4\ncolleague, community, culture, and corporation. Each CRG is helmed by a VP+ level Executive Sponsor to ensure alignment with business priorities, and each group is open to all colleagues.\nAs of June 28, 2025, our U.S. employee population possessed the gender, ethnic and racial attributes identified below:\nUnited States Employee Population \n(1)\nMale\nFemale\nWhite\nHispanic or Latino\nBlack or African American\nAsian\nAmerican Indian or Alaskan Native\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\nTwo or more races\nNot Available\nIndividual Contributors\n80 \n%\n20 \n%\n40 \n%\n27 \n%\n22 \n%\n5 \n%\n1 \n%\n1 \n%\n2 \n%\n2 \n%\nManagement\n71 \n29 \n62 \n16 \n11 \n5 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n2 \nSenior Management\n73 \n27 \n76 \n8 \n6 \n5 \n— \n— \n1 \n4 \nOfficers\n76 \n24 \n63 \n7 \n9 \n3 \n2 \n— \n2 \n14 \nTotal Sysco\n79 \n21 \n43 \n26 \n21 \n5 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n1 \n(1)\nInformation is based on self-reported identification.\nInformation about our Executive Officers:\nThe section below provides information regarding our executive officers as of August 21, 2025. There are no family relationships between any of the officers named and any other executive officer or member of the Board of Directors, or any arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer. All officers are elected by the Board of Directors to hold office until their successors are elected and qualified.\nName\nAge\nPosition\nFirst Year in Present Position\nOther Positions Held July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2025\nKevin P.

Our customers may choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets, including club, cash and carry and grocery stores, online retailers, or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers. We compete with local and regional distributors and some organizations that operate on a multi-region basis. In addition, these local, regional and multi-regional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix, improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities. Our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently. Customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors; specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce, meat or seafood; other wholesale channels; club stores; cash and carry stores; grocery stores; and numerous online retailers. Since switching costs are very low, customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis, and competitive prices. There are few barriers to market entry. \nWe estimate that we serve about 17% of an approximately $370 billion annual foodservice market in the U.S., as estimated by Technomic, Inc., for calendar year 2024. Technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately $382 billion by the end of calendar 2025. We also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share. We believe, based upon industry trade data, our sales to the U.S. and Canada food-away-from-home industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2025. While comprehensive industry statistics are not available, we believe that, in most instances, our operations in the U.S. and Canada are among the leading distributors of food and related non-food products to foodservice customers in those trade areas. We believe our competitive advantages include our sales consultants; our diversified product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand products; our service reliability; the ancillary services we provide to our customers, such as business reviews and menu analysis; and our multi-regional presence in North America and Europe. These advantages combined with a large geographical footprint of multi-temperature warehouses, mitigate some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business.\nIn the U.S., as a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through \n6\ngood manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods; prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels; regulates food contact packaging and materials; and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990\n, \nthe Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of meat and poultry products, regulates the production, handling, labeling, and enforcement of all USDA organic products, and establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption.\nThe Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) has significantly expanded our food safety requirements, including certain mandatory safety prevention practices. The FDA has finalized numerous regulations implementing FSMA, recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to identify specific actions that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. We have established and continue to maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated, as required by FDA regulations implementing FSMA. FSMA further imposes requirements for food products imported into the U.S. All food intended for introduction into U.S. interstate commerce must be safe, sanitary, and labeled according to U.S. requirements.  Importers can import food into the U.S. as long as the facilities that produce, store, or otherwise handle the products are registered with the FDA, and prior notice of incoming shipments is provided to the FDA. Imported food products are subject to FDA inspection at U.S. ports of entry and the FDA may detain shipments of products if the shipments are found to be non-compliant with U.S. requirements. FSMA also provides the FDA with expanded enforcement authority, including mandatory recall authority over all articles of food (other than infant formula) that are manufactured, processed, packed, or held at a food facility that is required to register with the FDA.  \nAs a marketer and distributor of various non-food products, such as food containers and utensils, kitchen equipment, and cleaning supplies, we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to the safety, storage, transportation, sale, advertising and labeling of those non-food products, including requirements to provide information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute and regulations restricting the sale of products made with certain materials or chemicals. \nWe and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute. We are also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace. The Fair Labor Standards Act establishes minimum wages and overtime standards, among other requirements, and prohibits discrimination in employment based on non-merit categories, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other laws relating to accessibility. Our workers’ compensation programs are subject to regulation by the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the FDA and USDA. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. We also must comply with Federal Trade Commission standards with respect to any claims made about our food products in advertising and marketing materials.\nOur customers include several departments of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, as well as certain state and local entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.\nWe are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers. We are also subject to regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \n7\nwhich collectively regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations. We are subject to regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration covering items transported by air. In addition, we are subject to the federal False Claims Act, and similar state statutes, which prohibit knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government and the knowing and improper retention of overpayments. \nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized and recorded. We have implemented and continue to develop an anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our global operations intended to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anti-corruption laws in countries where we operate.\nOur business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us. Our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\nOutside the U.S., our business is subject to numerous similar statutes, regulations, and other regulatory requirements. For example, we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the U.K. and the European Union (EU), as well as those of EU countries, where we conduct business (including Ireland, France and Sweden). Those requirements relate to, among other things, competition, product composition, packaging, labeling, advertisement (including nutrition and health claims) and the safety of food products, as well as the health, safety and working conditions of employees. We are subject to privacy laws in the EU, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data. In addition, our business is subject to the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015, which requires certain companies that operate in the U.K. to prepare a report describing steps that they have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their supply chain or business. Our business is also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, an anti-corruption law that criminalizes the failure by a company to prevent persons associated with that company from offering or paying bribes to government officials or non-government persons in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company, as well as restricting the offer, payment or receipt of bribes to or from governmental officials and non-governmental persons.\nAll of our company’s facilities and other operations in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU, relating to: (1) the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater; (2) the discharge of pollutants into the air, including vehicle emissions; (3) proper handling, treatment and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; and (4) protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases. Further, most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks (including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks). See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operational Risks - We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and we may be subject to substantial fines, penalties, or third-party claims for non-compliance.”\nGiven the regulated nature of some of our operations, we routinely incur compliance-related costs, both direct and indirect. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for compliance with these laws, rules and regulations in the foreseeable future. However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information regarding government regulations that could impact our business.\nGeneral\nWe have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance, including the SYSCO® and Brakes® trademarks, in addition to our privately branded product trademarks that include these trademarks. These trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry. Both our U.S. and European trademarks are effective for a ten-year period, and we generally renew our trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use. We believe the loss of the SYSCO® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not have any material patents or licenses.\n8\nWe are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products.\nOur sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis; therefore, our business is not deemed to be seasonal.\nAs of June 28, 2025, we operated 337 distribution facilities throughout North America and Europe.",
  "item7": "Item 7.  \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of Sysco’s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal years ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 should be read as a supplement to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes contained in Item 8 of this report, and in conjunction with the “Forward-looking Statements” section set forth in Part II and the “Risk Factors” section set forth in Item 1A of Part I. All discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2023 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 28, 2024.\nOverview\nSysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our primary operations are in North America and Europe. Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have combined certain operations into three reportable segments. “Other” financial information is attributable to our other operations that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.\n•\nU.S. Foodservice Operations\n – primarily includes (a) our U.S. Broadline operations, which distribute a full line of food products, including custom-cut meat, seafood, produce, specialty Italian, specialty imports and a wide variety of non-food products and (b) our U.S. Specialty operations, which include our FreshPoint fresh produce \n26\ndistribution business, our Buckhead | Newport Meat & Seafood specialty protein operations, our growing Italian Specialty platform anchored by Greco & Sons, Inc., our Edward Don restaurant equipment and supplies distribution business, our Asian specialty distribution company and a number of other small specialty businesses that are not material to the operations of Sysco;   \n•\nInternational Foodservice Operations\n – includes operations outside of the United States (U.S.), which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products. The Americas primarily consists of operations in Canada, Bahamas, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as our export operations that distribute to international customers. Our European operations primarily consist of operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Ireland and Sweden;\n•\nSYGMA\n – our U.S. customized distribution operations serving quick-service chain restaurant customer locations; and\n•\nOther\n – primarily our hotel supply operations, Guest Worldwide.\nWe estimate that we serve about 17% of an approximately $370 billion annual foodservice market in the U.S. based on industry data obtained from Technomic, Inc. (Technomic) as of the end of calendar year 2024. Technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately $382 billion by the end of calendar year 2025. From time to time, Technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and, as a result, our percentage can change not only from our sales results, but also from such revisions. We also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share.\nAccording to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-away-from-home, market represents approximately 56% of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the U.S. as of the end of calendar year 2024.\nHighlights\nOur fiscal 2025 results were driven by sales growth of 3.2% as compared to fiscal 2024. This growth was driven by inflation and volume growth, partially from recent acquisitions. Gross profit increased 2.5% as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily attributable to effective management of product cost inflation. Operating income decreased 3.6% as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to a noncash goodwill impairment charge in our Guest Worldwide business. Adjusted operating income increased 1.2% as compared to fiscal 2024. See below for a comparison of our fiscal 2025 results to our fiscal 2024 results, both including and excluding Certain Items (as defined below).\n    Below is a comparison of results from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2024:\n•\nSales:\n◦\nincreased 3.2%, or $2.5 billion, to $81.4 billion; \n•\nOperating income:\n◦\ndecreased 3.6%, or $114 million, to $3.1 billion;\n◦\nadjusted operating income increased 1.2%, or $42 million, to $3.5 billion; \n•\nNet earnings:\n◦\ndecreased 6.5%, or $127 million, to $1.8 billion;\n◦\nadjusted net earnings increased 0.8%, or $17 million, to $2.2 billion; \n•\nBasic earnings per share:\n◦\ndecreased 4.1%, or $0.16, to $3.74 from the comparable prior year amount of $3.90 per share;\n•\nDiluted earnings per share:\n◦\ndecreased 4.1%, or $0.16, to $3.73 from the comparable prior year amount of $3.89 per share;\n◦\nadjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.46 in fiscal 2025, a $0.15 increase from the comparable prior year amount of $4.31 per share; \n•\nEBITDA:\n◦\ndecreased 1.2%, or $50 million, to $4.0 billion; and\n◦\nadjusted EBITDA increased 2.4%, or $101 million, to $4.3 billion. \nThe discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than EBITDA and free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove (1) restructuring charges; (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives; (3) severance charges; and (4) acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions. \n27\nFiscal 2025 results of operations were also negatively impacted by a noncash goodwill impairment charge. No similar charge was applicable in fiscal 2024.\nThe fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 items discussed above are collectively referred to as “Certain Items.” The results of our operations can be impacted by changes in exchange rates applicable to converting from local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our results on a constant currency basis. Our discussion below of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from Certain Items, and certain metrics are stated on a constant currency basis.\nManagement believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, other (income) expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results. Additionally, it provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations, (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis and (3) removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that, as a result, are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity.\nThe company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Any metric within this section referred to as “adjusted” will reflect the applicable impact of Certain Items. More information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to GAAP numbers can be found under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”\nKey Performance Indicators\nSysco seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive stakeholder value through sales growth and capital allocation and deployment. We believe the following are our most significant performance metrics in our current business environment: \n•\nAdjusted operating income growth (non-GAAP); \n•\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share growth (non-GAAP); \n•\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP);\n•\nCase volume growth for U.S. Foodservice and International Foodservice operations;\n•\nSysco brand penetration for U.S. Broadline operations; and\n•\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP).\nWe use these financial metrics and related computations, as well as sales and gross profit growth, to evaluate our business and to plan for near and long-term operating and strategic decisions. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. \nKey Financial Definitions\n \n•\nSales – Sales are equal to gross sales subtracted by, (1) sales returns and (2) sales incentives that we offer to certain customers, such as upfront monies and discounts. Our sales are driven by changes in case volumes and product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products and mix of products sold.\n•\nGross profit – Gross profit is equal to our net sales subtracted by our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration) and inbound freight. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes.\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share Growth\nAdjusted operating income represents our consolidated operating income, adjusted for the impact of Certain Items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share represents our consolidated diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the impact of Certain Items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. Sysco’s management considers growth in these metrics to be useful measures of operating efficiency and profitability as they facilitate comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business.\n28\nAdjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net earnings plus: (1) interest expense, (2) income tax expense and benefit, (3) depreciation and (4) amortization. The net earnings component of our EBITDA calculation is impacted by Certain Items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. As a result, in the non-GAAP reconciliations below for each period presented, adjusted EBITDA is computed as EBITDA plus the impact of Certain Items, excluding Certain Items related to interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Sysco’s management considers growth in this metric to be a measure of overall financial performance that provides useful information to management and investors about the profitability of the business. It facilitates comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Additionally, it is a commonly used component metric used to inform on capital structure decisions.\nCase Volume Growth for U.S. Foodservice and International Foodservice Operations\nCase volume represents the volume of products sold to customers during a period of time and improvements in this metric are a primary driver of Sysco’s top line performance. We define a case as the lowest level of packaged products that are sold from our warehouses, with one case potentially containing several pieces of a product packaged in bulk. Case size does not generally vary by location or from period to period due to the design of our warehouses but can vary within our international operations. Case volume growth is calculated by dividing the change in the volume of cases sold year-over-year by the volume of cases sold in the prior year. Sysco management considers case volume growth within its U.S. Foodservice and International Foodservice operations to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating sales performance and as an indicator of gross margin performance. Management monitors case volume growth by customer type, with bifurcation between local customers and national customers, as this provides a measure of gross profit performance due to the pricing strategies attached to each customer type. Local customers are primarily street customers, such as independent restaurants that do not have long-term contracts, or locally managed customers, such as local chain restaurants, while national customers are the multi-unit customers requiring national coverage from a customer-centric view and are managed centrally from our Global Support Center, specific to U.S. Foodservice. Sysco management seeks to drive higher case volume growth to local customers, which allows more favorable pricing terms for these operations and generates higher gross margins as a result. National customers benefit from purchasing power as they are able to negotiate pricing agreements across multiple businesses reducing our gross profit potential, but reducing our overall cost per case, as national customers have bigger drop sizes. While overall case volume growth reflects a key component of sales growth, local customer case growth provides additional context around gross profit performance.\nSysco Brand Penetration for U.S. Broadline Operations\nSysco management considers Sysco brand penetration to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the gross profit performance of the company’s U.S. Broadline operations. Sysco offers an assortment of Sysco-branded products which are differentiated from privately branded products. These Sysco Branded products enable us to achieve higher gross margin by administering and leveraging a consolidated product procurement program for quality food and non-food products. Due to cost efficiencies, Sysco-branded products generate a higher gross margin than sales from other privately branded products. We define Sysco brand penetration as the percentage of Sysco-branded case volume sold to U.S. Broadline customers over all cases sold to U.S. Broadline customers. It is calculated by dividing Sysco-branded case volume sold to U.S. Broadline customers by total cases sold to U.S. Broadline customers. This performance indicator, also measured at the customer type level, including local and national customers, is driven by growth in the distribution of Sysco branded products to more customers and more geographies, as well as increasing Sysco branded offerings through innovation and the launch of new products.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities, subtracted by purchases of plant and equipment, added to proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. Sysco management considers free cash flow to be a non-GAAP liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See “Liquidity and \n29\nCapital Resources” for discussions of GAAP metrics, including net cash provided by operating activities and our reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure. \nTrends\nEconomic and Industry Trends\n \nDuring fiscal 2025, Sysco was impacted by negative year-over-year foot traffic to restaurants. Foot traffic trends improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. We expect foot traffic in fiscal 2026 to be similar to foot traffic trends in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. We believe the food-away-from-home sector is a healthy long-term growth market, and Sysco is diversified and well positioned as a market leader in food service. \nSales and Gross Profit Trends\nOur sales and gross profit performance are influenced by multiple factors including price, volume, inflation, customer mix and product mix. The most significant factor affecting our sales and gross profit performance in fiscal 2025 was product cost inflation, as we experienced 2.5% inflation at the total enterprise level. U.S. Foodservice experienced a 0.5% improvement in total case volume and a 1.4% decrease in local case volume as compared to fiscal 2024. This volume reflects our broadline and specialty businesses, except for our specialty meats business, which measures its volume in pounds. We experienced growth in local case volume in our International Foodservice segment of approximately 4.0% in fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024.\nWe experienced inflation at a rate of 3.5% and 2.5% in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2025, respectively, at the total enterprise level, primarily driven by inflation in the dairy, poultry, and meat categories. We have been successful in managing inflation, resulting in an increase in gross profit dollars. Gross margin decreased 13 basis points in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily as a result of a shift in our customer mix driven by national sales volumes outpacing local sales volumes and a decrease in Sysco brand penetration rates. Gross margin increased 19 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily as a result of disciplined strategic sourcing efforts.\nWe expect to grow our revenue and earnings in fiscal 2026. We expect the rate of inflation for fiscal 2026 to be approximately 2%, which is consistent with recent trends experienced in fiscal 2025. We also expect volume growth in fiscal 2026 as a result of improved sales consultant retention, increased sales consultant tenure, and from contributions from potential mergers and acquisitions. In total, we expect these factors to result in net sales growth across the enterprise of 3% to 5% in fiscal 2026.\nOperating Expense Trends\nTotal operating expenses increased 4.2% during fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, driven by business and sales headcount investments, cost inflation, as well as a noncash impairment charge on our Guest Worldwide business. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation as our operating results were lower than our target payout criteria. Our Global Support Center expenses experienced a decrease of 5.7% in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily as a result of progress on our existing cost savings program.\nIn fiscal 2026, we expect to achieve target operating results thereby increasing our incentive compensation by approximately $100 million compared to fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2026, we expect to achieve cost savings benefits as we leverage our unique scale advantages to expand strategic sourcing efforts to include a broader range of categories, more efficiently harness our global buying power, improve inbound freight logistics to minimize points across our network, and take actions to improve organizational optimization at our Global Support Center. We believe the advancements that have been made in our physical capabilities, and the investments made to improve training, will result in continued supply chain productivity improvements and in lowered costs to serve our customers.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn our annual fiscal 2025 goodwill impairment assessment, we concluded that one reporting unit, Guest Worldwide, had a fair value that was less than book value due to its recent financial performance and downward revisions in its long-range financial outlook. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $92 million for a portion of the goodwill attributable to our Guest Worldwide reporting unit. This charge is included within operating \n30\nexpenses in the consolidated results of operations. All other reporting units were concluded to have a fair value that exceeded book value. We do not anticipate to incur additional goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2026.\nIncome Tax Trends\nOur provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases or decreases in book versus tax basis differences, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 was 24.3% and is expected to be approximately 23.5% to 24.0% in fiscal 2026.\nOn July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the legislation commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The OBBBA includes various provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. Certain provisions will be effective for Sysco beginning in our fiscal 2026 tax year. We are currently evaluating the future impact of these tax law changes on our financial statements.\nDivestitures\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we sold our interest in our joint venture partnership in Mexico, which was a part of our International Foodservice Operations. This operation was not significant to Sysco’s business, and the divestiture will facilitate our efforts to improve our return on invested capital position.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nWe continue to focus on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our growth strategy. Our strategy is to grow our existing businesses, while cultivating new channels, new business lines and new capabilities. \nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we acquired Campbells Prime Meat, a leading specialty meat business based in Scotland. By combining the Campbells Prime Meat product offering with our broadline business, this acquisition provides a strategic opportunity to enable total team selling in this region. This company’s results are included within International Foodservice Operations and were not material to our results in fiscal 2025.\nStrategy \nOur purpose is “Connecting the World to Share Food and Care for One Another.” Purpose driven companies are believed to perform better, and we believe our purpose will assist us to grow substantially faster than the foodservice distribution industry and deliver profitable growth through our “Recipe for Growth” transformation. This growth transformation is supported by strategic pillars that we believe will continue to enable us to better serve our customers, including: \n•\nDigital\n – We have and will continue to enrich the customer experience through personalized digital tools that reduce friction in the purchase experience and introduce innovation to our customers.\n•\nProducts and Solutions\n – We are providing customer-focused marketing and merchandising solutions that inspire increased sales of our broad assortment of fair priced products and services. We continue to improve our merchandising strategies globally to secure the best possible cost for our customers.\n•\nSupply Chain\n – We are efficiently and consistently serving customers with the products they need, when and how they need them, through a flexible delivery framework. We are developing a more nimble, accessible and productive supply chain that is better positioned to support our customers.\n•\nCustomer Teams\n – Our greatest strength is our people - people who are passionate about food and food service. Our team - diverse in perspectives, backgrounds, and life experiences - delivers expertise and differentiated services designed to help our customers grow their businesses. We will continue to invest in the sales organization through incremental sales colleagues and intend to improve the effectiveness by leveraging data to increase the yield of the sales process.\n31\n•\nFuture Horizons\n – We are committed to responsible growth. We will cultivate new channels, new segments, and new capabilities, organically and through strategic acquisitions, while being stewards of our company and our planet for the long term. We will utilize cost-out and efficiency improvements to mitigate the costs of our future investments.\nResults\n \nof Operations\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated:\n \n2025\n2024\nSales\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales\n81.6 \n81.5 \nGross profit\n18.4 \n18.5 \nOperating expenses\n14.6 \n14.5 \nOperating income\n3.8 \n4.0 \nInterest expense\n0.8 \n0.7 \nOther expense (income), net\n— \n— \nEarnings before income taxes\n3.0 \n3.3 \nIncome taxes\n0.8 \n0.8 \nNet earnings\n2.2 \n%\n2.5 \n%\nThe following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year:\n \n2025\nSales\n3.2 \n%\nCost of sales\n3.4 \nGross profit\n2.5 \nOperating expenses\n4.2 \nOperating income\n(3.6)\nInterest expense\n4.6 \nOther expense (income), net \n(1)\n26.7 \nEarnings before income taxes\n(5.8)\nIncome taxes\n(3.8)\nNet earnings\n(6.5)\n%\nBasic earnings per share\n(4.1)\n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n(4.1)\nAverage shares outstanding\n(2.6)\nDiluted shares outstanding\n(2.6)\n(1)\nOther expense (income), net was expense of $38 million in fiscal 2025 and expense of $30 million in fiscal 2024.\n32\nSegment Results  \nThe following represents our results by reportable segments:\n \nYear Ended Jun. 28, 2025\n \nU.S. Foodservice Operations\nInternational Foodservice Operations\nSYGMA\nOther\nGlobal Support Center\nConsolidated\nTotals\n \n(In millions)\nSales\n$\n56,965 \n$\n14,905 \n$\n8,410 \n$\n1,090 \n$\n— \n$\n81,370 \nSales increase (decrease)\n2.9 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n8.3 \n%\n(7.3)\n%\n3.2 \n%\nPercentage of total\n70.0 \n%\n18.3 \n%\n10.3 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n3,516 \n$\n437 \n$\n81 \n$\n(73)\n$\n(873)\n$\n3,088 \nOperating income increase (decrease)\n(4.3)\n%\n16.5 \n%\n12.5 \n%\n(282.5)\n%\n(3.6)\n%\nPercentage of total segments \n88.8 \n%\n11.0 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n(1.8)\n%\n100.0 \n%\nOperating income as a percentage of sales\n6.2 \n%\n2.9 \n%\n1.0 \n%\n(6.7)\n%\n3.8 \n%\n \nYear Ended Jun. 29, 2024\n \nU.S. Foodservice Operations\nInternational Foodservice Operations\nSYGMA\nOther\nGlobal Support Center\nConsolidated\nTotals\n \n(In millions)\nSales\n$\n55,339 \n$\n14,561 \n$\n7,768 \n$\n1,176 \n$\n— \n$\n78,844 \nPercentage of total\n70.2 \n%\n18.5 \n%\n9.9 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n3,673 \n$\n375 \n$\n72 \n$\n40 \n$\n(958)\n$\n3,202 \nPercentage of total segments\n88.3 \n%\n9.0 \n%\n1.7 \n%\n1.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nOperating income as a percentage of sales\n6.6 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n0.9 \n%\n3.4 \n%\n4.1 \n%\nOur U.S. Foodservice Operations and our International Foodservice Operations segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments. In fiscal 2025, U.S. Foodservice Operations and International Foodservice Operations represented approximately 70.0% and 18.3%, respectively, of Sysco’s overall sales, compared to 70.2% and 18.5%, respectively, in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, U.S. Foodservice Operations represented approximately 88.8% and 88.3%, respectively, of the total segment operating income. See Note 21, “Business Segment Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information.\nCost of sales primarily includes our product costs, net of vendor consideration, and includes in-bound freight. Operating expenses include the costs of facilities, product handling, delivery, selling and general and administrative activities. Fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit; fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses. Along with sales, operating income is the most relevant measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources, as operating income includes cost of goods sold in addition to the costs to warehouse and deliver goods, which are significant and relevant costs when evaluating a distribution business.\nResults of U.S. Foodservice Operations\nIn fiscal 2025, the U.S. Foodservice Operations operating results represented approximately 70.0% of Sysco’s overall sales and 88.8% of the aggregated operating income of Sysco’s reporting segments. Several factors contributed to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments. We have invested substantial amounts in assets, operating methods, technology and management expertise in this segment. The breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations.\n33\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year:\n \n2025\n2024\nChange in Dollars\n % Change\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nSales\n$\n56,965 \n$\n55,339 \n$\n1,626 \n2.9 \n%\nGross profit\n10,875 \n10,708 \n167 \n1.6 \nOperating expenses\n7,359 \n7,035 \n324 \n4.6 \nOperating income\n$\n3,516 \n$\n3,673 \n$\n(157)\n(4.3)\n%\nGross profit\n$\n10,875 \n$\n10,708 \n$\n167 \n1.6 \n%\nAdjusted operating expenses (Non-GAAP) \n(1)\n7,243 \n6,964 \n279 \n4.0 \nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) \n(1)\n$\n3,632 \n$\n3,744 \n$\n(112)\n(3.0)\n%\n(1)\nSee “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” below.\nSales\nThe following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the prior year in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change.\nIncrease (Decrease)\n2025\n(Dollars in millions)\nCause of change\nPercentage\nDollars\nCase volume \n(1)\n0.4 \n%\n$\n201 \nInflation\n2.6 \n1,460 \nOther \n(2)\n(0.1)\n(35)\nTotal change in sales\n2.9 \n%\n$\n1,626 \n(1)\nCase volumes increased 0.5% compared to fiscal 2024.

Any impact in volumes from our specialty meats operations is included within “Other.”\nThe sales growth in our U.S. Foodservice Operations was driven by higher inflation in fiscal 2025. Case volumes from our U.S. Foodservice Operations increased 0.5%, as compared to fiscal 2024. This included a 1.4% decrease in local customer case volume as compared to fiscal 2024.\nOperating Income\nThe decrease in operating income for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, was driven by increases in operating expenses, partially offset by gross profit dollar growth and case volume growth.\nGross profit dollar growth in fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by disciplined strategic sourcing efforts and case volume growth from recent acquisitions. The estimated change in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, increased in fiscal 2025. For fiscal 2025, this change in product costs was primarily driven by inflation in the dairy and poultry categories. Sysco brand penetration for U.S. Broadline decreased by 81 basis points to 35.8% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024. Specific to local customers, Sysco brand penetration for U.S. Broadline decreased by 81 basis points to 46.2% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024. \nGross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of sales, was 19.1% in fiscal 2025. This was a decrease of 26 basis points compared to gross margin of 19.4% in fiscal 2024, primarily due to a shift in our customer mix driven by national sales volumes outpacing local sales volume and a decrease in Sysco brand penetration rates.\n34\nThe increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, was primarily driven by cost inflation and increases in colleague-related costs, depreciation expense, and bad debt, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and gains from sale leaseback transactions. \nResults of International Foodservice Operations\nIn fiscal 2025, the International Foodservice Operations operating results represented approximately 18.3% of Sysco’s overall sales. \nThe following table sets forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year:\n \n2025\n2024\nChange in Dollars\n % Change\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nSales\n$\n14,905 \n$\n14,561 \n$\n344 \n2.4 \n%\nGross profit\n3,109 \n2,947 \n162 \n5.5 \nOperating expenses\n2,672 \n2,572 \n100 \n3.9 \nOperating income\n$\n437 \n$\n375 \n$\n62 \n16.5 \n%\nGross profit\n$\n3,109 \n$\n2,947 \n$\n162 \n5.5 \n%\nAdjusted operating expenses (Non-GAAP) \n(1)\n2,524 \n2,455 \n69 \n2.8 \nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) \n(1)\n$\n585 \n$\n492 \n$\n93 \n18.9 \n%\nComparable sales using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) \n(1)\n$\n14,934 \n$\n14,561 \n$\n373 \n2.6 \n%\nComparable gross profit using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) \n(1)\n3,098 \n2,947 \n151 \n5.1 \nComparable operating expenses adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) \n(1)\n2,513 \n2,455 \n58 \n2.4 \nComparable operating income adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) \n(1)\n$\n585 \n$\n492 \n$\n93 \n18.9 \n%\n(1)\nSee “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” below.\nSales\nThe following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change.\nIncrease (Decrease)\n2025\n(Dollars in millions)\nCause of change\nPercentage\nDollars\nInflation\n2.1 \n%\n$\n302 \nForeign currency\n(0.2)\n(29)\nCase growth\n1.7 \n241 \nImpact of divestiture\n(2.4)\n(329)\nOther\n1.2 \n159 \nTotal change in sales\n2.4 \n%\n$\n344 \nSales increased 2.4% in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher inflation and local case growth. Excluding the impact of the Mexico joint venture, which was divested during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, sales increased 4.8% in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\n35\nOperating Income\nThe $62 million increase in operating income for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, was primarily due to growth in local case volumes, success in our strategic sourcing program, and positive contributions from our recent mergers and acquisitions efforts.\nThe increase in gross profit dollars in fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, was primarily attributable to increases in local case volumes. Local case volumes increased approximately 4.0% in fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024.\nThe increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, was primarily due to increases in colleague-related costs and depreciation expense. \nResults of SYGMA and Other Segment\nOur SYGMA segment sales were 8.3% higher in fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily driven by the growth of new customers. Operating income increased by $9 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to the growth of new customers and productivity improvements. We expect SYGMA’s sales growth rates to moderate in fiscal 2026 as we reach the one-year anniversary mark of fiscal 2025’s substantial customer additions.\nFor the operations that are grouped within our Other segment, sales were 7.3% lower in fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024. Operating income decreased $113 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024. The operations of this group mainly consist of our hospitality business, Guest Worldwide. In fiscal 2025, a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $92 million was recorded within operating expenses for a portion of the goodwill attributable to our Guest Worldwide reporting unit. This impairment charge is considered a Certain Item (defined above). We do not expect a similar impairment charge in fiscal 2026 and as a result, are expecting improved operating results within our Other segment in fiscal 2026.\nGlobal Support Center Expenses\nOur Global Support Center generally includes all expenses of the corporate office and Sysco’s shared service operations. These expenses decreased $56 million in fiscal 2025, or 5.7% as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreases in colleague-related costs, including lower incentive compensation.\nIncluded in Global Support Center expenses are Certain Items that totaled $79 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $81 million in fiscal 2024. Certain Items impacting fiscal 2025 were primarily expenses associated with severances, our business technology transformation initiatives, and expenses associated with acquisitions. In fiscal 2024, Certain Items that impacted the year were primarily expenses associated with severances, our business technology transformation initiatives, and expenses associated with acquisitions.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $28 million for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to interest on new senior notes issued. We expect to incur $700 million in interest expense in fiscal 2026.\nNet Earnings\nNet earnings decreased 6.5% in fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, due primarily to the items noted previously for operating income and interest expense, as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in Note 19, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Adjusted net earnings, excluding Certain Items, increased 0.8% in fiscal 2025, primarily due to an increase in sales volume as a result of recent acquisitions and disciplined strategic sourcing efforts.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share in fiscal 2025 were $3.74, a 4.1% decrease from the fiscal 2024 amount of $3.90 per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2025 were $3.73, a 4.1% decrease from the fiscal 2024 amount of $3.89 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding Certain Items (which is a non-GAAP financial measure for which a reconciliation is \n36\nprovided in “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” on the subsequent page), in fiscal 2025 were $4.46, a 3.5% increase from the fiscal 2024 amount of $4.31 per share. These results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed previously related to net earnings in fiscal 2025. \n37\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThe discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than EBITDA and free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove (1) restructuring charges; (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives; (3) severance charges; and (4) acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions. Adjustments provided herein for fiscal 2025 results of operations also remove the impact of a goodwill impairment charge. No similar charge was applicable in fiscal 2024.\nThe results of our operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. We also measure our sales growth excluding the impact of our joint venture in Mexico which was divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nManagement believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items, presenting its results on a constant currency basis, and adjusting its sales results to exclude the impact of its joint venture in Mexico provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results. It provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis.\nSysco has a history of growth through acquisitions and excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, acquisition costs and due diligence costs for those acquisitions. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results for fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024.\nSet forth on the following page is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not be equal to the total presented when added due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.\n38\n \n2025\n2024\nChange in Dollars\n%/bps \nChange\n \n(In millions, except for share and per share data)\nSales (GAAP)\n$\n81,370 \n$\n78,844 \n$\n2,526 \n3.2 \n%\nImpact of Mexico joint venture sales\n(207)\n(536)\n329 \n0.4 \nComparable sales excluding Mexico joint venture (Non-GAAP)\n$\n81,163 \n$\n78,308 \n$\n2,855 \n3.6 \n%\nSales (GAAP)\n$\n81,370 \n$\n78,844 \n$\n2,526 \n3.2 \n%\nImpact of currency fluctuations \n(1)\n33 \n33 \n— \nComparable sales using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)\n$\n81,403 \n$\n78,844 \n$\n2,559 \n3.2 \n%\nCost of sales (GAAP)\n$\n66,401 \n$\n64,236 \n$\n2,165 \n3.4 \n%\nGross profit (GAAP)\n$\n14,969 \n$\n14,608 \n$\n361 \n2.5 \n%\nImpact of currency fluctuations \n(1)\n(10)\n(10)\n(0.1)\nComparable gross profit adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)\n$\n14,959 \n$\n14,608 \n$\n351 \n2.4 \n%\nGross margin (GAAP)\n18.40 \n%\n18.53 \n%\n-13 bps\nImpact of currency fluctuations \n(1)\n(0.02)\n-2 bps\nComparable gross margin adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)\n18.38 \n%\n18.53 \n%\n-15 bps\nOperating expenses (GAAP)\n$\n11,881 \n$\n11,406 \n$\n475 \n4.2 \n%\nImpact of restructuring and transformational project costs \n(2)\n(183)\n(120)\n(63)\n(52.5)\nImpact of acquisition-related costs \n(3)\n(160)\n(159)\n(1)\n(0.6)\nImpact of goodwill impairment\n(92)\n— \n(92)\nNM\nOperating expenses adjusted for Certain Items (Non-GAAP)\n11,446 \n11,127 \n319 \n2.9 \nImpact of currency fluctuations \n(1)\n(11)\n(11)\n(0.1)\nComparable operating expenses adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)\n$\n11,435 \n$\n11,127 \n$\n308 \n2.8 \n%\nOperating expense as a percentage of sales (GAAP)\n14.60 \n%\n14.47 \n%\n13 bps\nImpact of certain item adjustments\n(0.53)\n(0.36)\n-17 bps\nAdjusted operating expense as a percentage of sales (Non-GAAP)\n14.07 \n%\n14.11 \n%\n-4 bps\nOperating income (GAAP)\n$\n3,088 \n$\n3,202 \n$\n(114)\n(3.6)\n%\nImpact of restructuring and transformational project costs \n(2)\n183 \n120 \n63 \n52.5 \nImpact of acquisition-related costs \n(3)\n160 \n159 \n1 \n0.6 \nImpact of goodwill impairment\n92 \n— \n92 \nNM\nOperating income adjusted for Certain Items (Non-GAAP)\n3,523 \n3,481 \n42 \n1.2 \nImpact of currency fluctuations \n(1)\n2 \n2 \n0.1 \nComparable operating income adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)\n$\n3,525 \n$\n3,481 \n$\n44 \n1.3 \n%\nOperating margin (GAAP)\n3.80 \n%\n4.06 \n%\n-26 bps\nOperating margin adjusted for Certain Items (Non-GAAP)\n4.33 \n%\n4.42 \n%\n-9 bps\nOperating margin adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)\n4.33 \n%\n4.42 \n%\n-9 bps\nNet earnings (GAAP)\n$\n1,828 \n$\n1,955 \n$\n(127)\n(6.5)\n%\nImpact of restructuring and transformational project costs \n(2)\n183 \n120 \n63 \n52.5 \nImpact of acquisition-related costs \n(3)\n160 \n159 \n1 \n0.6 \nImpact of goodwill impairment\n92 \n— \n92 \nNM\nTax impact of restructuring and transformational project costs \n(4)\n(42)\n(29)\n(13)\n(44.8)\nTax impact of acquisition-related costs \n(4)\n(37)\n(38)\n1 \n2.6 \n39\n \n2025\n2024\nChange in Dollars\n%/bps \nChange\n \n(In millions, except for share and per share data)\nTax impact of goodwill impairment \n(4)\n(10)\n— \n(10)\nNM\nImpact of other non-routine tax adjustments\n10 \n— \n10 \nNM\nNet earnings adjusted for Certain Items (Non-GAAP)\n$\n2,184 \n$\n2,167 \n$\n17 \n0.8 \n%\nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP)\n$\n3.73 \n$\n3.89 \n$\n(0.16)\n(4.1)\n%\nImpact of restructuring and transformational project costs \n(2)\n0.37 \n0.24 \n0.13 \n54.2 \nImpact of acquisition-related costs \n(3)\n0.33 \n0.32 \n0.01 \n3.1 \nImpact of goodwill impairment\n0.19 \n— \n0.19 \nNM\nTax impact of restructuring and transformational project costs \n(4)\n(0.09)\n(0.06)\n(0.03)\n(50.0)\nTax impact of acquisition-related costs \n(4)\n(0.08)\n(0.08)\n— \n— \nTax impact of goodwill impairment \n(4)\n(0.02)\n— \n(0.02)\nNM\nImpact of other non-routine tax adjustments\n0.02 \n— \n0.02 \nNM\nDiluted earnings per share adjusted for Certain Items (Non-GAAP) \n(5)\n$\n4.46 \n$\n4.31 \n$\n0.15 \n3.5 \n%\nDiluted shares outstanding\n489,825,648\n503,096,086\n(1)\nRepresents a constant currency adjustment which eliminates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the current year results. \n(2)\nFiscal 2025 includes $57 million related to restructuring and severance charges and $126 million related to various transformation initiative costs, primarily consisting of supply chain transformation costs and changes to our business technology strategy.

There were $200 million in commercial paper amounts outstanding as of the end of fiscal 2024.\nAs of June 28, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding under our long-term revolving credit facility and the company had approximately $3.8 billion in cash and available liquidity. As of August 5, 2025, the company had approximately $2.7 billion in cash and available liquidity. \nSources and Uses of Cash\nSysco generates cash in the U.S. and internationally. Sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business; these investments are funded primarily by cash from operations and, to a lesser extent, external borrowings. Traditionally, our operations have produced significant cash flow and, due to our strong financial position, we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access capital markets, as needed. Cash generated from operations is generally allocated to:\n•\nworking capital investments;\n•\ncapital investments in facilities, systems, fleet, other equipment and technology;\n•\nacquisitions consistent with our growth strategy;\n•\ndebt repayments;\n•\ncash dividends; and\n•\nshare repurchases. \nAny remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high-quality, short-term instruments. As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses, and our overall capital structure. Any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage ratios and capital availability.\nWe continue to be in a strong financial position based on our balance sheet and operating cash flows; however, our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by macro-economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations. We believe our mechanisms to manage working capital, such as actively working with customers to receive payments on receivables, optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors, have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. We believe these mechanisms will continue to mitigate any unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations arising from macro-economic trends and conditions.\nWe extend credit terms to some of our customers based on our assessment of each customer’s creditworthiness. We monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary. In the ordinary course of business, customers periodically negotiate extended payment terms on trade accounts receivable. The company may utilize purchase arrangements with third-party financial institutions to transfer portions of our trade accounts receivable balance on a non-recourse basis in order to extend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow. The arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales. See Note 1, “Summary of Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.\nAs of June 28, 2025, we had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 64% of which was held by our international subsidiaries and generated from our earnings of international operations. If these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., such amounts may be subject to withholding and additional foreign tax obligations. \n44\nAdditionally, Sysco Corporation has provided intercompany loans to certain of its international subsidiaries. When interest and principal payments are made, some of this cash will move to the U.S.\nOur wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (the Captive) must maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to fund future reserve payments. As of June 28, 2025, the Captive held $132 million of fixed income marketable securities and $277 million of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in a restricted investment portfolio in order to meet solvency requirements. We purchased $32 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2025 and received $29 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities in the period.\nCash Requirements\nOur cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets.\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n•\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments \n– See Note 12, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further detail of our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments.\n•\nOperating and Finance Leases\n – See Note 13, “Leases,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n•\nDeferred Compensation\n – The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and Management Savings Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods. See Note 14, “Company-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n•\nPurchase and Other Obligations \n– Purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed, including minimum quantities resulting from our category management process. Such amounts are based on estimates. Purchase obligations also include amounts committed with various third-party service providers to provide information technology services and warehouse management services for periods up to fiscal 2036. See discussion under Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required.\n•\nOther Liabilities \n– These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of June 28, 2025, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n•\nContingent Consideration\n – Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only if certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved.\nWe believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes:\n•\nour cash flows from operations;\n•\nthe availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs, supported by our revolving credit facility; and\n•\nour ability to access capital from financial markets, including issuances of debt securities, either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC.\nDue to our strong financial position, we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and long-term capital markets if necessary.\n45\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nWe generated $2.5 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2025, compared to cash flows from operations of $3.0 billion in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, these amounts included year-over-year unfavorable comparisons on working capital of $317 million due to an unfavorable comparison on inventory and accounts receivable of $260 million and $96 million, respectively, partially offset by a favorable comparison on accounts payable of $39 million.  Income taxes negatively impacted cash flows from operations by $115 million, as estimated payments made were higher than in fiscal 2024.\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 capital expenditures included:\n•\nbuildings and building improvements; \n•\nfleet replacements; \n•\ninvestments in technology; and\n•\nwarehouse equipment.\nThe following table sets forth the company’s total plant and equipment additions:\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nNet cash capital expenditures\n$\n692 \n$\n753 \nPlant and equipment acquired through financing programs\n281 \n402 \nAssets obtained in exchange for finance lease obligations\n202 \n115 \nTotal net plant and equipment additions\n$\n1,175 \n$\n1,270 \nOur capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 were $74 million higher than in fiscal 2024, as we made investments to advance our Recipe for Growth strategy. We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 to be approximately $700 million. \nDuring fiscal 2025, we paid $40 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions. During fiscal 2024, we paid $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions. \nDuring fiscal 2025, we received $214 million in proceeds from sales of plant and equipment, which was primarily attributable to proceeds received from sale leaseback transactions. During fiscal 2024, we received $79 million in proceeds from sales of plant and equipment.\nFree Cash Flow\nOur free cash flow for fiscal 2025 decreased by $418 million, to $1.8 billion, as compared to fiscal 2024, principally as a result of a decrease in cash flows from operations, an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. \n46\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nFree cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. See “Key Performance Indicators” for further discussion regarding this non-GAAP financial measure. In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities.\n \n2025\n2024\nChange in Dollars\n% Change\n \n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)\n$\n2,510 \n$\n2,989 \n$\n(479)\n(16.0)\n%\nAdditions to plant and equipment\n(906)\n(832)\n(74)\n(8.9)\nProceeds from sales of plant and equipment\n214 \n79 \n135 \n170.9 \nFree Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)\n$\n1,818 \n$\n2,236 \n$\n(418)\n(18.7)\n%\nFinancing Activities\nEquity Transactions \nProceeds from exercises of share-based compensation awards were $110 million and $120 million in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. The level of option exercises, and thus proceeds, will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire.\nWe have traditionally engaged in share repurchase programs to allow Sysco to continue offsetting dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans and to make opportunistic repurchases. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of the company’s common stock which will remain available until fully utilized. We repurchased 16,988,703 shares for $1.3 billion during fiscal 2025. As of June 28, 2025, we had a remaining authorization of approximately $1.5 billion. We expect to complete approximately $1.0 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2026; however, this amount is subject to change based on economic conditions and the level of any acquisition activity in fiscal 2026. As of August 5, 2025, we have repurchased no additional shares under this authorization.\nWe have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company’s inception. Dividends paid in fiscal 2025 were $1.0 billion, or $2.04 per share, as compared to $1.0 billion, or $2.00 per share, in fiscal 2024. In April 2025, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 of $0.54 per share, representing an increase of $0.03 per share. This dividend was paid in July 2025. \nIn August 2024, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.\nIn November 2000, we filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 5, 2025, there were 29,477,835 shares remaining for issuance under this registration statement.\nDebt Activity and Borrowing Availability \nOur debt activity, including issuances and repayments, and our borrowing availability is described in Note 12, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our outstanding borrowings at June 28, 2025, and repayment activity since the end of fiscal 2025 are disclosed within those notes. Updated amounts at August 5, 2025, include:\n•\nNo outstanding borrowings from the long-term revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper programs;\n•\n$746 million outstanding borrowings under our U.S. commercial paper program; and\n•\n$341 million outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program in Europe.\n47\nOur aggregate commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 4.57% for fiscal 2025 and 5.49% for fiscal 2024.\nSenior notes classified within current maturities of long-term debt totaling $750 million will mature on October 1, 2025. Senior notes classified within long-term debt totaling $999 million will mature on July 15, 2026. We expect to fund the repayment of this debt using a combination of cash flows from operations and the proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt.\nThe availability of financing in the form of debt is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, free cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and economic and market conditions. As of August 5, 2025, Moody’s Investors Service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of Baa1 and a ratings outlook of “stable.” Standard & Poor’s has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of BBB and a ratings outlook of “stable.” Fitch Ratings Inc. has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of BBB and a ratings outlook of “stable.” A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets. As of August 5, 2025, the company had approximately $2.7 billion in cash and available liquidity. \nOur long-term revolving credit facility includes aggregate commitments of the lenders thereunder of $3.0 billion with an option to increase such commitments to $4.0 billion. The facility includes a covenant, among others, requiring Sysco to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0 over four consecutive fiscal quarters. The revolving credit facility expires on April 29, 2027. As of June 28, 2025, Sysco was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and the company expects to remain in compliance through the next twelve months.\nSysco’s U.S. commercial paper dealer agreement includes an issuance allowance for an aggregate amount not to exceed $3.0 billion. Our commercial paper dealer agreement in Europe includes an issuance allowance for an aggregate amount not to exceed €500 million. Any outstanding commercial paper balances are classified within long-term debt, as the programs are supported by the long-term revolving credit facility.\nGuarantor Summarized Financial Information \nOn January 19, 2011, the wholly owned U.S. Broadline subsidiaries of Sysco Corporation, which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products, entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and debentures of Sysco Corporation. A list of the current guarantors is included in Exhibit 22 to this Form 10-K. All subsequent issuances of senior notes and debentures in the U.S. and borrowings under the company’s $3.0 billion long-term revolving credit facility have also been guaranteed by these subsidiaries, as discussed in Note 12, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. As of June 28, 2025, Sysco had a total of $11.8 billion in senior notes, debentures and borrowings under the long-term revolving credit facility that were guaranteed by these subsidiary guarantors. Our remaining consolidated subsidiaries (non-guarantor subsidiaries) are not obligated under the senior notes indenture, debentures indenture or our long-term revolving credit facility.\nAll subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by the parent company, all guarantees are full and unconditional, and all guarantees are joint and several. The guarantees rank equally and ratably in right of payment with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the respective guarantors.\nThe assets of Sysco Corporation consist principally of the stock of its subsidiaries. Therefore, the rights of Sysco Corporation and the rights of its creditors to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation, recapitalization or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that claims of Sysco Corporation itself and/or the claims of those creditors themselves may be recognized as creditor claims of the subsidiary. Furthermore, the ability of Sysco Corporation to service its indebtedness and other obligations is dependent upon the earnings and cash flow of its subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment to it of such earnings or cash flow. If any of Sysco Corporation’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on its assets. Sysco Corporation’s rights and the rights of its creditors, including the rights of a holder of senior notes as an owner of debt securities, will be subject to that prior claim unless Sysco Corporation or such noteholder, if such noteholder’s debt securities are guaranteed by such subsidiary, also is a direct creditor of that subsidiary.\nThe guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor with respect to a series of senior notes or debentures may be released under certain customary circumstances. If we exercise our defeasance option with respect to the senior notes or debentures of any series, then any subsidiary guarantor effectively will be released with respect to that series. Further, each subsidiary guarantee \n48\nwill remain in full force and effect until the earliest to occur of the date, if any, on which (1) the applicable subsidiary guarantor shall consolidate with or merge into Sysco Corporation or any successor of Sysco Corporation or (2) Sysco Corporation or any successor of Sysco Corporation consolidates with or merges into the applicable subsidiary guarantor.\nBasis of Preparation of the Summarized Financial Information \nThe summarized financial information of Sysco Corporation (issuer), and certain wholly owned U.S. Broadline subsidiaries (guarantors) (together, the obligor group) is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the obligor group eliminated. Investments in and equity in the earnings of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, which are not members of the obligor group, have been excluded from the summarized financial information. The obligor group’s amounts due to, amounts due from and transactions with non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented in separate line items, if they are material to the obligor financials. The following table includes summarized financial information of the obligor group for the periods presented. \nCombined Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries Summarized Balance Sheet\nJun. 28, 2025\n(In millions)\nASSETS\nReceivables due from non-obligor subsidiaries\n$\n377 \nCurrent assets\n6,015 \nTotal current assets\n$\n6,392 \nNotes receivable from non-obligor subsidiaries \n$\n20 \nOther noncurrent assets\n5,211 \nTotal noncurrent assets\n$\n5,231 \nLIABILITIES\nPayables due to non-obligor subsidiaries \n$\n61 \nOther current liabilities \n3,214 \nTotal current liabilities\n$\n3,275 \nNotes payable to non-obligor subsidiaries\n$\n334 \nLong-term debt\n11,890 \nOther noncurrent liabilities\n1,538 \nTotal noncurrent liabilities\n$\n13,762 \nCombined Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries Summarized Results of Operations\n2025\n(In millions)\nSales\n$\n49,558 \nGross profit\n8,822 \nOperating income\n2,598 \nInterest expense from non-obligor subsidiaries\n32 \nNet earnings\n1,495 \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by Sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements.\n49\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting estimates pertain to the goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and company-sponsored pension plans.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. We use multiple valuation methods to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we generally use the income method which uses a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. More information on our acquisitions can be found in Note 4, “Acquisitions,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAnnually in our fiscal fourth quarter, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets. Impairment reviews, outside our annual review time frame, are performed if events or circumstances occur that include changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price. Our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment; however, if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (\ni.e.\n, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.\nWhen using a quantitative test, we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit. We use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant. The primary assumptions used in these various models include future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, working capital and capital expenditure requirements, along with earnings multiples of acquisitions completed by Sysco and those estimated of comparable acquisitions in the industry, including control premiums. When possible, we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units.\nCertain reporting units have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the U.S. Foodservice Operations, Canada Broadline or SYGMA reporting units. This is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired, and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the U.S. Foodservice Operations, Canadian Broadline and SYGMA reporting units. As such, these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn. Goodwill totals $3.1 billion for our U.S. Foodservice Operations, Canada Broadline and SYGMA reporting units, with $2.1 billion remaining for our other reporting units.\nIn our annual fiscal 2025 assessment, we concluded that one reporting unit, Guest Worldwide, had a fair value that was less than book value due to its recent financial performance and downward revisions in its long-range financial outlook. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $92 million for a portion of the goodwill attributable to our Guest Worldwide reporting unit. This charge is included within operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations. All other reporting units were concluded to have a fair value that exceeded book value.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models. For the purposes of the discounted cash flow models, fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate. Our fair value conclusions as of June 28, 2025 for the reporting units are sensitive to changes in the assumptions used in the income approach which include forecasted revenues and EBITDA, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management. Fair value of the reporting unit is, therefore, determined using significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We used recent historical performance, current forecasted financial information, and broad-based industry \n50\nand economic statistics as a basis to estimate the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model. These key assumptions are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of estimation and judgment and are subject to change based on actual results, industry and global economic and geo-political conditions, and the timing and success of the implementation of current strategic initiatives. The fair value estimates of two of our more significant reporting units, with total goodwill of $1.5 billion, are more sensitive to changes in significant assumptions, including changes in projected cash flows or weighted average cost of capital.\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases or decreases in book versus tax basis differences, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. Certain of our operations have carryforward attributes, such as operating losses. If these operations do not produce sufficient income, it could lead to the recognition of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the future if losses occur or growth is insufficient beyond our current expectations. This would negatively impact our income tax expense, net earnings, and balance sheet.\nOur liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Sysco received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service, mainly related to foreign tax credits generated in fiscal 2018 from repatriated earnings primarily from our Canadian operations. On April 18, 2023, during the company’s fourth fiscal quarter, the company filed suit in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the validity of certain tax regulations related to the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). The lawsuit seeks to have the court invalidate these regulations, which would affirm the company’s position regarding its foreign tax credits. Sysco previously recorded a benefit of $131 million attributable to its interpretation of the TCJA and the Internal Revenue Code. If the company is ultimately unsuccessful in defending its position, it may be required to reverse all, or some portion, of the benefit previously recorded.\nCompany-Sponsored Pension Plans\nAmounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Our U.S. Retirement Plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees. Our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) is frozen and is not open to any employees. None of these plans have a significant sensitivity to changes in discount rates s\npecific to our results of operations, but such changes could impact our balance sheet due to a change in our funded status. Due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans, our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is n\not a critical assumption.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 5.63% for fiscal 2025. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, historical returns of the major stock markets, and returns on alternative investments. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.\nThe expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. Retirement Plan is 5.70% for fiscal 2026. A 25 basis point increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return in the Plan for fiscal 2026 would decrease (increase) Sysco’s net company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2026 by approximately $6 million.\nPension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the Statement of Financial Position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as \n51\nof June 28, 2025 was a charge, net of tax, of $918 million. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of June 29, 2024 was a charge, net of tax, of $917 million.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
