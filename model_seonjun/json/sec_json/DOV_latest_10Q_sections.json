This increase was driven by acquisition-related revenue growth of 3.0%, a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1.3% and organic revenue growth of 0.5%. The acquisition-related growth was driven by our acquisitions in the Pumps & Process Solutions and Clean Energy & Fueling segments.\nThe 0.5% organic revenue growth for the third quarter of 2025 was driven by our Pumps & Process Solutions, Clean Energy & Fueling, and Imaging & Identification segments which grew 5.6%, 4.8%, and 3.0%, respectively. The growth was partially offset by the Engineered Products and Climate & Sustainability Technologies segments which declined 7.0% and 6.5%, respectively. For further information, see \"Segment Results of Operations\" within this Item 2.\n27\nTable of Contents\nFrom a geographic perspective, organic revenue for the U.S., our largest market, increased 1.6% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year comparable quarter, driven by increased organic revenue in the Pumps & Process Solutions and Clean Energy & Fueling segments. Organic revenue increased for Europe by 1.1%, and decreased for Other Americas and Asia by 6.5%, and 1.5%, respectively. \nBookings were $2.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $146.8 million or 7.9% compared to the prior year comparable quarter. The bookings growth was primarily driven by strong bookings in the Climate & Sustainability Technologies and Pumps & Process Solutions segments.\nRestructuring and other costs for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were $15.9 million, which included restructuring charges of $10.6 million and other costs of $5.3 million. Restructuring and other costs were primarily related to exit costs and headcount reductions in the Climate & Sustainability Technologies, Clean Energy & Fueling, and Pumps & Process Solutions segments. For further discussion related to our restructuring and other costs, see \"Restructuring and Other Costs (Benefits),\" within this Item 2.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company completed one business acquisition for approximately $11.4 million, subject to post-closing adjustments and inclusive of contingent consideration.

The increase in revenue was driven by acquisition-related growth of 3.0%, primarily in our Pumps & Process Solutions and Clean Energy & Fueling segments, a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1.3% and organic revenue growth of 0.5%. Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 2.1% in the third quarter of 2025 and by 1.6% in the prior year comparable quarter.\n28\nTable of Contents\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased $177.4 million, or 3.1%, from the prior year comparable period. The increase in revenue was driven by acquisition-related growth of 2.8%, primarily in our Pumps & Process Solutions and Clean Energy & Fueling segments, organic revenue growth of 0.6% and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.6%. This increase was partially offset by a disposition-related decline of 0.9%. Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 1.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and by 1.6% in the prior comparable period.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased $70.4 million, or 9.2%, and gross profit margin increased 160 basis points to 40.1%, versus the prior year comparable quarter. The gross profit margin increase was driven by productivity initiatives, favorable portfolio mix, positive price versus cost dynamics, and benefits from restructuring actions. \nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased $184.5 million, or 8.3%, and gross profit margin increased by 200 basis points to 40.0%, from the prior year comparable period. Gross profit margin increased driven by productivity initiatives, favorable portfolio mix, positive price versus cost dynamics, and benefits from restructuring actions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased $26.9 million, or 6.3%, from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits and acquisition-related amortization expense, partially offset by cost containment and productivity actions. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 30 basis points as compared to the prior year comparable quarter to 22.0%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased $67.7 million, or 5.2%, from the prior year comparable period, primarily due to increased employee compensation and benefits and acquisition-related amortization costs, partially offset by cost containment and productivity actions. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 40 basis points as compared to the prior year comparable period to 22.8%.\nResearch and development costs, including qualifying engineering costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to $43.5 million and $35.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and $121.8 million and $108.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. The costs as a percentage of revenue are 2.1% and 2.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 1.8% and 1.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nInterest Expense, net\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, interest expense, net of interest income, decreased $19.5 million, or 67.4%, to $9.4 million and $63.2 million or 71.1%, to $25.6 million, respectively compared to the prior year comparable period. The decreases were primarily driven by higher interest income generated by the investment of proceeds from the sale of ESG held in highly liquid short-term investments and reduced interest expense resulting from a lack of commercial paper borrowings.\nGain on Dispositions\nGain on dispositions amounted to $68.6 million\n \nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $4.6 million and $597.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The gain on dispositions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the sale of a minority owned equity investment on September 30, 2024. The gain on dispositions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the sale of the De-Sta-Co business on March 31, 2024 and the sale of a minority owned equity investment on September 30, 2024. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional details.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were 21.5% and 19.0%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 relative to the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to an internal reorganization in 2024. \nThe effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were 20.4% and 20.1%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 relative to the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to internal reorganizations in 2024. \nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill was enacted into law, introducing changes to the U.S. tax code, including making permanent certain provisions originally enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, such as 100% bonus depreciation and the immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs. The changes did not have a material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. \nThe Company is continuing to monitor the changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nSee Note 12 — Income Taxes in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional details.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations\nEarnings from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased 3.1% to $303.3 million, or $2.20 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, from $312.9 million, or $2.26 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, in the prior year comparable quarter. The decrease in earnings from continuing operations is primarily due to the after-tax gain on the sale of a minority owned equity investment realized in the prior year comparable quarter, partially offset by earnings growth in our Pumps & Process Solutions, Clean Energy & Fueling, Imaging & Identification, and Engineered Products segments. \nEarnings from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 decreased 29.2% to $822.7 million, or $5.96 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, from $1.2 billion, or $8.37 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, in the prior year comparable period. The decrease in earnings from continuing operations is primarily due to the after-tax gain on disposition of De-Sta-Co and a minority owned equity method investment totaling $464.2 million in the prior year, partially offset by higher operating earnings in the current period.\nDiscontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 amounted to $1.3 million and $10.8 million, respectively. Earnings from discontinued operations, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $34.2 million and $99.6 million, respectively. The Company completed the sale of ESG on October 8, 2024. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional details.\n30\nTable of Contents\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our five reportable operating segments (Engineered Products, Clean Energy & Fueling, Imaging & Identification, Pumps & Process Solutions, and Climate & Sustainability Technologies).\n Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple markets. We evaluate our operating segment performance based on segment earnings as defined in Note 16 — Segment Information in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\n \nWe report organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. See \"Non-GAAP Disclosures\" at the end of this Item 2.\nAdditionally, we use the following operational metrics in monitoring the performance of the business. We believe the operational metrics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in assessing the performance of our segments:\n•\nBookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period and exclude de-bookings related to orders received in prior periods, if any. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of order trends.\n•\nBook-to-bill is a ratio of the amount of bookings received from customers during a period divided by the amount of revenue recorded during that same period. This metric is a useful indicator of demand.\nEngineered Products\nOur Engineered Products segment provides a wide range of equipment, components, software, solutions and services to the vehicle aftermarket, aerospace and defense, industrial winch and hoist, and fluid dispensing end-markets. \n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\nRevenue\n$\n279,705 \n$\n296,117 \n(5.5)\n%\n$\n810,295 \n$\n914,234 \n(11.4)\n%\nSegment earnings\n$\n57,483\n$\n56,621 \n1.5 \n%\n$\n155,108 \n$\n171,248 \n(9.4)\n%\nSegment earnings margin\n20.6 %\n19.1 %\n19.1 %\n18.7 %\nOperational metrics:\nBookings\n$\n273,278 \n$\n284,823 \n(4.1)\n%\n$\n814,387 \n$\n895,290 \n(9.0)\n%\nComponents of revenue decline:\n \nOrganic decline\n \n \n(7.0)\n%\n(6.8)\n%\nAcquisitions\n \n \n0.4 \n%\n0.6 \n%\nDispositions\n— \n%\n(5.6)\n%\nForeign currency translation\n \n \n1.1 \n%\n0.4 \n%\nTotal revenue decline\n \n \n(5.5)\n%\n(11.4)\n%\nThird Quarter 2025 Compared to the Third Quarter 2024 \nEngineered Products revenue for the third quarter of 2025 decreased $16.4 million, or 5.5%, as compared to the third quarter of 2024, due to organic decline of 7.0%, partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1.1% and acquisition-related growth of 0.4%. Acquisition-related growth was driven by the acquisition of Criteria Labs, Inc. in the third quarter of 2024. Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 2.7% in the third quarter of 2025 and 1.1% in the prior year comparable quarter.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe organic revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes in our vehicle service business, partially offset by pricing actions and favorable demand trends in our aerospace and defense business. We expect year-over-year organic performance to improve in the fourth quarter with solid demand trends in our aerospace and defense business, as well as sequential improvement in vehicle service business demand.\nEngineered Products segment earnings increased $0.9 million, or 1.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by favorable price versus cost dynamics, productivity initiatives, and benefits from restructuring actions, partially offset by the negative impact from lower volumes in vehicle service. Segment earnings margin increased to 20.6% from 19.1% as compared to the prior year comparable quarter.\nOverall bookings decreased 4.1% as compared to the prior year comparable quarter. The bookings decline was due to reduced demand in our vehicle service business, partially offset by strength in aerospace and defense. Segment book-to-bill was 0.98.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 \nEngineered Products revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 decreased $103.9 million, or 11.4%, compared to the prior year comparable period. This was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6.8% and a disposition-related decline of 5.6%, partially offset by acquisition-related growth of 0.6% and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.4%. The organic revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes in our vehicle service business. Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 2.3% and by 0.8% in the prior year comparable period.\nSegment earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 decreased $16.1 million, or 9.4%, as compared to the 2024 comparable period. The decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of De-Sta-Co and lower volumes in vehicle service, partially offset by favorable price versus cost dynamics and the benefit of restructuring actions. Segment earnings margin increased to 19.1% from 18.7% as compared to the prior year comparable period.\nClean Energy & Fueling\nOur Clean Energy & Fueling segment provides components, equipment, software solutions and services enabling safe and reliable storage, transport, dispensing, and remote monitoring of traditional and clean fuels (including liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, and electric vehicle charging), cryogenic gases, and other hazardous substances along the supply chain, and safe and efficient operation of convenience retail, retail fueling and vehicle wash establishments. \n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\nRevenue\n$\n541,368 \n$\n500,685 \n8.1 \n%\n$\n1,578,613 \n$\n1,408,752 \n12.1 \n%\nSegment earnings\n$\n118,665 \n$\n99,536 \n19.2 \n%\n$\n312,080 \n$\n256,747 \n21.6 \n%\nSegment earnings margin\n21.9 %\n19.9 %\n19.8 %\n18.2 %\nOperational metrics:\nBookings\n$\n509,553 \n$\n507,329 \n0.4 \n%\n$\n1,580,231 \n$\n1,421,025 \n11.2 \n%\nComponents of revenue growth:\n \nOrganic growth\n \n \n4.8 \n%\n4.9 \n%\nAcquisitions\n \n \n2.9 \n%\n7.0 \n%\nForeign currency translation\n \n \n0.4 \n%\n0.2 \n%\nTotal revenue growth\n \n \n8.1 \n%\n12.1 \n%\n32\nTable of Contents\nThird Quarter 2025 Compared to the Third Quarter 2024 \nClean Energy & Fueling revenue for the third quarter of 2025 increased $40.7 million, or 8.1%, as compared to the third quarter of 2024, driven by organic growth of 4.8%, acquisition-related growth of 2.9% and a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 0.4%.

Significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table is derived from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nCash Flows from Operations \n(in thousands)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash flows provided by (used in):\n \n \nOperating activities\n$\n794,059 \n$\n648,881 \nInvesting activities\n(814,627)\n63,119 \nFinancing activities\n(280,347)\n(818,445)\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased by $145.2 million compared to September 30, 2024, primarily driven by higher operating earnings during the period. \nAdjusted Working Capital: \nWe believe adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as receivables, plus inventory, less accounts payable) provides a meaningful measure of liquidity by showing changes caused by operational results. \nThe following table provides a calculation of adjusted working capital:\nAdjusted Working Capital \n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nReceivables, net\n$\n1,451,935 \n$\n1,354,225 \nInventories, net\n1,321,751 \n1,144,838 \nLess: Accounts payable\n861,570 \n848,006 \nAdjusted working capital\n$\n1,912,116 \n$\n1,651,057 \nAdjusted working capital has increased by $261.1 million, or 15.8%, year-to-date, driven by an increase of $97.7 million in net receivables and an increase of $176.9 million in net inventory, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $13.6 million. These amounts include the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency translation. The increase in adjusted working capital versus year-end 2024 is primarily a result of timing of cash flows, with the fourth quarter traditionally representing our highest cash flow quarter. \nInvesting Activities\nCash flow from investing activities is derived from cash inflows from proceeds from dispositions, offset by cash outflows for acquisitions and capital expenditures. The majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following:\n•\nProceeds from dispositions: \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we received an additional $6.0 million of net proceeds related to the sale of a minority owned equity method investment in the third quarter of 2024 within the Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of $767.7 million from the disposition of De-Sta-Co. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. \n40\nTable of Contents\n•\nAcquisitions:\n During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we deployed approximately $663.2 million, net to acquire three\n \nbusinesses within the Pumps & Process Solutions segment and one business within the Clean Energy & Fueling segment. In comparison, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we deployed approximately $602.7 million, net to acquire seven businesses within the Clean Energy & Fueling and Imaging & Identification segments. See Note 3 — Acquisitions in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. \n•\nCapital spending:\n Capital expenditures increased $49.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in line with our planned capital expenditures for the year.\nWe anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make through the remainder of 2025 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, or by accessing the public debt or equity markets. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 to range from $190.0 million to $210.0 million. \nFinancing Activities\nCash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity. The majority of financing activity was attributed to the following: \n•\nRepurchase of common stock, including accelerated share repurchase program: \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company repurchased a total of 200,000 shares for $40.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used $500.0 million to repurchase 2,569,839 shares on March 1, 2024 under an accelerated share repurchase transaction. See Note 17 — Stockholders' Equity in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details.\n•\nCommercial paper and other short-term borrowings, net:\n The Company had no commercial paper borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $89.0 million to pay off commercial paper borrowings, with net proceeds received from the sale of De-Sta-Co. \n•\nDividend payments: \nTotal dividend payments to common shareholders were $213.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $212.4 million during the same period in 2024. Our dividends paid per common share increased 1.0% to $1.55 during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $1.54 during the same period in 2024.\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations\nNet cash (used in) provided by discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 amounted to $(11.3) million and $93.9 million, respectively. Cash flows from discontinued operations generated for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily relate to cash provided by operations of approximately $108.3 million, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $(14.4) million, which comprised capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from a sale of investment. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations equals free cash flow divided by earnings from continuing operations.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities:\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\nFree Cash Flow\n (dollars in thousands)\n2025\n2024\nCash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n794,059 \n$\n648,881 \nLess: Capital expenditures\n(163,274)\n(113,626)\nFree cash flow\n$\n630,785 \n$\n535,255 \nCash flow from operating activities as a percentage of revenue\n13.2 \n%\n11.2 \n%\nCash flow from operating activities as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations\n96.5 \n%\n55.9 \n%\nFree cash flow as a percentage of revenue\n10.5 \n%\n9.2 \n%\nFree cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations\n76.7 \n%\n46.1 \n%\n \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we generated free cash flow of $630.8 million, representing 10.5% of revenue and 76.7% of earnings from continuing operations. Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased $95.5 million, compared to September 30, 2024, primarily driven by higher operating earnings, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. The increases in cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow as percentages of earnings from continuing operations are due primarily to the gain on disposition of De-Sta-Co impacting the prior year. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details.\nCapitalization\nWe use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. As of September 30, 2025, we maintained $1.0 billion five-year and $500.0 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facilities (together, the \"Credit Agreements\") with a syndicate of banks which expire April 6, 2028 and April 2, 2026, respectively. The Company may elect to extend the maturity date of any loans under the 364-day credit facility until April 2, 2027, subject to conditions specified therein. The Credit Agreements are designated as a liquidity back-stop for the Company's commercial paper program and also are available for general corporate purposes.\nAt the Company's election, loans under the Credit Agreements will bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin. The Credit Agreements require the Company to pay facility fees and impose various restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, a requirement to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreements and other long-term debt covenants at September 30, 2025 and had an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of 109.8 to 1. We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants.\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nAt September 30, 2025, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.6 billion, of which approximately $567.9 million was held outside the United States. At December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, of which approximately $300.5 million was held outside the United States. Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks. We regularly hold cash in excess of near-term requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company completed four business acquisitions for total consideration of $665.2 million, subject to post-closing adjustments and inclusive of contingent consideration. See Note 3 — Acquisitions in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. The following table provides a calculation of net debt to net capitalization from the most directly comparable GAAP measures:\nNet Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio \n(dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and other short-term borrowings\n$\n400,646 \n$\n400,056 \nLong-term debt\n2,670,362 \n2,529,346 \nTotal debt\n3,071,008 \n2,929,402 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n(1,552,804)\n(1,844,877)\nNet debt\n1,518,204 \n1,084,525 \nAdd: Stockholders' equity\n7,662,936 \n6,953,996 \nNet capitalization\n$\n9,181,140 \n$\n8,038,521 \nNet debt to net capitalization\n16.5 \n%\n13.5 \n%\nOur net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 16.5% at September 30, 2025 compared to 13.5% at December 31, 2024. Net debt increased $433.7 million during the period primarily due to the increase in value of the euro-denominated debt resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from acquisition-related investments. Stockholders' equity increased for the period primarily driven by current earnings of $811.9 million. \nOperating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, purchase obligations, and lease obligations. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. \nWe believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of GAAP which requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Note 19 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. The adoption of recent accounting standards as included in Note 19 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the condensed consolidated financial statements has not had, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our revenue, earnings or liquidity.\n43\nTable of Contents\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, especially MD&A, contains \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. All statements in this document other than statements of historical fact are statements that are, or could be deemed, \"forward-looking\" statements. Some of these statements may be indicated by words such as \"may\", \"anticipate\", \"expect\", \"believe\", \"intend\", \"continue\", \"guidance\", \"estimates\", \"suggest\", \"will\", \"plan\", \"should\", \"would\", \"could\", \"forecast\" and other words and terms that use the future tense or have a similar meaning. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to numerous important risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things: general economic conditions and conditions in the particular markets in which we operate; supply chain constraints and labor shortages that could result in production stoppages, inflation in material input costs and freight logistics; the impacts of natural or human induced disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts, and public health crises or other future pandemics on the global economy and on our customers, suppliers, employees, business and cash flows; changes in customer demand and capital spending; competitive factors and pricing pressures; our ability to develop and launch new products in a cost-effective manner; changes in law, including the effect of tax laws and developments with respect to trade policy and tariffs; our ability to identify and complete acquisitions and integrate and realize synergies from newly acquired businesses; acquisition valuation levels; the impact of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; capital allocation plans and changes in those plans, including with respect to dividends, share repurchases, investments in research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions; our ability to effectively deploy capital resulting from dispositions; our ability to derive expected benefits from restructurings, productivity initiatives and other cost reduction actions; the impact of legal compliance risks and litigation, including with respect to product quality and safety, cybersecurity and privacy; and our ability to capture and protect intellectual property rights, and various other factors that are described in our periodic reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nThe Company may, from time to time, post financial or other information on its website, www.dovercorporation.com. The website is for informational purposes only and is not intended for use as a hyperlink. The Company is not incorporating any material on its website into this report.\nNon-GAAP Disclosures\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose non-GAAP information, which we believe provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, working capital or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \nWe believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow and free cash flow ratios provide both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase our common stock. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital provides a meaningful measure of liquidity by showing changes caused by operational results. We believe that reporting organic revenue growth provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.\nReconciliations and comparisons to non-GAAP measures can be found above in this Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
