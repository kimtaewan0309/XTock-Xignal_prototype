We\n \noffer innovative products and services in MedSurg,\n \nNeurotechnology, and Orthopaedics that help improve patient\n \nand healthcare outcomes. Alongside our customers around the\n \nworld, we impact more than 150 million patients annually.\nWe segregate our operations into two reportable business\n \nsegments: (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii)\n \nOrthopaedics. MedSurg and Neurotechnology products include\n \nsurgical equipment and navigation systems (Instruments),\n \nendoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy), patient\n \nhandling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care\n \ndisposable products (Medical), minimally invasive products for\n \nthe treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and\n \nvenous thromboembolism (Vascular), a comprehensive line of\n \nproducts for traditional brain and open skull based surgical\n \nprocedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including\n \nsynthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products\n \n(Neuro Cranial). Orthopaedics products consist primarily of\n \nimplants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and\n \nextremity surgeries.\nMacroeconomic Environment\nBeginning in 2025, the United States government has announced\n \nnew tariffs on goods imported into the United States from dozens\n \nof countries, including China and the European Union member\n \nstates. In response, governments have threatened or imposed\n \nreciprocal tariffs or taken other measures, and the United States\n \nis in the process of negotiating with certain governments. We\n \ncontinue to monitor and evaluate the situation. Tariffs are\n \nexpected to result in an increase in certain product costs or have\n \nadverse impacts on, among other things, demand for our\n \nproducts and supply chains. The overall macroeconomic and\n \ngeopolitical environment, including tariffs or changes in trade\n \npolicies, slower economic growth or recession, market volatility\n \nand inflation, and uncertainty regarding all of the foregoing, pose\n \nrisks that could impact our business and results of operations.\n \nFor more information about these risks, see Item 1A. \"Risk\n \nFactors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2024.\nOverview of the Three and \nNine Months\nIn the \nthree months 2025\n we achieved sales growth of \n10.3%\n \nfrom \n2024\n. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures,\n \nsales grew \n9.5%\n in constant currency. We reported operating\n \nincome margin of \n18.7%\n, net earnings of \n$859\n and net earnings\n \nper diluted share of \n$2.22\n. Excluding the impact of certain items,\n \nadjusted operating income margin\n(1)\n \nincreased\n by \n90\n basis points\n \nto \n25.6%\n, with adjusted net earnings\n(1)\n of \n$1,233\n and adjusted\n \nnet earnings per diluted share\n(1) \nof \n$3.19\n, an \nincrease\n of \n11.1%\n \nfrom \n2024\n.\n \nIn the \nnine months 2025\n we achieved sales growth of \n11.1%\n from\n \n2024\n. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales\n \ngrew \n10.0%\n in constant currency. We reported operating income\n \nmargin of \n17.2%\n, net earnings of \n$2,397\n and net earnings per\n \ndiluted share of \n$6.20\n. Excluding the impact of certain items,\n \nadjusted operating income margin\n(1)\n \nincreased\n by \n100\n basis\n \npoints to \n24.7%\n, with adjusted net earnings\n(1)\n of \n$3,541\n and\n \nadjusted net earnings per diluted share\n(1) \nof \n$9.16\n, an \nincrease\n of\n \n12.0%\n from \n2024\n.\n \nRecent Developments\n \nIn the first quarter \n2025\n we completed the acquisition of Inari for\n \ntotal consideration of \n$4,810\n, in upfront payments, net of cash\n \nacquired. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial\n \nStatements for further information.\nIn February 2025 we entered into a new revolving credit\n \nagreement that replaces our previous agreement dated October\n \n2021. The primary changes were to increase the aggregate\n \nprincipal amount of the facility by \n$750\n to $3,000 and extend the\n \nmaturity date to February 25, 2030. On \nSeptember 30, 2025\n \nthere were \nno\n borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit\n \nfacility or our commercial paper program which allows for\n \nmaturities up to \n397\n days from the date of issuance. The\n \nmaximum amount of our commercial paper that can be\n \noutstanding at any time is \n$3,000\n.\n \nIn February 2025 we issued \n$500\n of \n4.550%\n senior unsecured\n \nnotes due February 10, 2027, \n$700\n of \n4.700%\n senior unsecured\n \nnotes due February 10, 2028, \n$800\n of \n4.850%\n senior unsecured\n \nnotes due February 10, 2030 and \n$1,000\n of \n5.200%\n senior\n \nunsecured notes due February 10, 2035. In June \n2025\n we repaid\n \n$650M\n of \n1.150%\n senior unsecured notes.\n(1) \nRefer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a discussion of non-\nGAAP financial measures used in this report and a reconciliation to the\n \nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThree Months\nNine Months\nPercent Net \nSales\nPercentage\nPercent Net \nSales\nPercentage\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n6,057\n$\n5,494\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n10.3\n%\n$\n17,945\n$\n16,159\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n11.1\n%\nGross profit\n3,852\n3,517\n63.6\n64.0\n9.5\n11,437\n10,266\n63.7\n63.5\n11.4\nResearch, development and engineering expenses\n410\n377\n6.8\n6.9\n8.8\n1,222\n1,108\n6.8\n6.9\n10.3\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n2,045\n1,894\n33.8\n34.5\n8.0\n6,424\n5,562\n35.8\n34.4\n15.5\nAmortization of intangible assets\n189\n159\n3.1\n2.9\n18.9\n543\n467\n3.0\n2.9\n16.3\nGoodwill and other impairments\n73\n2\n1.2\n—\nnm\n163\n21\n0.9\n0.1\nnm\nOther income (expense), net\n(106)\n(42)\n(1.8)\n(0.8)\n152.4\n(276)\n(144)\n(1.5)\n(0.9)\n91.7\nIncome taxes\n170\n209\nnm\nnm\n(18.7)\n412\n517\nnm\nnm\n(20.3)\nNet earnings\n$\n859\n$\n834\n14.2\n%\n15.2\n%\n3.0\n%\n$\n2,397\n$\n2,447\n13.4\n%\n15.1\n%\n(2.0)\n%\nNet earnings per diluted share\n$\n2.22\n$\n2.16\n2.8\n%\n$\n6.20\n$\n6.35\n(2.4)\n%\nAdjusted net earnings per diluted share\n(1)\n$\n3.19\n$\n2.87\n11.1\n%\n$\n9.16\n$\n8.18\n12.0\n%\nnm - not meaningful\nDollar amounts are in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\n13\nSTRYKER CORPORATION\n2025\n \nThird Quarter\n Form 10-Q\nGeographic and Segment Net Sales\nThree Months\nNine Months\nPercentage Change\nPercentage Change\n2025\n2024\nAs \nReported\nConstant\nCurrency\n2025\n2024\nAs \nReported\nConstant\nCurrency\nGeographic:\nUnited States\n$\n4,571\n$\n4,109\n11.4\n%\n11.4\n%\n$\n13,565\n$\n12,070\n12.4\n%\n12.4\n%\nInternational\n1,486\n1,385\n6.9\n4.3\n4,380\n4,089\n7.1\n6.4\nTotal\n$\n6,057\n$\n5,494\n10.3\n%\n9.6\n%\n$\n17,945\n$\n16,159\n11.1\n%\n10.9\n%\nSegment:\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology\n$\n3,803\n$\n3,324\n14.4\n%\n13.9\n%\n$\n11,085\n$\n9,636\n15.0\n%\n14.9\n%\nOrthopaedics\n2,254\n2,170\n3.9\n3.1\n6,860\n6,523\n5.2\n4.9\nTotal\n$\n6,057\n$\n5,494\n10.3\n%\n9.6\n%\n$\n17,945\n$\n16,159\n11.1\n%\n10.9\n%\nSupplemental Net Sales Growth Information\nThree Months\nNine Months\nPercentage Change\nPercentage Change\nUnited \nStates\nInternational\nUnited \nStates\nInternational\n2025\n2024\nAs \nReported\nConstant \nCurrency\nAs \nReported\nAs \nReported\nConstant \nCurrency\n2025\n2024\nAs \nReported\nConstant \nCurrency\nAs \nReported\nAs \nReported\nConstant \nCurrency\nMedSurg and \nNeurotechnology:\nInstruments\n$\n760\n$\n679\n11.9\n%\n11.4\n%\n11.5\n%\n13.9\n%\n11.2\n%\n$\n2,258\n$\n2,044\n10.5\n%\n10.3\n%\n10.6\n%\n9.8\n%\n8.9\n%\nEndoscopy\n896\n837\n7.0\n6.7\n7.9\n2.6\n0.8\n2,662\n2,383\n11.7\n11.7\n12.7\n7.2\n7.1\nMedical\n985\n938\n5.1\n4.7\n5.6\n2.8\n0.3\n2,920\n2,710\n7.8\n7.7\n9.2\n0.7\n0.3\nVascular\n525\n329\n59.6\n58.9\n136.9\n14.3\n12.4\n1,429\n966\n48.0\n47.9\n104.4\n13.2\n12.6\nNeuro Cranial\n637\n541\n17.6\n17.0\n17.3\n19.0\n15.5\n1,816\n1,533\n18.4\n18.2\n19.2\n15.0\n13.7\n$\n3,803\n$\n3,324\n14.4\n%\n13.9\n%\n15.7\n%\n10.1\n%\n7.7\n%\n$\n11,085\n$\n9,636\n15.0\n%\n14.9\n%\n16.8\n%\n9.0\n%\n8.4\n%\nOrthopaedics:\nKnees\n$\n628\n$\n570\n10.2\n%\n9.6\n%\n8.4\n%\n14.9\n%\n12.7\n%\n$\n1,907\n$\n1,760\n8.4\n%\n8.3\n%\n7.6\n%\n10.3\n%\n10.0\n%\nHips\n457\n420\n8.9\n7.9\n8.7\n9.2\n6.8\n1,366\n1,241\n10.1\n9.7\n8.1\n13.2\n12.3\nTrauma and \nExtremities\n960\n849\n13.0\n11.9\n13.2\n12.5\n8.5\n2,862\n2,511\n14.0\n13.5\n15.0\n11.1\n9.4\nOther\n203\n159\n28.1\n27.5\n38.5\n3.6\n1.3\n548\n490\n11.9\n11.8\n13.5\n8.1\n7.8\n$\n2,248\n$\n1,998\n12.5\n%\n11.7\n%\n12.9\n%\n11.5\n%\n8.6\n%\n$\n6,683\n$\n6,002\n11.3\n%\n11.1\n%\n11.4\n%\n11.2\n%\n10.2\n%\nSpinal Implants\n6\n172\n(96.7)\n(96.9)\n(100.0)\n(89.3)\n(89.7)\n177\n521\n(66.1)\n(65.9)\n(67.4)\n(63.1)\n(62.4)\n$\n2,254\n$\n2,170\n3.9\n%\n3.1\n%\n4.1\n%\n3.2\n%\n0.5\n%\n$\n6,860\n$\n6,523\n5.2\n%\n4.9\n%\n5.2\n%\n5.0\n%\n4.2\n%\nTotal \n$\n6,057\n$\n5,494\n10.3\n%\n9.6\n%\n11.4\n%\n6.9\n%\n4.3\n%\n$\n17,945\n$\n16,159\n11.1\n%\n10.9\n%\n12.4\n%\n7.1\n%\n6.4\n%\nNote: In the first quarter \n2025\n we changed the name of our Neurovascular business to Vascular due the acquisition of Inari.

The increase in net expense in the \nthree months\n and \nnine\n \nmonths\n \n2025\n from \n2024\n was primarily due to higher interest\n \nexpense in \n2025\n.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rates were \n16.5%\n and \n14.7%\n in the \nthree\n and\n \nnine months\n \n2025\n and \n20.0%\n and \n17.4%\n in the \nthree\n and \nnine\n \nmonths\n \n2024\n. The effective income tax rate for the \nthree\n months\n \n2025 decreased from three months 2024 due to certain discrete\n \ntax items.  The effective tax rate for the \nnine months\n \n2025\n \ndecreased from \nnine months\n \n2024\n due to the \n2025\n tax benefit\n \nrelated to the sale of the Spinal Implants business and certain\n \ndiscrete tax items. The effective tax rates for the \nthree\n and \nnine\n \nmonths\n \n2025\n and \n2024\n reflect the continued lower effective\n \nincome tax rates as a result of our European operations.\n  \nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n \n(OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries, has\n \nput forth two proposed base erosion and profit shifting\n \nframeworks that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus\n \nrules (Pillar One) and ensure a minimal level of taxation (Pillar\n \nTwo). On December 12, 2022 the European Union member\n \nstates agreed to implement the Inclusive Framework’s global\n \ncorporate minimum tax rate of 15%, and various countries within\n \nand outside the European Union have either enacted or proposed\n \nnew tax laws implementing Pillar Two in 2024. The OECD\n \ncontinues to release additional guidance and we anticipate more\n \ncountries will enact similar tax laws. Some of the new tax laws\n \nbecame effective in 2024 while others will be effective in 2025\n \nand future years. These tax law changes and any additional\n \ncontemplated tax law changes could increase tax expense in\n \nfuture periods\n.\nOn July 4, 2025 the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was\n \nenacted into United States law. We evaluated the impact of the\n \nOBBBA and recorded the tax-related provisions in the three\n \nmonths 2025. The impact was not material to the Consolidated\n \nFinancial Statements.\nNet Earnings\nNet earnings increased to \n$859\n or \n$2.22\n per diluted share in the\n \nthree months\n  \n2025\n from \n$834\n or \n$2.16\n per diluted share in \n2024\n.\n \nNet earnings decreased to \n$2,397\n or \n$6.20\n per diluted share in\n \nnine months\n \n2025\n from \n$2,447\n or \n$6.35\n per diluted share in\n \n2024\n.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information\n \ndetermined under accounting principles generally accepted in the\n \nUnited States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures,\n \nincluding percentage sales growth in constant currency;\n \npercentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted\n \nselling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research,\n \ndevelopment and engineering expenses; adjusted operating\n \nincome; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted income\n \ntaxes; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings;\n \nand adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS). We\n \nbelieve these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful\n \ninformation to assist investors and shareholders in understanding\n \nour financial results and assessing our prospects for future\n \nperformance. Management believes percentage sales growth in\n \nconstant currency and the other adjusted measures described\n \nabove are important indicators of our operations because they\n \nexclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our\n \ncore operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends\n \nin our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-\nGAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of\n \nreportable business segments and analyzing potential future\n \nbusiness trends in connection with our budget process and bases\n \ncertain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP\n \nfinancial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in\n \nconstant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign\n \ncurrency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend\n \nof sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is\n \ncalculated by translating current and prior year results at the\n \nsame foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage\n \norganic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in\n \nforeign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures,\n \nwhich affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage\n \norganic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and\n \nprior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rates\n \nexcluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure\n \nearnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we\n \nexclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating\n \nresults and the trend of earnings. The income tax effect of each\n \nadjustment was determined based on the tax effect of the\n \njurisdiction in which the related pre-tax adjustment was recorded.\n \nThese adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be\n \nindicative of our past and future performance. The following are\n \nexamples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a\n \nperiod:\n1.\nAcquisition and integration-related costs\n. Costs related to\n \nintegrating recently acquired businesses (e.g., costs\n \nassociated with the termination of sales relationships,\n \nemployee retention and workforce reductions, manufacturing\n \nintegration costs and other integration-related activities),\n \nchanges in the fair value of contingent consideration,\n \namortization of inventory stepped-up to fair value, specific\n \ncosts (e.g., deal costs and costs associated with legal entity\n \nrationalization) related to the consummation of the\n \nacquisition process and legal entity rationalization and\n \nacquisition-related tax items.\nDollar amounts are in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\n16\nSTRYKER CORPORATION\n2025\n \nThird Quarter\n Form 10-Q\n2.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n. Periodic\n \namortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.\n3.\nStructural optimization and other special charges.\n Costs\n \nassociated with employee retention and workforce\n \nreductions, the closure or transfer of manufacturing and\n \nother facilities (e.g., site closure costs, contract termination\n \ncosts and redundant employee costs during the work\n \ntransfers), product line exits (primarily inventory, long-lived\n \nasset and specifically-identified intangible asset write-offs),\n \ncertain long-lived and intangible asset write-offs and\n \nimpairments and other charges.\n4.\nMedical device regulations.\n Costs specific to updating our\n \nquality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product\n \nremanufacturing to comply with the new medical device\n \nreporting regulations and other requirements of the\n \nEuropean Union.\n5.\nRecall-related matters\n. Changes in our best estimate of the\n \nprobable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable\n \nlosses when a best estimate within a range is not known, to\n \nresolve the Rejuvenate, LFIT V40, Wright legacy hip\n \nproducts and other product recalls.\n6.\nRegulatory and legal matters\n. Changes in our best estimate\n \nof the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of\n \nprobable losses when a best estimate within a range is not\n \nknown, to resolve certain regulatory or other legal matters\n \nand the amount of favorable awards from settlements.\n7.\nTax matters\n. Impact of accounting for certain significant and\n \ndiscrete tax items.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it\n \nmay not be possible to compare these financial measures with\n \nother companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same\n \nor similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not\n \nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales\n \ngrowth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses,\n \nresearch, development and engineering expenses, operating\n \nincome, other income (expense), net, income taxes, effective\n \nincome tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share,\n \nthe most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These\n \nnon-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing\n \naspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results\n \nand the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial\n \nmeasures at the end of the discussion of Consolidated Results of\n \nOperations below. We strongly encourage investors and\n \nshareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed\n \nreports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial\n \nmeasure.\nThe weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the\n \ncalculation of adjusted net earnings per diluted share are the\n \nsame as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings\n \nper diluted share for the respective period.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measures\nThree Months 2025\nGross \nProfit\nSelling, \nGeneral &
