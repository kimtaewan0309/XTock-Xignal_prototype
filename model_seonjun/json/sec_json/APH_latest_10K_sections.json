Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:\n​\n●\nPursue broad market diversification\n - The Company constantly strives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products.  Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to participate wherever significant growth opportunities are available.  This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any one particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance.  An overview of the Company’s market and product participation is described under “Markets”.\n​\n●\nDevelop high-technology performance-enhancing solutions\n - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships with customers across its diverse end markets.  The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions.  These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect, antenna and sensor products, and have been developed across the Company’s end markets.  The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as antennas and sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.\n​\n●\nExpand global presence\n - The Company is strategically expanding and shifting its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships.  As the Company’s global customers have grown their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs, the Company is continuing to expand and shift its international footprint in order to provide real-time capabilities to these customers.  The majority of the Company’s international operations have broad capabilities, including new product development.  The Company is also able to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs in some regions, and has established low-cost manufacturing and assembly facilities around the world.\n​\n●\nControl costs\n - The Company recognizes the importance in today’s global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure.  Innovation, product quality and performance, and comprehensive customer service are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs.  Controlling costs is part of a mindset.  It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, working with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a reasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset where managers manage the Company’s assets as if they were their own.\n​\n●\nPursue strategic acquisitions and investments\n - The Company believes that the industry in which it operates is highly fragmented and continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions.  As a result, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high-potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence.  We seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenol’s position with customers across our diverse end markets, our leading technologies and our access to low-cost manufacturing around the world.  In 2024, the Company invested approximately $2.2 billion to fund two acquisitions, while in 2023, the Company invested approximately $970 million to fund 10 acquisitions.  Our acquisitions in 2024 and 2023 have strengthened our customer base and product offerings in many of our end markets and have brought new high-performing management teams into the Company.  In particular, the acquisition in May 2024 of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (“CIT”), a leading global supplier of harsh environment interconnect solutions, primarily to the commercial aerospace, defense and industrial end markets, with a wide range of products, including wire and cable, cable assemblies, contacts, connectors and sensors, represents one of the largest acquisitions in the Company’s history.  Management believes that CIT’s wide range of products are highly complementary to Amphenol’s existing interconnect and sensor solutions.\n​\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nFoster collaborative, entrepreneurial management\n - Amphenol’s management system is designed to provide clear income statement and balance sheet responsibility in a flat organizational structure.

The increase in the Company’s backlog was primarily related to strong demand for the Company’s products that support AI applications, as well as contributions from the Company’s acquisition program.  Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions.  Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.  It is expected that nearly all of the Company’s backlog will be filled within the next 12 months.  A significant portion of the Company’s business, such as sales to the communications-related markets and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.  Generally, the Company does not experience significant seasonality in its business, although historically, the strongest quarters have typically been the last two quarters of our fiscal year\n.\n​\nEnvironmental Matt\ners\n​\nCertain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.

The issuances of such licenses, in particular within the defense market, are subject to complex laws and regulations that could change frequently and with limited notice, depending on the jurisdiction, geopolitical events or other factors.  The Company has systems in place to apply for licenses and to maintain compliance with any such regulations.  Separately, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and non-U.S. economic sanctions and trade embargoes, as well as the terms of any preferential duty and/or tariff programs in which we participate.\n​\nFor a discussion of certain risks related to government regulation, including export and import controls and sanctions, refer to the risk factors titled “\nThe Company is exposed to political, economic, military and other risks related to operating in countries outside the United States, and changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. and other countries’ trade policies and other factors beyond the Company’s control may adversely impact its business and operating results\n,” “\nThe Company must comply with complex export and import controls as well as economic sanctions and trade embargoes imposed by the United States government and other countries\n,” “\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks\n,” and “\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners\n,” in Part I, Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n herein.\n​\nHuman Capital Management and Our Culture\n​\nThe Company’s success is closely tied to the capability, adaptability and accountability of our diverse, global organization.  One of the key components of our business strategy is the fostering of a collaborative and entrepreneurial management culture. Each of our general managers operates in a flat organizational structure and is enabled and incented to grow and develop their business, with the support of the resources of the larger organization.  We believe this structure, with approximately 140 general managers running unique, independent businesses, creates an environment and \n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nculture where each of our general managers has a more direct link to the success of their individual businesses and a more personal connection to the employees they oversee and the communities in which they operate.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 125,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 12,000 were located in the United States.  Less than 10% of Amphenol’s U.S. workforce is represented by an independent trade union or covered by collective bargaining.  The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees. \n​\nOur Board of Directors (the “Board”) is actively involved in overseeing the Company’s employee-related strategies and practices as well as the Company’s culture. This oversight is conducted both directly and through certain of the Board’s committees.  At each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, the Board reviews changes in key personnel and, at least once a year, meets with management to discuss various human resources related topics.  We believe the Company’s culture has been a critical component of the Company’s success and reinforcing that culture is a key responsibility of our executive management.\n​\nOur business spans the globe, and the employees in our facilities reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate.  At Amphenol, we promote and maintain a culture of respect and appreciation of differences in our employees.  The Company generally relies on local management in every business unit to foster a strong culture consistent with the Company’s values and to be cognizant of local circumstances and requirements, which we believe creates a high degree of organizational stability and a deep commitment to our people and the local community.  A key hallmark of our structure is our entrepreneurial culture that creates clear accountability for each of our general managers, who are our key business leaders.  Our core management team is comprised of these general managers and their controllers, as well as our group general managers and executive management team.  Women represented 22% of this core management team at the end of 2024.  Of our total employees worldwide, approximately half are women.\n​\nThe safety and well-being of our employees is critical to the successful operation of our business.  Our health and safety activities are overseen by our corporate environmental, health, safety and sustainability leadership team and are managed by our local teams, who coordinate on-site safety programs, resources, reporting and training in our facilities. We believe that this model of coaching and tracking at the corporate level, but administering at the facility level, has allowed us to provide training and supervision that better fits the local needs of each of our workforces.\n​\nThe Company is focused on providing fair and competitive compensation and benefits to our employees around the world.  In the U.S., in addition to competitive compensation, the Company maintains various employee benefits such as health and related insurance, retirement savings programs and health savings and flexible spending accounts.  Outside the U.S., we maintain compensation and other benefits competitive with local market conditions.\n​\nAmphenol strives to be a positive influence in the communities in which we operate around the world.  Most of our community outreach is organized by our local management teams, which helps ensure that our efforts are working in support of the local communities in which our employees live and work.\n​\nSustainability Report\n​\nWe have a shared commitment to create innovative products that enable our customers to improve the lives of people around the world, to support the well-being of our employees and communities and to sustain the health of our planet.  We believe that long-term value for our Company is created through making sustainable business choices, building strong relationships with our stakeholders and engaging in good corporate governance.  Whether through reducing our and our partners’ environmental footprint, following humane labor practices, supporting the development of our global team, ensuring the strength and integrity of our supply chain or giving back to our communities, we have always believed that it is not just good stewardship, but good business to focus on the long-term sustainability of Amphenol\n.\n​\nThe Company publishes an annual sustainability report (“Sustainability Report”) to highlight our goals and areas of \nprogress and success in sustainability matters, including climate-related topics.  The Sustainability Report discusses our approach and progress on the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues most significant to our business, \nincluding ESG-related strategies, programs, goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to our stakeholders.  The Sustainability Report is designed to inform and engage the Company’s broad range of stakeholders, such as investors, customers, suppliers, employees and members of the communities in which we operate, among others.  Our 2023 Sustainability Report was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards \n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nframework and topics identified under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards and outlines board and executive-level oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities identified in the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations.  The SASB standards and GRI and TCFD frameworks encourage companies to disclose climate-related topics that are important to certain interested stakeholders, even if not material for purposes of \nthe U.S. securities laws.  Furthermore, the materiality standards under these frameworks and other regimes we may consider are different from, and often more expansive than, the materiality standard under the U.S. securities laws.  Our 2023 Sustainability Report\n is available on our website at https://amphenol.com/sustainability\n.  The items discussed in our 2023 Sustainability Report have not required material capital expenditures or operating expenses, nor caused material operational challenges or risks to the Company’s business or results of operations beyond those items disclosed in Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n within the risk factors titled “\nThe Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused or intensified by climate change and global warming\n,” and “\nThe Company is subject to, and may continue to be subject to, incremental costs, risks and regulations associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change.\n”\n \n Information included in our 2023 Sustainability Report and our website is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report.
