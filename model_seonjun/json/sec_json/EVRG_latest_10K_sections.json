(Evergy Missouri West) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri.\n•\nEvergy Transmission Company, LLC (Evergy Transmission Company) owns 13.5% of Transource Energy, LLC (Transource) with the remaining 86.5% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP).  Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects.  Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central also owns a 50% interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind), which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  Prairie Wind owns a 108-mile, 345 kilovolt (kV) double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP).  Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro, and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy.  The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment).  Evergy serves approximately 1.7 million customers located in Kansas and Missouri.  Customers include approximately 1.5 million residences, 0.2 million commercial firms and 7,500 industrials, municipalities and other electric utilities.  Evergy is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one-third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter.\nEvergy expects to continue operating its integrated utilities within the currently existing regulatory frameworks and is focused on enabling economic development across all of its service territories to strengthen the communities it serves and meet customer electric demand growth through the continued evolution of its generation, transmission and distribution systems.  Evergy will remain focused on consistently delivering on its affordability, reliability and \n8\nTable of Contents\n \nsustainability objectives and delivering competitive long-term returns to shareholders, including growth in earnings per share and targeting a 60%-70% dividend payout ratio.  The core tenets of Evergy's strategy are as follows: \n•\nAffordability – maintaining affordable rates while investing in infrastructure and technology to meet customer demand;\n•\nReliability – targeting top-tier performance in reliability, customer service and generation; and\n•\nSustainability – advancing a responsible fleet transition while ensuring affordability and reliability.\nSee Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Operations (MD&A) – Executive Summary – Strategy, for additional information.\nThe table below summarizes the percentage of Evergy's revenues by customer class.\n2024\n2023\n2022\nResidential\n37%\n37%\n37%\nCommercial\n34%\n33%\n32%\nIndustrial\n12%\n12%\n12%\nWholesale\n5%\n7%\n9%\nTransmission\n8%\n7%\n6%\nOther\n4%\n4%\n4%\nTotal\n100%\n100%\n100%\nThe table below summarizes the percentage of Evergy's retail electricity sales by customer class.\n2024\n2023\n2022\nResidential\n37%\n37%\n38%\nCommercial\n43%\n43%\n42%\nIndustrial\n20%\n20%\n20%\nTotal\n100%\n100%\n100%\nRegulation\nEvergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas operations are regulated by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) and Evergy Metro's Missouri operations and Evergy Missouri West are regulated by the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri (MPSC), in each case with respect to retail rates, certain accounting matters, standards of service and, in certain cases, the issuance of securities, certification of facilities and service territories.  The Evergy Companies are also subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to transmission, wholesale sales and rates, the issuance of securities in certain cases and other matters.  Evergy has an indirect 94% ownership interest in Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek), which is subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with respect to licensing, operations and safety-related requirements.  \nThe table below summarizes the rate orders in effect for Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's retail rate jurisdictions.\nRegulator\nAllowed Return on Equity\nEffective Date\nEvergy Kansas Central \n(a)\nKCC\n9.4% (b)\nDecember 2023\nEvergy Metro - Kansas\nKCC\n9.4% (b)\nDecember 2023\nEvergy Metro - Missouri\nMPSC\n(c)\nJanuary 2023\nEvergy Missouri West\nMPSC\n(c)\nJanuary 2025\n(a) \nThe KCC establishes rates for Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South on a consolidated basis.\n9\nTable of Contents\n \n(b) \nCurrent KCC rate orders do not contain an explicit allowed return on equity.  The return on equity presented in this table reflects the current order in Kansas which stated an allowed return on equity to be utilized for purposes of the transmission delivery charge (TDC).  \n(c) \nCurrent MPSC rate orders do not contain an explicit allowed return on equity.  \nEvergy expects its 2025 Kansas and Missouri jurisdictional retail revenues to be approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, based on historical averages of Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's total retail revenues.\nSee Item 7, MD&A, Critical Accounting Policies section, and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters.\nCompetition \nMissouri and Kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model.  As a result, the Evergy Companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies.  If Missouri or Kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice, Evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations, which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a write-off of certain regulatory assets and liabilities.      \nEvergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory.  This competition primarily occurs within the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) Integrated Marketplace, in which Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are participants.  This marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum regional cost-effectiveness.  \nThe SPP Integrated Marketplace is similar to other regional transmission organization (RTO) or Independent System Operator (ISO) markets currently operating in other regions of the United States.\nPower Supply\nEvergy has approximately 15,800 megawatts (MWs) of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements.  Evergy's owned generation and power purchases from others, as a percentage of total megawatt hours (MWhs) generated and purchased, was approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, over the last three years.  About 60% of Evergy's purchased power was purchased under long-term renewable purchased power contracts over the last three years.  Evergy purchases power to meet its customers' needs, to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards.  Management believes Evergy will be able to meet its future power purchase needs due to the coordination of planning and operations in the SPP region and existing power purchase agreements; however, price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand or reduced supply.  \nEvergy's total capacity by fuel type, including both owned generating capacity and power purchase agreements, is detailed in the table below.\nFuel Type\nEstimated 2025 MW Capacity\nPercent of Total Capacity\nCoal\n5,927 \n37 \n%\nWind \n(a)\n4,525 \n29 \nNatural gas and oil\n4,210 \n27 \nUranium\n1,106 \n7 \nSolar and landfill gas\n22 \n— \nTotal capacity\n15,790 \n100 \n%\n(a) \nMWs are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility.  Includes owned generating capacity of 778 MWs and long-term power purchase agreements of approximately 3,747 MWs of wind generation that expire from 2028 through 2048.  See Item 2, Properties, for additional information.\n10\nTable of Contents\n \nEvergy's projected peak summer demand for 2025 is approximately 10,600 MWs.  Evergy expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for 2025 with its existing generation assets and power purchases.  See \"Transitioning Evergy's Generation Fleet\" below for further information regarding Evergy's long-term strategy with regard to its generating assets and power purchases.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are members of the SPP.  The SPP is a FERC-approved RTO with the responsibility to ensure reliable power supply, adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale electricity prices in the region.  As SPP members, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 15% for 2025.  Beginning in 2026, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West will be required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 16%.  This net positive supply of capacity is maintained through generation asset ownership, capacity agreements, power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs.  The reserve margin is designed to support reliability of the region's electric supply.  \nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and hazardous substance disposal, protected natural resources (such as wetlands, federally-listed species and other protected wildlife) and health and safety.  For example, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West combust large amounts of fossil fuels in the production of electricity, which results in significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) and other greenhouse gases (GHG).  Federal legislation regulates the emission of GHGs and numerous states and regions have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA), water under the Clean Water Act and waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, among other laws and regulations. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  There have been, and management believes there will continue to be, policy, legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change, such as efforts to reduce GHG emissions, impose a tax on those emissions and create incentives for low-carbon generation and energy efficiency.  These efforts, and climate change itself, have the potential to adversely affect the Evergy Companies' operations, financial position and cash flows.  See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.\nThe Evergy Companies are unable to predict changes in regulations, regulatory guidance, legal interpretations, policy positions and implementation actions that may result from the change in presidential administrations.  The Evergy Companies have taken, and will continue to take, proactive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on its businesses.  For example, the Evergy Companies regularly conduct preparedness exercises for a variety of disruptive events, including storms, which may become more frequent or intense due to climate change.  In addition, the Evergy Companies have invested, and will continue to invest, in grid resiliency.  Much of the Evergy Companies' infrastructure is advanced in age, and grid resiliency efforts include building additional transmission and distribution lines, performing necessary system maintenance, replacing necessary infrastructure and proactively managing the vegetation that can damage systems during severe weather.  The Evergy Companies also monitor water conditions at their generating facilities and focus on water conservation at these facilities to address resource depletion.\nTransitioning Evergy's Generation Fleet\nEvergy is committed to a long-term strategy focused on affordability, reliability and sustainability, including the responsible transition of the generation fleet.  Given the age, cost and emissions profile of Evergy's current fossil plants, Evergy expects to retire coal-fired generating units over time or convert these units to alternative fuel sources such as natural gas.  This generation portfolio transition is expected to have a corresponding impact on CO\n2\n emissions, continuing a long-term trend.  In 2024, Evergy's total CO\n2 \nemissions from owned generation units were more than 50% lower than 2005 levels.  Through the responsible transition of its generation fleet, Evergy has a long-term goal to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\n2\ne) emissions, for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, by 2045.  The trajectory and timing of achieving emissions reductions relative to 2005 levels and Evergy's long-term emissions reduction goal are expected to be dependent on the evolution of Evergy's integrated resource plans (IRP) and many external factors, including enabling technology developments, trends in total demand for electricity, \n11\nTable of Contents\n \nthe reliability of the power grid, availability of transmission capacity, supportive energy policies and regulations, among other external factors.  See \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\" and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional information.\nDiversity of fuel supply has historically provided cost and reliability benefits.  For example, because renewable generation can be intermittent, diversity of baseload generation fuel, including a mix of uranium, coal and natural gas, has helped to maintain a consistent availability of power.  In addition, the Evergy Companies must prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the Evergy Companies to include in rates.  The Evergy Companies use a triennial IRP, a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and demand for electricity, to inform the manner in which they supply electricity.  The IRP considers forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, cost of environmental compliance, integration of renewables, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response initiatives.  The transition of Evergy's generation fleet over time is expected to result in ongoing reductions in emissions.  Strategies that the Evergy Companies are pursuing to advance a responsible portfolio transition include:\n•\nretiring older coal-fired generation or converting coal-fired generation resources to natural gas;\n•\ndeveloping renewable energy and natural gas facilities;\n•\ngrid investment and advancement;\n•\ncollaborating with regulators to offer customers the opportunity to procure electricity produced with renewable resources; and \n•\ninvesting in customer energy efficiency programs.\nSince 2005, the Evergy Companies have added over 4,600 MWs of renewable generation, while retiring more than 2,400 MWs of fossil generation.  See Item 2, Properties, for additional information regarding the Evergy Companies' renewable generation resources.  The Evergy Companies are also committed to transparency.  On its website, http://investors.evergy.com, Evergy provides quantitative and qualitative data regarding various environmental, social and governance matters, including information related to emissions, waste and water.  The contents of the website, including reports and documents contained therein, are not incorporated into this filing.\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.\nFuel\nThe fuel sources for Evergy's owned generation and power purchase agreements are coal, wind and other renewable sources, uranium and natural gas and oil.  The actual 2024 fuel mix and fuel cost in cents per net kilowatt hour (kWh) delivered are outlined in the following table.\nFuel cost in cents per\nFuel Mix\n(a)\nnet kWh delivered\nActual\nActual\nFuel\n2024\n2024\nCoal\n38\n%\n2.39¢\nWind, landfill gas and solar\n (b)\n32\n1.82\nUranium\n19\n0.66\nNatural gas and oil\n11\n3.25\n   Total\n100\n%\n1.97\n(a)\n Fuel mix based on percent of net MWhs generated by owned resources and delivered under renewable power purchase agreements.\n(b)\n Fuel cost in cents per net kWh delivered includes costs associated with renewable power purchase agreements.\nCoal\nDuring 2025, Evergy's generating units, including jointly-owned units, are projected to use approximately 15 million tons of coal.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have entered into coal-purchase contracts with various suppliers in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB), the nation's \n12\nTable of Contents\n \nprincipal supply region of low-sulfur coal, and with local suppliers.  The coal to be provided under these contracts is expected to satisfy approximately 65%, 45% and 35% of the projected coal requirements for 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively.  The remainder of the coal requirements is expected to be fulfilled through entering into additional contracts or spot market purchases. \nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the PRB and local suppliers to their generating units.  The transportation services to be provided under these contracts are expected to satisfy all of the projected transportation requirements for 2025 and 60% and 20% of the projected transportation requirements for 2026 and 2027, respectively.  The contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs.  \nNuclear Fuel\nEvergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro each owns 47% of Wolf Creek, which is Evergy's only nuclear generating unit.  Wolf Creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor.  This process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies.  The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract all the uranium, uranium enrichment and conversion services needed to operate Wolf Creek through the first quarter of 2030.  The owners also have under contract all the nuclear fuel assembly fabrication services required to operate Wolf Creek through 2045.\nNatural Gas\nEvergy purchases natural gas for use in its generating units primarily through spot market purchases.  From time to time, Evergy also may enter into contracts, including the use of derivatives, in an effort to manage the cost of natural gas.  For additional information about Evergy's exposure to commodity price risks, see Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West maintain natural gas transportation arrangements with Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc.  The Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. arrangement expires based on the generating unit being served with expiration dates from 2025 to 2030.  \nCustomer Energy Efficiency Programs\nThe Evergy Companies have implemented, and continue to offer, energy efficiency programs to help customers with their energy efficiency needs and to help manage energy costs.  Both Missouri and Kansas have passed legislation promoting the implementation of cost-effective demand-side management programs and allowing for the recovery of these program costs from customers, along with the potential to earn performance incentives based upon certain criteria.\nIn Missouri, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West currently offer a suite of energy efficiency programs for customers under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA).  In 2024, the MPSC approved a portfolio of programs for the years 2025 through 2027.  The MEEIA programs provide for the recovery of program costs, throughput disincentive and the opportunity to earn an incentive based upon certain program costs or demand savings achieved.  The costs of the programs are recovered from customers through a rider mechanism.  \nIn Kansas, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro currently offer a suite of energy efficiency programs for customers under the Kansas Energy Efficiency Investment Act (KEEIA).  The current portfolio of programs was approved by the KCC for March 2024 through February 2028.  The KEEIA programs provide for the recovery of program costs, throughput disincentive and the opportunity to earn a performance incentive based primarily upon demand and energy savings achieved.  The costs of the programs will be recovered through a rider mechanism. \nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Evergy Companies had 4,731 employees, including 2,494 represented by five local unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and one local union of the United Government Security Officers of America (UGSOA).  The Evergy Companies currently have labor agreements with four unions that expire at varying times in 2025 through 2027 and one labor agreement that is operating under an \n13\nTable of Contents\n \nextension while a long-term agreement is being negotiated.  The Evergy Companies employ 1,897 generation employees, 1,469 transmission and distribution employees and 1,365 support employees that work primarily in the states of Kansas and Missouri.\nEvergy's mission is to empower a better future and a key component of this mission is maintaining a culture that emphasizes safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability.\nSafety is a crucial part of Evergy's values.  The components of Evergy's safety program include a strong management commitment to a safety-conscious work environment, hazard recognition and control, worksite analysis, contractor safety management and training.  Evergy also conducts regular safety audits and assessments.  \nEvergy offers a competitive package of compensation and benefits to attract and retain talented employees, including market-competitive pay, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off, family leave and tuition reimbursement.

Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately 15,800 MWs of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 1.7 million customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri.  The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment).\nStrategy\nEvergy expects to continue operating its integrated utilities within the currently existing regulatory frameworks and is focused on enabling economic development across all of its service territories to strengthen the communities it serves and meet customer electric demand growth through the continued evolution of its generation, transmission and distribution systems.  Evergy will remain focused on consistently delivering on its affordability, reliability and sustainability objectives and delivering competitive long-term returns to shareholders, including growth in earnings per share and targeting a 60% - 70% dividend payout ratio.  The core tenets of Evergy's strategy are as follows:\n•\nAffordability – maintaining affordable rates while investing in infrastructure and technology to meet customer demand;\n•\nReliability – targeting top-tier performance in reliability, customer service and generation; and\n•\nSustainability – advancing a responsible fleet transition while ensuring affordability and reliability.\nSignificant elements of Evergy's plan to achieve its strategic objectives include:\n•\nmaintaining rigorous cost management across the business while ensuring reliability and sustainability;\n•\nfostering economic development in Kansas and Missouri by serving new business customers and enabling the expansion of existing customers' operations;\n•\ntargeting approximately $17.5 billion of expected base capital investments through 2029 including new generation of approximately $6.2 billion which is expected to be primarily renewable and natural gas generation that will help enable historic economic development opportunities in Kansas and Missouri.  See \n37\nTable of Contents\n \n\"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures,\" for further information regarding Evergy's projected capital expenditures through 2029;\n•\npursuing the responsible transition of Evergy's generation fleet, including the development of renewable energy and natural gas facilities and the retirement or conversion to natural gas of older coal-fired plants consistent with Evergy's IRPs.  The trajectory and timing of achieving emissions reductions relative to 2005 levels and Evergy's long-term emissions reductions goal are expected to be dependent on enabling technology developments, trends in total total demand for electricity, the reliability of the power grid, availability of transmission capacity and supportive energy policies and regulations, among other external factors.  See \"Transitioning Evergy's Generation Fleet\" in Part I, Item 1. Business, for additional information; and\n•\naccessing debt and equity capital markets to support the Evergy Companies' capital investment plans.\nSee \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\" and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional information. \nEvergy Kansas Central's 2025 Rate Case Proceeding\nIn January 2025, Evergy Kansas Central filed an application with the KCC to request an increase to its retail revenues of approximately $196 million.  Evergy Kansas Central's request reflected a return on equity of 10.5% (with a capital structure composed of 52% equity) and increases related to the recovery of infrastructure investments made to improve reliability and enhance customer service and the update of expenses to current levels of spend.  New rates are expected to be effective in September 2025.  \nEvergy Missouri West 2024 Rate Case Proceeding\nIn February 2024, Evergy Missouri West filed an application with the MPSC to request an increase to its retail revenues of approximately $104 million.  Evergy Missouri West's request reflected a return on equity of 10.5% (with a capital structure composed of 52% equity) and increases related to the recovery of infrastructure investments made to improve reliability and enhance customer service and the inclusion of certain costs related to Dogwood Energy Center (Dogwood) and Crossroads Energy Center (Crossroads), two natural gas plants.\nIn October 2024, Evergy Missouri West, the MPSC staff and other intervenors in the case reached a unanimous partial stipulation and agreement to settle certain issues in the case.  The partial stipulation and agreement provided for an increase to Evergy Missouri West's retail revenues of approximately $55 million after lowering base rates for fuel and purchased power expense of approximately $49 million and rebasing property tax expense.   \nIn December 2024, the MPSC issued a final rate order approving the unanimous partial stipulation and agreement.  The new rates established by this order took effect in January 2025.\nKansas Legislation\nIn April 2024, Kansas H.B. 2527 was signed into law by the Governor of Kansas.  Most notably, H.B. 2527 includes a PISA provision that can be elected by Kansas electric public utilities to defer and recover as regulatory assets 90% of depreciation expense and associated return on investment linked to qualifying electric plants in service.  Qualifying electric plant includes all rate base additions by an electric public utility, but does not include transmission facilities or new electric generating units.  The deferred depreciation and return on the associated regulatory asset are required to be included in determining the utility's rate base during subsequent general rate proceedings.  The return on the deferred regulatory asset balances will be calculated using the weighted average cost of capital.  Utilities that elect the PISA provision can make qualifying deferrals of depreciation and return from July 2024 through December 2030.  Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro elected the PISA provision in their Kansas jurisdictions effective in July 2024. \nAdditionally, the law establishes new mechanisms for the recovery of costs associated with new gas-fired generating units.  If the KCC decides investment in a new gas-fired generating unit is reasonable, the utility would be able to recover the return on 100% of the associated construction costs at its weighted average cost of capital.  \n38\nTable of Contents\n \nThe cost recovery from customers could begin a year after construction begins.  Rates could be adjusted every six months until new base rates reflecting the plant's costs are established.\nIn April 2024, Kansas S.B. 410 was signed into law by the Governor of Kansas. Most notably, S.B. 410 includes an exemption from all property and ad valorem taxes on certain electric generation facilities for which construction or installation begins on or after January 1, 2025.\nNatural Gas Plant Investments\nThe Evergy Companies use a triennial IRP, a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and demand for electricity, to inform the manner in which they supply electricity. The most recent IRPs incorporate the latest SPP resource adequacy requirements and anticipated load growth.  Based on these and other factors, the IRP indicated the addition of new supply side resources, including combined and simple cycle natural gas plants, would be needed.\nIn April 2024, Evergy Missouri West purchased a 22% ownership interest representing approximately 145 MW in Dogwood, an operational combined-cycle natural gas facility located in Missouri, for approximately $60 million.  The purchase was recorded as an asset acquisition to property, plant and equipment, net, on Evergy's consolidated balance sheet.  The purchase was subject to terms and conditions listed in a stipulation and agreement approved by the MPSC allowing Evergy Missouri West to recover in rates a return of and return on the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood.  Evergy Missouri West shall also be allowed to recover in rates over two years a return of, but not a return on, the amount of the purchase price paid in excess of the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood.  In addition, net revenues generated from Evergy Missouri West's ownership of Dogwood from the date of closing to the date new rates become effective in Evergy Missouri West's current rate case shall not impact rates and shall be retained by Evergy Missouri West and reduce the amount of the purchase price paid in excess of the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood to be recovered from customers.\nIn October 2024, Evergy announced its plan to construct two combined-cycle natural gas plants located in Kansas.  Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Missouri West will jointly-own each plant and expect each plant to have an initial generating capacity of approximately 705 MW.  The first plant is expected to begin operations by summer of 2029 and the second plant is expected to begin operations by summer of 2030.\nAdditionally, Evergy Missouri West plans to construct a 440 MW simple-cycle natural gas plant located in Missouri. The plant is expected to begin operations in 2030.\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Missouri West's applications for predetermination and Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) for their investments in these natural gas plants.\nRenewable Plant Investments\nEvergy Kansas Central intends to construct and own an approximately 159 MW solar generation facility to be located in Kansas and called Kansas Sky.  The solar generation facility is expected to begin operations by summer of 2027.  The construction of Kansas Sky is subject to the granting by the KCC of predetermination with reasonably acceptable terms and other closing conditions.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Evergy Missouri West entered into agreements to own two solar generation facilities currently under development.  The first facility, to be called Sunflower Sky, is a solar generation facility to be located in Kansas with an expected generating capacity of approximately 65 MW.  The second facility, to be called Foxtrot, is a solar generation facility to be located in Missouri with an expected generating capacity of approximately 100 MW.  The solar generation facilities are expected to begin operations by summer of 2027.  The agreements are subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the granting by the MPSC of a CCN with reasonably acceptable terms.\n39\nTable of Contents\n \nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Missouri West's applications for predetermination and CCN, respectively, for their investments in these renewable generating plants.\nRegulatory Proceedings\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding other regulatory proceedings.\nWolf Creek Refueling Outage and Fuel Supply\nWolf Creek's most recent refueling outage began in March 2024 and the unit returned to service in May 2024.  Wolf Creek's next refueling outage is planned to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025.  \nIn May 2024, President Biden signed into law the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, which limits the importation of uranium from the Russian Federation.  The Evergy Companies have a Russian-sourced contract beginning in 2025 to obtain nuclear fuel and have taken mitigating measures to minimize the impact of the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act to their supply chain.  The Evergy Companies do not expect a material impact to their supply chain or financial results.  See Part I, Item 1, Business - Fuel - Nuclear Fuel for additional information regarding Evergy's purchases of nuclear fuel.\nEarnings Overview\nThe following table summarizes Evergy's net income and diluted EPS.\n2024\nChange\n2023\n(millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc.\n$\n873.5 \n$\n142.2 \n$\n731.3 \nEarnings per common share, diluted\n3.79 \n0.62 \n3.17 \nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc. increased in 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to new Evergy Kansas Central retail rates effective in December 2023, the recognition of a $96.5 million regulatory liability in the third quarter of 2023 for future refund of amounts of revenues previously collected from customers related to COLI rate credits, higher transmission revenues and lower pension non-service costs; partially offset by higher taxes other than income tax, depreciation, interest, income tax and operating and maintenance expense and lower investment earnings in 2024.\nDiluted EPS increased in 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. discussed above.\nFor additional information regarding the change in net income, refer to the Evergy Results of Operations section within this MD&A. \nNon-GAAP Measures\nEvergy Utility Gross Margin (non-GAAP)\nUtility gross margin (non-GAAP) is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Utility gross margin (non-GAAP), as used by the Evergy Companies, is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs.  Expenses for fuel and purchased power costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms.  As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income.  In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by SPP members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO.  As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income.  The Evergy Companies' definition of utility gross margin (non-GAAP) may differ from similar terms used by other companies.\nUtility gross margin (non-GAAP) is intended to aid an investor's overall understanding of results.  Management believes that utility gross margin (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the Evergy Companies' \n40\nTable of Contents\n \noperations across periods because utility gross margin (non-GAAP) excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs and SPP network transmission costs.  Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board.  Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, gross margin, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Gross margin under GAAP is defined as the excess of sales over cost of goods sold.\nUtility gross margin (non-GAAP) differs from the GAAP definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance expenses determined to be directly attributable to revenue-producing activities, depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income tax.  See the Evergy Companies' Results of Operations for a reconciliation of utility gross margin (non-GAAP) to gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure.\nAdjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP)\nManagement believes that adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are representative measures of Evergy's recurring earnings, assists in the comparability of results and is consistent with how management reviews performance.\nEvergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) for 2024 were $877.9 million or $3.81 per share.  For 2023, Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) were $815.6 million or $3.54 per share.  \nIn addition to net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. and diluted EPS, Evergy's management uses adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) to evaluate earnings and EPS without:\ni.\nthe mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges related to Evergy Kansas Central's 8% ownership share of JEC; \nii.\nthe costs resulting from non-regulated energy marketing margins from the February 2021 winter weather event;\niii.\nthe second quarter 2023 recognition of a regulatory liability for the refund to customers of revenues previously collected since October 2019 for costs related to an electric subdivision rebate program to be refunded to customers in accordance with a June 2020 KCC order; \niv.\nthe recognition of a regulatory liability for future refund of amounts of revenues previously collected from customers related to COLI rate credits in accordance with a September 2023 KCC rate case unanimous settlement agreement; and\nv.\nthe costs incurred in the fourth quarter 2024 resulting from the realignment of the executive operations corporate structure.\nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are intended to aid an investor's overall understanding of results.  Management believes that adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for evaluating Evergy's operations across periods because it excludes certain items that management does not believe are indicative of Evergy's ongoing perf\normance or that can create period to period earnings volatility.  \nAd\njusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board.  Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. \n41\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table provides a reconciliation between net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. and diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP and adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP), respectively.\nEarnings (Loss)\nEarnings (Loss) per Diluted Share\nEarnings (Loss)\nEarnings (Loss) per Diluted Share\n2024\n2023\n(millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc.\n$\n873.5 \n$\n3.79 \n$\n731.3 \n$\n3.17 \nNon-GAAP reconciling items:\nMark-to-market impact of JEC economic hedges, pre-tax\n(a)\n2.6 \n0.01 \n8.7 \n0.04 \nNon-regulated energy marketing costs related to February 2021    winter weather event, pre-tax\n(b)\n— \n— \n0.3 \n— \nElectric subdivision rebate program costs refund, pre-tax\n(c)\n— \n— \n2.6 \n0.01 \nCustomer refunds related to COLI rate credits, pre-tax\n(d)\n— \n— \n96.5 \n0.42 \nExecutive operations team realignment, pre-tax\n(e)\n2.5 \n0.01 \n— \n— \nIncome tax benefit\n(f)\n(0.7)\n— \n(23.8)\n(0.10)\nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP)\n$\n877.9 \n$\n3.81 \n$\n815.6 \n$\n3.54 \n(a)\nReflects mark-to-market gains or losses related to forward contracts for natural gas and electricity entered into as economic hedges against fuel price volatility related to Evergy Kansas Central's 8% ownership share of Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC) that are included in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(b)\nReflects non-regulated energy marketing incentive compensation costs related to the February 2021 winter weather event that are included in operating and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n \n(c)\nReflects the second quarter 2023 recognition of a regulatory liability for the refund to customers of revenues previously collected since October 2019 for costs related to an electric subdivision rebate program to be refunded to customers in accordance with a June 2020 KCC order that are included in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(d)\nReflects the recognition of a regulatory liability for the refund to customers for amounts of revenues previously collected related to corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) rate credits in accordance with a September 2023 KCC rate case unanimous settlement agreement reached between Evergy, the KCC staff and other intervenors that are included in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(e)\nReflects costs incurred associated with the realignment of the executive operations corporate structure that are included in operating and maintenance expense and taxes other than income tax on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(f)\nReflects an income tax effect calculated at a statutory rate of approximately 22%, with the exception of certain non-deductible items.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding related party transactions.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been used, could have a material impact on Evergy's results of operations and financial position.  Management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of Evergy's results of operations and financial position.  Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Evergy Board.\n42\nTable of Contents\n \nPensions\nEvergy incurs significant costs in providing non-contributory defined pension benefits.  The costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience.\nPension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, life expectancies, compensation levels and employment periods), earnings on plan assets, the level of contributions made to the plan, and plan amendments.  In addition, pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.\nThe assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted-average of long-term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan.  The assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation.  These assumptions, updated annually at the measurement date, are based on management's best estimates and judgment; however, material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events.  See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease in key actuarial assumptions for Evergy's qualified pension plans.  Each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nImpact on\nImpact on\nProjected\n2025\nChange in\nBenefit\nPension\nActuarial assumption\nAssumption\nObligation\nExpense\n(millions)\nDiscount rate\n0.5 \n%\nincrease\n$\n(95.1)\n$\n(10.4)\nRate of return on plan assets\n0.5 \n%\nincrease\nN/A\n(6.5)\nRate of compensation\n0.5 \n%\nincrease\n22.2 \n4.8 \nDiscount rate\n0.5 \n%\ndecrease\n105.5 \n11.5 \nRate of return on plan assets\n0.5 \n%\ndecrease\nN/A\n6.5 \nRate of compensation\n0.5 \n%\ndecrease\n(20.9)\n(4.5)\nPension expense for Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC.  The orders allow the difference between pension costs under GAAP and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds, as appropriate.  \nIn 2024, Evergy's pension expense was $33.5 million under GAAP and $57.6 million for ratemaking.  The impact on 2025 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on GAAP pension costs.  Under the Evergy Companies' rate agreements, any increase or decrease in GAAP pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment.  See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan.  It is difficult to predict future pension costs, changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nEvergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice.  Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by Evergy.  \n43\nTable of Contents\n \nUnbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month.  This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs.  Evergy's estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates.  Evergy's unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes.  See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the balance of unbilled receivables for Evergy as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nEvergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues.  Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.\nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to Evergy; and changes in laws and regulations.  If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations.  Evergy's continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules.  In the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of Evergy's operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided.  Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets.  See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nImpairments of Assets and Goodwill\nLong-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP.\nAccounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists.  The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value.  Evergy's consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis.  The annual impairment test for the $2,336.6 million of goodwill from the merger that created Evergy was conducted as of May 1, 2024.  The fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill.  As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill. \nThe determination of fair value for the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies.  The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit, which involves a significant amount of management judgment.  \nThe discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions: estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.  Management determines the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).  The WACC takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the KCC and MPSC and after-tax cost of debt.  Estimated future cash flows are based on Evergy's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of return on equity, anticipated returns of and earnings on future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts.  Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the \n44\nTable of Contents\n \nexpected outcome of the aforementioned events.  Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of the Evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill. \nThe market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management's selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit, as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock.  Management determines an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry.  Changes in results of peer companies, selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the Evergy reporting unit.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property.  Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards.  Evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in Evergy's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.  Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities.  This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ.  Evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized.  See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nEvergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets.  Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective is also recorded to property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets.  The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability.\nEvergy initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (94% indirect share), retire wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills, among other items.  ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity.  In determining Evergy's AROs, assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence.  The results of these assumptions are discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates (CARFR).  The CARFR is determined as the current U.S. Treasury bonds rates corresponding to the period of expected settlement activities and is adjusted for the associated bond rates Evergy would be charged to borrow for the specific time period.  Any change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on Evergy's AROs reflected on its consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Evergy had recorded AROs of $1,297.0 million and $1,203.1 million, respectively.  See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's AROs.\n45\nTable of Contents\n \nEVERGY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nEvergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation, fuel costs, weather, level of capital investment, customer behavior and demand, the economy and competitive forces.   \nSubstantially all of Evergy's revenues are subject to state or federal regulation.  This regulation has a significant impact on the price the Evergy Companies charge for electric service.  Evergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending, both operating and capital, within the frameworks established by its regulators and to mitigate the impacts of inflationary pressures.  \nWholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather. \nThe Evergy Companies use coal, uranium and gas for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power through renewable power purchase agreements or on the open market.  The prices for fuel used in generation or the market price of power purchases can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply, demand, weather and the broader economic environment.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have fuel recovery mechanisms in their Kansas and Missouri jurisdictions, as applicable, that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding. \nWeather significantly affects the amount of electricity that Evergy's customers use as electricity sales are seasonal.  As summer peaking utilities, the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the Evergy Companies.  Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers.  Mild weather reduces customer demand. \nEnergy efficiency investments by customers and the Evergy Companies also can affect the demand for electric service.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their respective Kansas and Missouri retail customers and recover program costs, throughput disincentive, and as applicable, certain earnings opportunities in retail rates through a rider mechanism.\nThe Evergy Companies' taxes other than income taxes, of which property taxes are a significant component, can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including changes in taxable values and property tax rates.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have property tax surcharges or trackers that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in property tax costs from the amounts set in base rates.\n46\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table summarizes Evergy's comparative results of operations.\n2024\nChange\n2023\n \n(millions)\nOperating revenues\n$\n5,847.3 \n$\n339.1 \n$\n5,508.2 \nFuel and purchased power\n1,479.9 \n(14.9)\n1,494.8 \nSPP network transmission costs\n370.9 \n68.3 \n302.6 \nOperating and maintenance\n961.9 \n16.6 \n945.3 \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,114.0 \n37.5 \n1,076.5 \nTaxes other than income tax\n452.6 \n46.0 \n406.6 \nIncome from operations\n1,468.0 \n185.6 \n1,282.4 \nOther income (expense), net\n3.1 \n7.9 \n(4.8)\nInterest expense\n563.1 \n37.3 \n525.8 \nIncome tax expense\n30.0 \n14.4 \n15.6 \nEquity in earnings of equity method investees, net of income taxes\n7.8 \n0.4 \n7.4 \nNet income\n885.8 \n142.2 \n743.6 \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n12.3 \n— \n12.3 \nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc.\n$\n873.5 \n$\n142.2 \n$\n731.3 \nGross Margin (GAAP) and Utility Gross Margin (non-GAAP)\nThe following tables summarize Evergy's gross margin (GAAP) and MWhs sold and reconcile Evergy's gross margin (GAAP) to Evergy's utility gross margin (non-GAAP).

and\n49\nTable of Contents\n \n•\nan $11.6 million decrease due to recording lower Evergy Kansas Central COLI benefits in 2024.\nInterest Expense\nEvergy's interest expense increased $37.3 million in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily driven by:\n•\na $124.4 million increase due to issuances of long-term debt; partially offset by\n•\na $54.5 million decrease in interest expense on short-term borrowings primarily due to lower short-term debt balances in 2024; \n•\na $25.1 million decrease due to increases in carrying costs deferred to a regulatory asset in accordance with PISA due to a higher outstanding balance of qualified PISA additions and Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro electing into Kansas PISA beginning July 2024;

See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n•\nEvergy's pension and post-retirement liability decreased $92.8 million primarily due to a decrease in benefit obligations driven by an increase in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations as a result of higher market interest rates. \n•\nEvergy's asset retirement obligations - long-term increased $105.5 million primarily due to increases in ARO liabilities related to new EPA CCRs regulations and accretion. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \nEvergy relies primarily upon cash from operations, short-term borrowings, debt, equity and equity-like issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its capital requirements.  Evergy's capital requirements primarily consist of capital expenditures, payment of contractual obligations and other commitments and the payment of dividends to shareholders.  In addition, tax legislation and regulation could result in significant impacts to cash flow. \nCapital Sources\nCash Flows from Operations\nEvergy's cash flows from operations are driven by the regulated sale of electricity.  These cash flows are relatively stable but the timing and level of these cash flows can vary based on weather and economic conditions, future regulatory proceedings, the timing of cash payments made for costs recoverable under regulatory mechanisms and the time such costs are recovered, and unanticipated expenses such as unplanned plant outages and storms.  Evergy's cash flows from operations were $1,983.7 million, $1,980.2 million and $1,801.9 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nAs of December 31, 2024, Evergy had $1.3 billion of available borrowing capacity under its master credit facility.  The available borrowing capacity under the master credit facility consisted of $223.9 million for Evergy, Inc., $301.7 million for Evergy Kansas Central, $440.3 million for Evergy Metro and $323.8 million for Evergy Missouri West.  The Evergy Companies' borrowing capacity under the master credit facility also supports their issuance of commercial paper.  See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the master credit facility.\nAlong with cash flows from operations and receivable sales facilities, Evergy generally uses borrowings under its master credit facility and the issuance of commercial paper to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements.  Evergy believes that its existing cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its master credit facility provide sufficient liquidity for its existing capital requirements.\n51\nTable of Contents\n \nLong-Term Debt, Equity and Equity-like Issuances\nFrom time to time, Evergy issues long-term debt, equity and equity-like securities to repay short-term debt, refinance maturing long-term debt and finance growth.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Evergy's capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nCommon equity\n44%\n45%\nLong-term debt, including VIEs\n56%\n55%\nUnder stipulations with the MPSC and KCC, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro are required to maintain common equity at not less than 35%, 40% and 40%, respectively, of total capitalization.  The master credit facility and certain debt instruments of the Evergy Companies also contain restrictions that require the maintenance of certain capitalization and leverage ratios.  As of December 31, 2024, the Evergy Companies were in compliance with these covenants.\nThe Evergy Companies expect that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of equity and equity-like securities will be adequate to meet anticipated cash needs over the next five years.\nDebt Issuances\nEvergy expects to issue approximately $9.7 billion of securities through debt capital markets between 2025 and 2029, subject to market conditions, which includes refinancing $3.9 billion of long-term debt maturities.  See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding significant debt issuances.\nEquity Issuances\nEvergy expects to issue $2.8 billion of equity and equity-like securities between 2026 and 2029, subject to market conditions. \nCredit Ratings\nThe ratings of the Evergy Companies' debt securities by the credit rating agencies impact the Evergy Companies' liquidity, including the cost of borrowings under their master credit facility and in the capital markets.  The Evergy Companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as vital to their access to and cost of debt financing and, to that end, maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations, financial position and future prospects.  While a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of the Evergy Companies' debt, it could increase interest charges under the master credit facility.  A decrease in credit ratings could also have, among other things, an adverse impact, which could be material, on the Evergy Companies' access to capital, the cost of funds, the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings, the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and Evergy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries.  \n52\nTable of Contents\n \nAs of February 26, 2025, the major credit rating agencies rated the Evergy Companies' securities as detailed in the following table.\nMoody's\nS&P Global\nInvestors Service\n(a)\nRatings\n(a)\nEvergy\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nCorporate Credit Rating\n--\nBBB+\nSenior Unsecured Debt\nBaa2\nBBB\nJunior Subordinated Note\nBaa3\nBBB-\nCommercial Paper\nP-2\nA-2\nEvergy Kansas Central\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nCorporate Credit Rating\nBaa1\nBBB+\nSenior Secured Debt\nA2\nA\nCommercial Paper\nP-2\nA-2\nEvergy Kansas South\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nCorporate Credit Rating\nBaa1\nBBB+\nSenior Secured Debt\nA2\nA\nShort-Term Rating\nP-2\nA-2\nEvergy Metro\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nCorporate Credit Rating\nBaa1\nA-\nSenior Secured Debt\nA2\nA\nSenior Unsecured Debt\n--\nA-\nCommercial Paper\nP-2\nA-2\nEvergy Missouri West\nOutlook\nNegative\nStable\nCorporate Credit Rating\nBaa2\nBBB+\nSenior Secured Debt \nA3\nA\nCommercial Paper \nP-2\nA-2\n(a)\nA securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.\nShelf Registration Statements and Regulatory Authorizations\nEvergy\nIn August 2024, Evergy filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC.

Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West must comply with these restrictions prior to the issuance of additional FMBs, mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.  \nUnder the Evergy Kansas Central mortgage, the issuance of FMBs is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions.  In addition, so long as any bonds issued prior to January 1, 1997, remain outstanding, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Evergy Kansas Central’s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property retirement (which, as defined, does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries), for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance, are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance.  As of December 31, 2024, $420.5 million principal amount of additional FMBs could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nUnder the Evergy Kansas South mortgage, the amount of FMBs authorized is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion and the issuance of FMBs is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions.  In addition, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Evergy Kansas South's net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one-half times the annual interest charges on \n54\nTable of Contents\n \nor 10% of the principal amount of all Evergy Kansas South FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $2,878.6 million principal amount of additional Evergy Kansas South FMBs could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nUnder the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of December 1, 1986, as supplemented (Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture), additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds may be issued on the basis of 75% of property additions or retired bonds.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $5,552.7 million principal amount of additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage.\nUnder the First Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of March 1, 2022 (Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture), additional Evergy Missouri West mortgage bonds may be issued on the basis of 75% of property additions or retired bonds.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $2,137.2 million principal amount of additional Evergy Missouri West mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2024, Evergy had approximately $22.0 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nNuclear Production Tax Credit\nIn 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law providing a transferable Production Tax Credit (PTC) for electricity produced by existing nuclear power plants, including Wolf Creek, from 2024 through 2032. The credit may be used to offset Evergy's income tax liability or be transferred to an unrelated third party.  The IRS is expected to provide guidance regarding the type of revenue to be included in the gross receipts portion of the credit computation, which could have a significant impact on the value of the nuclear PTCs available to Evergy.  If Evergy is able to monetize the nuclear PTCs, it could result in significant cash inflows.  However, the tax benefits, if any, are expected to be returned to customers over time as a reduction to revenue in future regulatory proceedings.  See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the nuclear PTC.\nCapital Requirements\nCapital Expenditures\nEvergy expects to access the debt and equity markets for significant amounts of capital to fund the infrastructure investments outlined in the table below.  The investments are part of Evergy's long-term strategy focused on affordability, reliability and sustainability, including the responsible transition of its generation fleet and in anticipation of growing demand in its service territory.  These investments include other utility construction programs required to maintain Evergy's electric utility operations, ensure reliability, retire or convert older plants and expand facilities related to providing electric service.  These capital expenditures could include, but are not limited to, expenditures to develop new transmission lines and make improvements to or investments in power plants, transmission and distribution lines and equipment.

The bondholders of these tax-exempt bonds are permitted to tender the tax-exempt bonds to the issuer for purchase and, if tendered, the issuer is obligated to purchase any such bonds that cannot be remarketed to other investors.  These tax-exempt bonds are classified as long-term debt due to the issuer's intent and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term financing.  Long-term debt principal excludes $112.7 million of unamortized net discounts and debt issuance costs and a $81.7 million fair value adjustment recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the merger that created Evergy in 2018.  Variable rate interest obligations are based on rates as of December 31, 2024.  \nEvergy expects to contribute $65.3 million to the pension and other post-retirement plans in 2025, of which the majority is expected to be paid by Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.  Additional contributions to the plans are expected beyond 2029 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined.  Amounts for years after 2025 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2025.  Actual amounts for years after 2025 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above.\n56\nTable of Contents\n \nFuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation costs.  Power commitments consist of certain commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements, capacity purchases and firm transmission service.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Evergy has other insignificant commitments as well as other insignificant long-term liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet, which are not included in the table above.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nThe amount and timing of dividends payable on Evergy's common stock are within the sole discretion of the Evergy Board.  The amount and timing of dividends declared by the Evergy Board will be dependent on considerations such as Evergy's earnings, financial position, cash flows, capitalization ratios, regulation, reinvestment opportunities and debt covenants.  Evergy targets a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%.  See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the common stock dividend declared by the Evergy Board in February 2025.\nThe Evergy Companies also have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels.
