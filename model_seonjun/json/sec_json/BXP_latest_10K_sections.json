BXP was formed in 1997 to succeed the real estate development, redevelopment, acquisition, management, operating and leasing businesses associated with the predecessor company founded by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in 1970.\nOur properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets—Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  At December 31, 2024, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 185 commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 53.3 million net rentable square feet of primarily premier workplaces, including seven properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 2.3 million net rentable square feet.  As of December 31, 2024, our properties consisted of:\n \n•\n163 office and life sciences properties (including five properties under construction/redevelopment);\n•\n14 retail properties (including one property under construction);\n•\nseven residential properties (including one property under construction); and\n•\none hotel.\nWe consider premier workplaces to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings, are professionally managed and maintained, and offer a number and type of amenities that are in high demand by clients that are focused on the importance of the physical work environment in recruiting and retaining the best and brightest employees.  As such, these properties attract creditworthy clients and command upper-tier rental rates in their markets.  We do not consider the expression “premier workplaces” a classification of our properties in accordance with any standard listing criteria in the real estate industry.  We therefore caution investors that our use and definition of “premier workplaces” may be different than the use and definition of similar expressions and traditional classifications that may be used by other companies.\nWe are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, risk management, tax and legal services.  For this reason, we refer to our tenants as “clients” due to the many facets of our continuous engagements with them, which span beyond the usual tenant/landlord relationship.  Throughout this Annual Report, we use the terms “tenant” and “client” interchangeably.\nBXP manages BPLP as its sole general partner.  Our principal executive office and Boston regional office are located at The Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and our telephone number is (617) 236-3300.  In addition, we have regional offices at 2800 28th Street, Santa Monica, California 90405, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, Two Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111, 1001 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98154 and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20037.\nOur internet address is http://www.bxp.com.

You may also obtain BXP’s and BPLP’s reports by accessing the EDGAR database at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov, or we will furnish an electronic or paper copy of these reports free of charge upon written request to: Investor Relations, BXP, Inc., Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199.  “Boston Properties” is a registered trademark, BXP is a registered trademark, and the “bxp” logo is a registered trademark, in all cases, owned by BPLP.\nBoston Properties Limited Partnership\nBPLP is a Delaware limited partnership organized in 1997, and the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets.  BXP is the sole general partner of BPLP and, as of February 21, 2025, the owner of approximately 89.5% of the economic interests in BPLP.  Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP \n3\nTable of Contents\n     \nowned by BXP as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP and (2) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP (“LTIP Units”), for which all performance conditions have been satisfied for such conversion.  We exclude from (1) and (2) above other LTIP Units issued in the form of Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards in 2023 or later (“MYLTIP Awards”), which remain subject to performance conditions.  An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of BXP’s restricted common stock, although LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10th) of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned.\nTransactions During 2024 \nAcquisitions\nOn January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue, located in Washington, DC.  At acquisition, the total net equity acquired was $20.0 million, which includes $10.0 million in cash that we paid for the joint venture partner's 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture.  The property is subject to existing mortgage indebtedness of approximately $207.1 million (see “\nSecured Debt\n” below).  The acquisition resulted in us recording a gain upon consolidation of approximately $21.8 million, which is the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity method investment immediately prior to the consolidation of $10.0 million, less our costs basis of approximately $(11.8) million.  The gain on consolidation is included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statement of Operations (See Notes 3, 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  901 New York Avenue is a premier workplace consisting of approximately 508,000 net rentable square feet.  \nOn December 27, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 725 12th Street, an approximately 300,000 net rentable square foot, 12-story premier workplace located in Washington, DC, for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $34.0 million.  The acquisition was completed with available cash.  Following the acquisition, we commenced redevelopment of the property.  When completed, 725 12th Street is expected to total approximately 320,000 net rentable square feet of office and retail space.  The project is 47% pre-leased as of February 21, 2025.\nPending\n Disposition and Impairment\nAt March 31, 2024, we evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of our Shady Grove property,  consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel, located in Rockville, Maryland.  Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that we anticipate selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024.  As a result, each of BXP and BPLP recognized an impairment loss of approximately $13.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.  Our estimated fair value was based on Level 3 inputs as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 and the terms of a pending offer from a third-party.  \nOn May 7, 2024, we entered into an agreement with the third-party developer for the sale of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and the land parcel, located in Rockville, Maryland, for an aggregate gross sale price of approximately $24.8 million.  On July 22, 2024, we executed an amendment to the agreement for an aggregate gross sale price of approximately $24.7 million.  2 Choke Cherry Road and 2094 Gaither Road are two vacant office properties aggregating approximately 143,000 net rentable square feet that were taken out of service and held for redevelopment.  The disposition is subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions and there can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummated on the terms currently contemplated or at all.\nDevelopments\n/Redevelopments\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had seven properties under construction/redevelopment, which we expect will total approximately 2.3 million net rentable square feet when completed.  We estimate our share of the aggregate total investment to complete these projects is approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion remained to be invested as of December 31, 2024.  The total development pipeline, including office, laboratory/life sciences and retail developments, but excluding our residential development 121 Broadway Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is 50% pre-leased as of February 21, 2025.  For a detailed list of the properties under construction/redevelopment see \n“Liquidity and Capital Resources” \nwithin\n “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” \n4\nTable of Contents\n     \nOn February 12, 2024, we commenced the development of a residential project at 121 Broadway Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts that is adjacent to our development projects at 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street.  121 Broadway will consist of 439 residential units aggregating approximately 492,000 net rentable square feet.  There can be no assurance that we will complete development of the project on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nOn April 5, 2024, we completed and fully placed in-service 760 Boylston Street, an approximately 118,000 net rentable square foot retail redevelopment located in Boston, Massachusetts.  \nOn July 17, 2024, we partially placed in-service Reston Next Office Phase II, an approximately 90,000 net rentable square foot development project comprised of office and retail space located in Reston, Virginia.  \nOn September 26, 2024, we fully placed in-service 180 CityPoint, an approximately 329,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project located in Waltham, Massachusetts.  \nOn October 5, 2024, we fully placed in-service 103 CityPoint, an approximately 113,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project located in Waltham, Massachusetts.\nOn October 31, 2024, we completed and fully placed in-service 300 Binney Street, a laboratory/life sciences redevelopment project with approximately 240,000 net rentable square feet located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  \nLeases\nOn March 28, 2024, we entered into a 90-year air rights lease with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation for an approximately 61,000 square foot site at the parking garage located at 100 Clarendon Street and the concourse level of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Back Bay Station (the “Station”).  The lease requires annual base rental payments of $250,000 until the commencement of construction, as defined in the lease.  If we commence construction of a project on the site on or before August 1, 2028 then a final fixed rental payment is due in accordance with the lease at that time.  After August 1, 2028, if we commence construction of a project on the site, then a final rental payment based on the then current fair market value will be due at that time.  In addition, the lease requires annual payments of $500,000 through 2033 to fund maintenance and improvements to the Station.  We have assumed that we will begin construction on the site on or before August 1, 2028.  The incremental borrowing rate for this lease is 6.57% per annum.  The net present value of the ground lease payments is approximately $23.2 million.  We classify this lease as an operating lease.  As a result, we recorded a Right of Use Assets – Operating Leases and Lease Liabilities – Operating Leases of approximately $23.9 million and $23.2 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2024.  The ground lease had operating lease costs of approximately $0.3 million for the period from March 28, 2024 through December 31, 2024.  There can be no assurance that we will commence construction on the ground lease site on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nWe have a ground lease for the land underlying our residential property, The Skylyne, in Oakland, California.  The Skylyne is a residential property consisting of 402 residential units and supporting retail space totaling approximately 331,000 net rentable square feet.  The ground lease has approximately 92 years remaining (including extension options) and provides us with the right to purchase the land subject to certain conditions.  When the lease was executed in 2017, the purchase option was considered a bargain purchase option and, as a result, we classified it as a finance lease and we assumed the lessor would exercise its right to require us to purchase the land in May 2024 for approximately $38.7 million.  In May 2024 and as of the date of this report, the lessor has not exercised this option and we reassessed the accounting for the ground lease and determined that the purchase option continues to be considered a bargain purchase option and the ground lease will continue to be accounted for as a finance lease.  The lease requires monthly base rental payments of a nominal amount until the purchase occurs, which we now estimate will be in 2030.  As a result of the reassessment, the lease liability was remeasured and reduced to approximately $0.1 million.  In conjunction with the reduction in the lease liability, the right of use asset was reduced to $0 and the difference between the lease liability and right of use asset, before the remeasurement, of approximately $9.5 million was recorded as a decrease to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.  There can be no assurance that we will ultimately exercise the ground lease purchase option on the schedule currently contemplated or at all. \nSecured Debt\nOn January 8, 2024, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial \n5\nTable of Contents\n     \nStatements).  The property is subject to existing mortgage indebtedness.  At acquisition, the mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $207.1 million, bore interest at 3.61% per annum and was scheduled to mature on January 5, 2025.  The mortgage loan was recorded at a fair value of approximately $198.7 million.  On January 11, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan to provide for two extension options totaling five years of additional term, each subject to certain conditions.  On December 20, 2024, we exercised the first extension option to extend the maturity date to January 5, 2029.  At the time of the extension, the outstanding principal balance was $202.3 million.  The extended loan will bear interest at 5.00% per annum beginning January 5, 2025.  The loan has a one-year extension option remaining, subject to certain conditions.\nOn October 8, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan collateralized by our Santa Monica Business Park properties located in Santa Monica, California.  The mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of $200.0 million, bore interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 19, 2025.  The modified loan is scheduled to mature on October 8, 2028 and continues to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum until July 19, 2025.  Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.60% per annum through the maturity date.  The entire principal is subject to interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 2.675% per annum through April 1, 2025 (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The mortgage loan requires monthly interest-only payments during the term of the loan, with the entire principal due at maturity.  Santa Monica Business Park is an office park consisting of 21 buildings totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet.\nUnsecured\n Debt\nOn February 1, 2024, BPLP repaid $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% senior notes due February 1, 2024.  The repayment was completed with available cash.  The repayment price was approximately $713.3 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date.  Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid.  \nOn April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program.  Under the terms of the program, BPLP may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $500.0 million with varying maturities of up to one year.  Amounts available under the unsecured commercial paper program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time.  The notes are sold in private placements and rank pari passu with all of BPLP’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, including its outstanding senior notes.  The commercial paper program is backstopped by available capacity under BPLP’s unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2021 Credit Facility”).  At December 31, 2024, BPLP had an aggregate of $500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding that bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.79% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 38 days from the issuance date. \nOn April 29, 2024, BPLP repaid $500.0 million of the outstanding balance of its $1.2 billion unsecured term loan facility (the “2023 Unsecured Term Loan”) from the proceeds of its unsecured commercial paper program.  On May 16, 2024, BPLP exercised its option to extend the maturity date of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan to May 16, 2025.  All other terms of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan remain unchanged (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \nOn April 29, 2024, BPLP increased the maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility from $1.815 billion to $2.0 billion.  All other terms of the 2021 Credit Facility, including its maturity date of June 15, 2026, remain unchanged (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \nOn August 26, 2024, BPLP completed a public offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035.  The notes were priced at 99.961% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 5.842% per annum to maturity.  The notes will mature on January 15, 2035, unless earlier redeemed.  The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $841.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.\nOn September 27, 2024, BPLP entered into a credit agreement that provides for a $100.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the “2024 Unsecured Term Loan”) with a lender (the “Lender”) under the mortgage loan collateralized by our Santa Monica Business Park properties located in Santa Monica, California (the “SMBP Loan”).  Upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw $100.0 million under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan.  The proceeds were used to modify and repay the portion of the SMBP Loan held by the Lender.  After \n6\nTable of Contents\n     \nthe repayment, the SMBP Loan had a remaining principal balance of $200.0 million.  The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan matures on September 26, 2025 with three, one-year extension options, subject to customary conditions (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \nEquity Transactions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, BXP acquired an aggregate of 1,147,013 common units of limited partnership interest, including a total of 122,241 common units issued upon the conversion of LTIP Units, 2012 outperformance plan awards (“2012 OPP Units”) and 2013 - 2019 multi-year, long-term incentive program awards, presented by the holders for redemption, in exchange for an equal number of shares of BXP common stock.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOn January 2, 2024, a joint venture in which we have a 50% ownership interest partially placed in-service 651 Gateway, an approximately 327,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project in South San Francisco, California.  This property was fully placed in-service on January 2, 2025. \nOn January 8, 2024, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue, located in Washington, DC, for a gross purchase price of $10.0 million in cash (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Prior to the acquisition, we had a 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting. The acquisition resulted in us having full ownership of the joint venture such that we now account for its assets, liabilities, and operations on a consolidated basis in our financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting.  As a result, we recognized a gain on consolidation of approximately $21.8 million.\nOn February 6, 2024, a joint venture in which we have a 25% ownership interest extended the maturity date of the loan collateralized by its 3 Hudson Boulevard property.  At the time of the extension, the loan had an outstanding principal balance totaling $80.0 million and was scheduled to mature on February 9, 2024.  The extended loan was scheduled to mature on May 9, 2024.  On May 8, 2024, the loan was extended 30 days and on June 7, 2024, the loan was extended an additional 60 days.  The extended loan continued to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Term SOFR plus approximately 3.61% per annum and matured on August 7, 2024.  As of December 31, 2024, the loan was in a maturity default and had an outstanding balance, including accrued and unpaid interest and default interest of approximately $119.6 million.  The joint venture is negotiating a new third-party loan, however, there can be no assurance that the joint venture will enter into a new third-party loan on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.  We are the lender of the loan and the loan and accrued interest are reflected as Related Party Note Receivables, Net  and Tenant and Other Receivables, Net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  3 Hudson Boulevard consists of land and improvements held for future development located in New York, New York.\nOn February 9, 2024, a joint venture in which we have a 50% ownership interest exercised an option to extend the maturity date of the construction loan collateralized by its 7750 Wisconsin Avenue property.  The construction loan had a total commitment amount of approximately $252.6 million.  The extended loan continues to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Term SOFR plus 1.35% per annum and matures on April 26, 2025.  At the time of the extension, the loan had an outstanding balance totaling approximately $251.6 million and was scheduled to mature on April 26, 2024.  7750 Wisconsin Avenue is a premier workplace with approximately 736,000 net rentable square feet located in Bethesda, Maryland.\nOn July 18, 2024, a joint venture in which we have a 50% ownership interest extended by one year the maturity date of its loan collateralized by 100 Causeway Street.  At the time of the extension, the loan had an outstanding balance totaling approximately $333.6 million, bore interest at Term SOFR plus 1.48% per annum, and was scheduled to mature on September 5, 2024.  Following the extension, the loan will continue to bear interest at Term SOFR plus 1.48% per annum, and is scheduled to mature on September 5, 2025.  100 Causeway Street is an approximately 634,000 net rentable square foot premier workplace located in Boston, Massachusetts.\nOn August 7, 2024, a joint venture in which we have a 71.11% ownership interest partially placed in-service 360 Park Avenue South, a 20-story, premier workplace with ground floor retail located in New York City, New York, aggregating approximately 450,000 net rentable square feet.  On December 13, 2024, the joint venture extended the maturity date of its mortgage loan by three years.  At the time of the extension, the loan had an outstanding balance totaling approximately $220.0 million, bore interest at Adjusted Term SOFR plus 2.40% per annum, and was scheduled to mature on December 14, 2024.  Following the extension, the loan bears interest at Term SOFR plus 2.50% per annum, and is scheduled to mature on December 13, 2027. \n7\nTable of Contents\n     \nOn December 13, 2024, a joint venture in which we have a 20% ownership interest fully placed in-service Skymark, a luxury residential property located in Reston, Virginia, that consists of 508 residential units aggregating approximately 417,000 net rentable square feet across a five-story, low-rise building and an iconic 39-story tower, which is one of the tallest buildings in Northern Virginia. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments in Colorado Center, Gateway Commons and Safeco Plaza of approximately $168.4 million, $126.1 million and $46.8 million, respectively (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNoncontrolling\n Interest \nOn March 21, 2024, we completed the sale of a 45% interest in 290 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  We retain a 55% ownership interest in the joint venture.  The institutional investor funded approximately $97.2 million in cash at closing, which is less than 45% of the agreed upon carrying value of the property immediately prior to the transaction.  The institutional investor will fund all construction costs until its equity balance is proportionate to its ownership percentage, after which we and the institutional investor will fund the development project based on our respective ownership interests.  As of December 31, 2024, the equity balance for each of the investors is proportionate to their ownership percentage.  The transaction did not qualify as a sale of real estate for financial reporting purposes as we continue to effectively control the property and thus will continue to account for the property on a consolidated basis in our financial statements and no gain was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  We provide customary development, property management and leasing services to the joint venture.  290 Binney Street is an approximately 573,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \nStock Option and Incentive Plan\nOn January 25, 2024, the Compensation Committee of BXP’s Board of Directors approved a new equity-based, multi-year, long-term incentive program (the “2024 MYLTIP”) as a performance based component of our overall compensation program under the BXP, Inc. 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) to certain executive officers of BXP.  Under ASC 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” the 2024 MYLTIP awards have an aggregate value of approximately $11.1 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings under the graded vesting method. (See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nOn February 1, 2024, the three-year measurement period for our 2021 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s absolute and relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be 112% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $12.6 million (after giving effect to employee separations).  As a result, an aggregate of 155,625 2021 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited.\nBusiness and Growth Strategies\nBusiness Strategies \nOur primary business objective is to maximize return on investment to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return at all points of the economic cycle.  Our strategies to achieve this objective are:\n•\nto target a few carefully selected dynamic gateway markets—Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC—and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, developers, owners and managers in each of those markets with a full-service office in each market providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise.  We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective clients in various industries and where clients have demonstrated a preference for premier workplaces and other facilities.  Additionally, our markets have historically been able to recruit new talent to them and as such created job growth that results in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time.  We have explored, and may continue to explore for future investment, select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits;  \n•\nto emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, \n8\nTable of Contents\n     \nfinance and manage high-quality office and life sciences space, as well as selected retail and residential space;\n•\nto take on complex, technically challenging development projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue;\n•\nto own and develop high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today’s clients who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, including those amenities that enrich in-person experiences and support a hybrid work environment, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients;\n•\nto opportunistically acquire assets that increase our market share in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate, as well as potential new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and leasing;\n•\nto explore joint venture or lending opportunities with existing property owners located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital;\n•\nto pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein, including core properties, to either (1) take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or (2) pare from our portfolio properties that we believe have slower future growth potential;\n•\nto seek third-party development contracts to enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and\n•\nto enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations.\nGrowth Strategies\nExternal Growth Strategies\nWe believe that our development experience, our organizational depth, utilization of our joint venture partner relationships and our balance sheet position us to continue to selectively develop a range of premier workplaces, including high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments (including office, residential and retail), low-rise suburban office and residential properties and life sciences space, within budget and on schedule.  We believe we are also well-positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions.  From time to time, we remove from service select office assets for which we believe we have better uses, such as residential developments.  Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:\n•\nour control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire and properties removed from our in-service portfolio in anticipation of future redevelopment) in our markets that could support approximately 19.5 million additional square feet of new development;\n•\nour reputation gained through 55 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;\n•\nour relationships with leading national corporations, universities and public institutions, including government agencies, seeking new facilities and development services;\n•\nour relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry;\n•\nour track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas;\n•\nour ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; \n9\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nour relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets;\n•\nour ability to procure entitlements from multiple municipalities to develop sites and attract land owners to sell or partner with us; and\n•\nour relationship with domestic and foreign investors who seek to partner with companies like ours.\nOpportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories:\n•\nDevelopment in selected submarkets.\n We believe the selected development of well-positioned premier workplaces as well as residential buildings and mixed-use complexes may be justified in our markets.  We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that should allow for its development at the appropriate time.  While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 55-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms.  We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land or buildings with development or redevelopment potential.\nIn the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development.  Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value.  We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment.\nOur strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities.  We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles.\n•\nAcquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions, including lenders, or individuals.\n We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria.  In addition, we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions.  Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt.  We are also able to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution.  Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or BXP’s common stock may facilitate these types of acquisitions on a tax-efficient basis.  Existing promulgated Treasury regulations may limit the tax benefits previously available to sellers in some variations of these transactions.\n•\nAcquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets\n. We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions, owners of real estate and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies, repositioning/redevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program. \nInternal Growth Strategies\nWe believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties through an increase in occupancy and rental rates because they are of high quality and in desirable locations.  Additionally, our markets have diversified economies that have historically experienced job growth and increased use of office space, resulting in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time.  Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage clients to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost \n10\nTable of Contents\n     \nefficiency in replacing departing clients through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant and capital improvements and (3) to work with new or existing clients with space expansion or contraction needs, leveraging our expertise and clustering of assets to maximize the cash flow from our assets.  We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:\n \n•\nCultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit clients.\n In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers and amenities, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors.\nAt December 31, 2024, the weighted-average lease term of our in-place leases based on square feet, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.8 years and we continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality, financially stable clients.  In 2024, we executed approximately 5.6 million square feet of leases with a weighted-average lease term of 9.8 years.  Based on leases in place at December 31, 2024, leases with respect to approximately 7.0% of the total square feet in our portfolio, including unconsolidated joint ventures, will expire in calendar year 2025.\n \n•\nDirectly manage our office properties to maximize the potential for client retention.\n We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to client needs.  We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in client relations.  In addition, we reinvest in our properties by adding new services and amenities that are desirable to our clients.  \n•\nReplace clients quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs\n. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new clients and achieve relatively high rental and occupancy rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to clients, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets.\n•\nExtend terms of existing leases to existing clients prior to expiration\n. We have also successfully structured early client renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy clients on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships.\n•\nRe-development of existing assets. \n \nWe believe the select re-development of assets within our portfolio, where through the ability to increase the building size and/or to increase cash flow and generate appropriate returns on incremental investment after consideration of the asset’s current and future cash flows, may be desirable. This generally occurs in situations in which we are able to increase the building’s size, improve building systems, including conversion to higher yielding life sciences uses, and sustainability features, and/or add client amenities, thereby increasing client demand, generating acceptable returns on incremental investment and enhancing the long-term value of the property and the company.  In the past, we have been particularly successful at gaining local government approval for increased density at several of our assets, providing the opportunity to enhance value at a particular location.  Our strong regional relationships and recognized re-development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities.  We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn attractive returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles.\nSustainability\nOur Strategy\nWe are committed to maximizing long-term value for our shareholders through, among other strategies, actively working to promote our growth and operations sustainably and responsibly across our six dynamic gateway markets.  BXP’s sustainability strategy is to conduct our business, the development, ownership and operation of new and existing buildings, in a manner that contributes to positive outcomes for our clients, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve (collectively, our “stakeholders”).  Our investment philosophy is shaped by our core strategy of long-term ownership and our commitment to our communities and the centers of commerce \n11\nTable of Contents\n     \nand civic life that make them thrive.  We are focused on developing and maintaining healthy, high-performance buildings, while simultaneously mitigating operational costs and the potential external impacts of energy, water, waste, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and climate change.  Through our efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment while mutually benefiting our stakeholders.\nSustainability Leadership\nBXP is a widely recognized industry leader in sustainability, and our 2024 highlights include:\n•\nBXP ranked among the top real estate companies in the GRESB assessment, earning a ninth consecutive 5-star rating. 2024 was the thirteenth consecutive year that BXP earned the GRESB “Green Star” designation\n•\nBXP maintained an MSCI rating of “AA” and a CDP score of “B” \n•\nBXP was named to \nNewsweek’s \nAmerica’s Most Responsible Companies for the fifth consecutive year, ranking 83rd out of 600 companies, and was also named to \nNewsweek’s \nAmerica’s Greenest Companies with a 4.5-star rating\n•\nBXP was named a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) North America for the fourth consecutive year. BXP was one of eight real estate companies that qualified and the only office REIT in the index, scoring in the 93rd percentile of the real estate companies assessed for inclusion \n•\nBXP was recognized as one of \nTIME Magazine’s\n World’s Most Sustainable Companies, ranking 79th out of 500 companies and the highest-rated United States property owner\n•\nBXP earned Nareit’s Leader in the Light Office award, in addition to Nareit’s Sustainability Impact Award - Sustainable Design for 140 Kendrick Street - Building A\n•\nBXP was named an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year – Sustained Excellence Award Winner\n•\nBXP continued its tenure as an inaugural Platinum Level Green Lease Leader by the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy \nOur leadership position is due, in part, to our establishment of environmental goals, the periodic reporting of progress toward our goals and the achievement of these goals, which we report in an annual Sustainability & Impact Report that is made available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading “Commitment”.  We have publicly adopted energy, water, building certification, waste and GHG emissions goals, including a commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations (for direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions) by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control.  We have also provided climate-related disclosures aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”).  Detailed information on these goals and targets and our TCFD disclosures are included in our Sustainability & Impact Reports. We expect to publish our next report in April 2025.\nThe Sustainability & Impact Reports and the related information contained on our website (or that can be accessed through our website) are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) Disclosures\nThe Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by SASB in 2018 proposed sustainability accounting metrics designed for disclosure in mandatory filings, such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and serves as the framework against which we have aligned our disclosures for sustainability information.  The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area (“Energy Intensity”); percentage of the eligible portfolio that is certified ENERGY STAR® (“ENERGY STAR certified”); total energy consumed by portfolio area (“Total Energy Consumption”); water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area (“Water Intensity”); and total water withdrawn by portfolio area (“Total Water Consumption”).  Our energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters and is assured by an independent, third-party assurance expert, which includes all 2023 SASB  energy and water metrics.  During the 2024 calendar year, 69 buildings representing 59% of total in-service portfolio were ENERGY STAR certified.  A licensed professional has verified all ENERGY STAR applications.\n12\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe charts below detail our Energy Intensity, Total Energy Consumption, Water Intensity and Total Water Consumption for 2015 through 2023 for which data were available on occupied and actively managed office buildings where we had operational control.\n1,2,3,4,5,6\n \n \n_______________\n(1)\nFull 2024 calendar year energy and water data will not be available and assured by a third party until April 2025. Therefore, 2023 is the most recent year for which complete and third-party assured energy and water data is available.\n(2)\nThe charts reflect the performance of our occupied and actively managed office portfolio.  We define “occupied buildings” as those with no more than 50% vacancy. Actively managed office buildings are multi-tenant buildings over which we have operational control of building system performance and investment decisions.  At the end of the 2023 calendar year, our occupied and actively managed office portfolio included 77 buildings totaling 40.8 million gross square feet, and it accounted for approximately 75% of BXP’s total in-service portfolio by area.\n(3)\nFloor area is considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage when we obtain energy consumption data (i.e., energy types and amounts consumed) for all types of energy consumed in the relevant floor area during the calendar year, regardless of when such data was obtained.\n(4)\nThe scope of energy includes energy purchased from sources external to us and our clients or produced by us or our clients and energy from all sources, including fuel, gas, electricity and steam.  Energy use intensity (kBtu/SF) has been weather-normalized.\n(5)\nWater sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by BXP, municipal water supplies or supply from other water utilities.\n(6)\n2020 and 2021 data reflect the combined impacts of efficiency measures, renewable energy and reduced physical occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Occupancy was not significantly reduced in 2023.\nHuman\n Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 710 non-union employees and 106 union employees.  Because the unions control the primary aspects of the hiring process, except as otherwise noted, all data provided in this Human Capital Management section refers to BXP’s non-union employee workforce only. \nOur operational and financial performance depends on the talents, energy, experience and well-being of our employees.  Our ability to attract and retain talented people depends on a number of factors, including work environment, career development and professional training, compensation and benefits, and the health, safety and wellness of our employees.\nOur workforce provides a strategic business advantage as it is one of our most valuable assets.  We are committed to the quality, growth and development of our people as part of our strategy to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We aim to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to make their maximum contribution to us and to their own career goals. It has been, and will continue to be, our policy to recruit, hire, assign, promote and train in all job titles without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations. Our hiring practices do not, and have not, included quotas or numerical targets based on any of these characteristics.\nCulture & Employee Engagement\nWe believe that the success of our business is tied to the quality of our workforce, and we strive to maintain a corporate environment without losing the entrepreneurial spirit with which we were founded 55 years ago. By \n13\nTable of Contents\n     \nproviding a quality workplace and comprehensive benefit programs, we recognize the commitment of our employees to bring their talent, energy and experience to us.  Our continued success will depend on our employees’ expertise and dedication.  Our workforce, as referred to in this section, excludes intern employees and union employees for which the unions control primary aspects of the hiring process.\nWe periodically conduct employee engagement surveys to monitor our employees’ satisfaction in different aspects of their employment, including company performance, leadership, communication, career development and benefits offerings.  Past employee responsiveness to the engagement surveys has been consistently high and the results help inform us on matters that our employees view as key contributors to a positive work experience.  We intend to continue to periodically evaluate employee engagement as needed on a meaningful basis. \nAnother indicator of the success of our efforts in the workplace is the long tenure of our employees. Approximately 34% of our employees have worked at BXP for ten or more years.  The average tenure of our employees is approximately 9.5 years and that of our officers is 18.4 years.  In 2024, our voluntary workforce turnover rate was 10.8%.\nCareer Development & Training \nWe invest significant resources in our employees’ personal and professional growth and development and provide a wide range of tools and development opportunities that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills.  These development opportunities include in-person and virtual training sessions, in-house learning opportunities, various management trainings, departmental conferences, executive town halls and external programs.  We foster an environment of growth and internal promotion and strive for a process that is grounded in efficiency, transparency and collaboration for our internal candidates. Open positions are posted, and employees are highly encouraged to apply for promotion within the organization.  In 2024, more than 6% of our employees were promoted to elevated roles within our organization.  \nCompensation & Benefits\nWe designed our compensation program with the goal of providing a balanced and effective way of ensuring internal equity and market competitiveness in our pay practices.  We have coupled external, market-driven data with a comprehensive performance review assessment tool to strike the balance that best represents our compensation strategy and links pay to performance.  On an annual basis, our Human Resources department evaluates market compensation ranges for each position to ensure we are appropriately compensating our employees.  We believe this total rewards program directly aligns with our compensation and benefits strategy.\nOur\n employee benefit programs are designed to meet the needs of our workforce by offering comprehensive and competitive programs to support our employees and their families.  These programs provide flexibility and choice in coverage,\n valuable resources to protect and enhance financial security, and benefits that help balance work and personal life.  Some of the benefits that we offer our employees include:\n•\nhealth (including telehealth), dental and vision insurance, \n•\nemployer-subsidized health savings account,\n•\na 401(k) plan with a generous matching contribution, \n•\nan employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to purchase our common stock at a discount, \n•\nhealth care and dependent care flexible spending accounts, \n•\nincome protection through our sick pay, salary continuation and long-term disability policies and life insurance, \n•\na scholarship program for the children of non-officer employees, \n•\ntuition reimbursement,\n•\na commuter subsidy to encourage and support the use of public transportation, \n•\npaid vacation, holiday, personal days, a volunteer day program, and paid parental leave to balance work and personal life,\n•\nwellness and mental health well-being programs,\n•\nemployee assistance program,\n14\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nmatching charitable gift program,\n•\nback-up child and elder care, and\n•\npet insurance.\nHealth, Safety & Wellness\nAs one of the largest publicly traded premier workplace REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2024) in the United States, we are keenly aware of the influence of buildings on human health and its importance to our clients and employees.  The health, safety and security of our employees, clients, contractors and other visitors to our properties are our highest priority.  We have implemented numerous operational measures to promote better health and safety in our buildings, including measures related to indoor air quality in our buildings.\nWe believe the success of our employees is dependent upon their overall well-being, including their physical health, mental health, work-life balance and financial well-being.  In addition to the benefits outlined above, we also offer our employees an Employee Wellness Program, an Employee Assistance Program and a Mental Health Well-Being Program.  The Employee Wellness Program was established in 2016 to encourage employees to improve their health and well-being by offering a variety of activities and engaging content to meet individual wellness goals.  Qualifying program participants receive a discount on a portion of their health insurance cost.  The Employee Assistance Program includes services for childcare, eldercare, personal relationship information, financial planning assistance, stress management, mental illness and general wellness and self-help.  BXP also offers a premium mental health program that provides online resources and support for employees facing a wide variety of issues.\nPolicies with Respect to Certain Activities\nThe discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies.  These policies have been determined by BXP’s Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors.\nInvestment Policies\nInvestments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate\nOur investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends/distributions to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in our value.  We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives.\nWe expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development and redevelopment projects and other acquired properties.  We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our existing markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment in select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits.  Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets.  We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of BXP’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant.  We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants.\nWe may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership.  These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio.\nEquity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments.  Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to BXP’s common stock.  Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).\n \n15\nTable of Contents\n     \nInvestments in Real Estate Mortgages and Mezzanine Debt\nWhile our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BXP, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with BXP’s qualification as a REIT.  Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment.  We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership.  As of December 31, 2024, we had one note receivable and two related party note receivables outstanding, which totaled approximately $93.7 million, after adjustments for financing costs and the current expected credit loss allowance.  \nSecurities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities\nSubject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for BXP’s REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.\nDispositions\nWe decide to dispose or partially dispose of properties based upon a periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors of BXP that doing so is in our best interests.  Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof.  Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP.  Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale.  Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain.  Generally, this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction.  Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale.  As of December 31, 2024, we had one property that was subject to a tax protection agreement, which may limit our ability to dispose of the asset or require us to pay damages to the prior owner in the event of a taxable sale in violation of the agreement.  The tax protection agreement expires on December 14, 2033, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events. \nFinancing Policies\n \nThe agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and BXP’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur.  Further, we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole.  However, our mortgages, credit facilities, joint venture agreements and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness.  In addition, we evaluate the impact of incremental leverage on our debt metrics and the credit ratings of BPLP’s publicly traded debt.  A reduction in BPLP’s credit ratings could result in us borrowing money at higher interest rates.\nThe Board of Directors of BXP will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the cost and effectiveness of entering into interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties, and us as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service.\n \nPolicies with Respect to Other Activities\nAs the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP.  BXP has issued, and may in the future issue, common or preferred units of limited partnership interest to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units.  We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BXP and BPLP does not intend to do so.  At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to enable BXP to maintain its qualification as a REIT, unless, due to changes in \n16\nTable of Contents\n     \ncircumstances or to the Code, the Board of Directors of BXP determines that it is no longer in the best interest of BXP to qualify as a REIT.  We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property.  We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act.  Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors of BXP.\n \nGovernmental Regulations\nGeneral\nCompliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material.  We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, (1) federal securities laws and regulations, (2) applicable stock exchange requirements, and (3) federal, state and local laws and regulations related to (a) our status as a REIT and other tax laws and regulations, and (b) real property, the improvements thereon and the operation thereof, such as laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, zoning, usage, building, fire and life safety codes, (4) the requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury and (5) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  In addition to the discussion below, see “\nItem 1A. – Risk Factors\n” for a discussion of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, and see “\nItem 7— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.\nEnvironmental Matters\nIt is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties.  These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect.  However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. \nFor example, in February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination.  We developed an office park on the property.  We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction.  Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions.  Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and contractual limitations, including time limits, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. \nEnvironmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties.  In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities.  In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site.  We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases.  Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable.  Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. \n17\nTable of Contents\n     \nSome of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination.  Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner.  In these situations, it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with vapor intrusion concerns and/or potential contaminant migration to or from the subject property in ground water, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures.  We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property.  For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility.  Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants.  We have developed an office park on this property.  Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization.  A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site.  The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. \nWe expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. \nCorporate Governance\nBXP is currently governed by an eleven-member Board of Directors.

A copy of each of these charters is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading “Investors” and subheading “Governance.” \n•\nThe Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, a copy of which is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading “Investors” and subheading “Governance” with the n\name “Governance Guidelines.”\n•\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which governs business decisions made and actions taken by BXP’s directors, officers and employees.  A copy of this code is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading “Investors” and subheading “Governance” with the n\name\n “Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.”  BXP intends to disclose on this website any amendment to, or waiver of, any provisions of this Code applicable to the directors and executive officers of BXP that would otherwise be required to be disclosed under the rules of the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange.  \n•\nThe Board of Directors has established an ethics reporting system that employees may use to anonymously report possible violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including concerns regarding questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, by telephone or over the internet.\n•\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a Policy on Political Spending, a copy of which is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading “Investors” and the subheading “Governance”\n with the name “Policy on Political Spending.”  The Board of Directors amended this Policy in January 2025 to provide that, beginning in fiscal year 2025, we will disclose all political spending (including amounts less then $25,000) on our website and shall make such disclosures biannually.  \nCompetition\nWe compete in the leasing of premier workplace, retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us.  In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc.\n \nPrincipal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing premier workplaces are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of client services and amenities provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of premier workplaces in the relevant market.  Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective clients, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.\n \nIn addition, we currently have \nseven\n residential properties (including one under construction) and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties.  As an owner, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators/owners whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks.  We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent.  Because the scale of our residential portfolio is relatively small, we expect to continue to retain third parties to manage our residential properties.\nOur Hotel Property\nWe operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary.  The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property.  As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property.  The hotel lease is intended to provide the economic benefits of ownership of the underlying real estate to flow to us as rental income, while our taxable REIT subsidiary earns \n19\nTable of Contents\n     \nthe profit or loss from operating the property as a hotel.  Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements.  Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary.",
  "item7": "Item 7— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.\nEnvironmental Matters\nIt is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties.  These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect.  However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. \nFor example, in February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination.  We developed an office park on the property.  We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction.  Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions.  Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and contractual limitations, including time limits, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. \nEnvironmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties.  In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities.  In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site.  We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases.  Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable.  Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. \n17\nTable of Contents\n     \nSome of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination.  Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner.  In these situations, it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with vapor intrusion concerns and/or potential contaminant migration to or from the subject property in ground water, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures.  We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property.  For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility.  Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants.  We have developed an office park on this property.  Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization.  A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site.  The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. \nWe expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. \nCorporate Governance\nBXP is currently governed by an eleven-member Board of Directors.

Throughout this section, we refer to the equity and debt securities of both BXP and BPLP as our “securities,” and the investors who own securities of BXP, BPLP or both, as our “securityholders.”  These risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur.  This section contains forward-looking statements.  You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page \n52\n.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur performance depends upon the economic conditions, particularly the supply and demand characteristics, of our markets—Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in six markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  A downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for office space and/or a reduction in rents.  Because our portfolio consists primarily of premier workplace buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for workplaces in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.  Additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries.  For example, in our Washington, DC market, we focus on leasing our properties to governmental contractors and legal firms.  In our West Coast market, our leasing is focused on clients in the technology and media industries, as well as legal firms.  In addition, in our New York market, we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms.  A reduction in spending by the Federal Government, sustained changes in space utilization due to remote work models, and/or a significant downturn in one or more of the foregoing sectors have resulted in, and could continue to result in, reduced demand for office space and adversely affect our results of operations.  \nIn addition, a significant economic downturn over a period of time could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment of a long-lived asset or an “other than temporary” impairment in the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an impairment of a long-lived asset of approximately $13.6 million and “other than temporary” impairments in the value of three of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures aggregating approximately $341.3 million.  For additional information on these impairments, see Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Any future impairments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.\nMarket and economic volatility due to adverse economic and political conditions, health crises or dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions.\n \nOur business may be adversely affected by market and economic volatility experienced by the U.S. and global economies, the real estate industry as a whole and/or the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located.  Such adverse economic and political conditions may include, among other issues, continued inflation, elevated interest rates, policy changes by the new presidential administration, prolonged labor market challenges impacting the recruitment and retention of talent, volatility in the public equity and debt markets, and international economic and other conditions, including pandemics, geopolitical instability and other conditions beyond our control.  These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and distributions as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:\n \n•\nfederal policy changes by the new presidential administration, such as the implementation of tariffs that could result in global supply chain disruptions and/or continued inflation, which could negatively impact \n20\nTable of Contents\n     \ninterest rates, potential changes to U.S. federal tax laws and budgetary changes related to government leases;\n•\nthe financial condition of our clients may be adversely affected, which may result in client defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures or for other reasons;\n•\nsignificant job losses and/or a sustained shift away from collective in-person work environments or relocations away from the markets in which we operate may occur, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces in the regions in which we operate and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;\n•\nour inability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;\n•\nreduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans;\n•\nthe value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, a dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors;\n•\none or more lenders under our line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all; and\n•\nto the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us, or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments.\nOur success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.\n \nWe depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly Owen D. Thomas, Chief Executive Officer, Douglas T. Linde, President, Raymond A. Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and Michael E. LaBelle, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer.  Among the reasons that Messrs. Thomas, Linde, Ritchey and LaBelle are important to our success is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, joint venture partners and other investors.  If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential clients and industry personnel could diminish. \n \nOur Regional Managers also have strong reputations.  Their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with clients and build-to-suit prospects.  While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective clients and industry personnel. \nRisks Related to Real Estate\nOur performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.\nOur economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected.  The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:\n•\ndownturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);\n•\nchanges in client preferences and space utilization from full-time, collective in-person work environments to hybrid or remote work models, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;\n21\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\ncompetition from other office, life sciences, hotel, retail and residential buildings;\n•\nlocal real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, life sciences, hotel, retail or residential space;\n•\nchanges in interest rates and availability of financing;\n•\nvacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;\n•\ndelays in completion of development and redevelopment projects due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages; \n•\nincreased costs to maintain, renovate and develop our properties related to inflation;\n•\nincreased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;\n•\ncivil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses or decrease the desirability to our clients in impacted locations;\n•\nsignificant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes (including reassessments and changes in tax laws), insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;\n•\ndeclines in the financial condition of our clients and our ability to collect rents from our clients; and\n•\ndecreases in the underlying value of our real estate.\nWe face potential adverse effects from major clients’ bankruptcies or insolvencies.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of a major client may adversely affect the income produced by our properties.  Our clients could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future.  We cannot evict a client solely because of its bankruptcy.  On the other hand, a bankrupt client may reject and terminate its lease with us.  In such case, our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full.  This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nOur properties face significant competition.\nWe face significant competition from developers, owners and managers of office, life sciences and residential properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our clients.  Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market.  This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain clients and may reduce the rents we are able to charge.  These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties.\nWe face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.\nWe derive most of our income from rent received from our clients. If a client experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments.  Also, when our clients decide not to renew their leases, renew for less space or terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space or there could be a substantial delay in re-letting the space.  Even if clients decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to clients, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.  As a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.\nOur actual costs to develop properties may exceed our budgeted costs.\nWe intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office, life sciences, retail and residential properties.  Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:\n \n•\nwe may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;\n22\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nwe may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to  increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, increases in interest rates, or supply chain disruptions, any of which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;\n•\nwe may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;\n•\nwe may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and, as a result, we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;\n•\nwe may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects that we do not complete;\n•\nwe may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule or at all; and\n•\nwe may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors, and this may result in the write-off of costs, payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted.\nInvestment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated.\n \nOur developed properties may be exposed to the following risks:\n•\nwe may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than projected, or at a slower pace than projected, at the time we decide to undertake the development; \n•\noperating expenses and construction costs may be greater than projected at the time of development, resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected; and\n•\noccupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.\nWe face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial and residential properties.\nWe operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other parties that are known as “mixed-use” properties.  For mixed-use developments, this means that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for residential, retail, hotel or other commercial purposes.  We are also developing, and may in the future develop, residential buildings.  We have less experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate than we do with office real estate.  As a result, if a development project includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer.  If we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate.  In addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected.  These include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing).  In the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks.  We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent.  Because we have less experience with residential properties than with office and retail properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties.  If we hire a third party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us.\n \n23\nTable of Contents\n     \nOur use of joint ventures may limit our control over and flexibility with jointly owned investments and other assets we may wish to acquire.\nIn appropriate circumstances, we intend to acquire and recapitalize or develop, as applicable, properties in joint ventures with other parties.  We currently have joint ventures that are and are not consolidated within our financial statements.  Our participation in joint ventures subjects us to risks, including but not limited to, the following risks that:\n•\nour joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property, its operation or, if applicable, the commencement of development activities, and a dispute with any of our joint venture partners could lead to the sale of a partner’s ownership interest in the venture or the property at a time or price that we do not find attractive;\n•\nsome of our joint ventures are subject to debt and, depending on credit market conditions, the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls;\n•\nour joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest, including with respect to our compliance with the REIT requirements, and our REIT status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with REIT requirements;\n•\nour joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest;\n•\nour joint venture partners may default on their obligations, which could necessitate that we fulfill their obligations ourselves;\n•\nour joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them; \n•\nour joint venture agreements may contain provisions limiting the liquidity of our interest for sale or sale of the entire asset;\n•\nas the general partner or managing member of a joint venture, we could be generally liable under applicable law for the debts and obligations of the venture, and we may not be entitled to contribution or indemnification from our partners;\n•\nour joint venture agreements may contain provisions that allow our partners to remove us as the general partner or managing member for cause, and this could result in liability for us to our partners under the governing agreement of the joint venture; and \n•\nwe may need our partner(s)’ approval to take certain actions and, therefore, we may be unable to cause a joint venture to implement decisions that we consider advisable. \nWe face the risk that third parties will not be able to service or repay loans we make to them. \nFrom time to time, we have loaned and in the future may loan funds to (1) a third-party buyer to facilitate the sale of an asset by us to such third party, or (2) a third party in connection with the formation of a joint venture to acquire and/or develop a property.  Making these loans subjects us to the following risks, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and/or financial condition:\n•\nthe third party may be unable to make full and timely payments of interest and principal on the loan when due;\n•\nif the third-party buyer to whom we provide seller financing does not manage the property well, or the property otherwise fails to meet financial projections, performs poorly or declines in value, then the buyer may not have the funds or ability to raise new debt with which to make required payments of interest and principal to us; \n•\nif we loan funds to a joint venture, and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest or principal, or both, or there are disagreements with respect to the repayment of the loan or other matters, then we could have a resulting dispute with our partner(s), and such a dispute could harm our relationship(s) with our partner(s) and cause delays in developing or selling the property or the failure to properly manage the property; and\n24\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nif we loan funds to a joint venture and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest and principal, or both, then we may exercise remedies available to us in the joint venture agreement that could allow us to increase our ownership interest or our control over major decisions, or both, which could result in an unconsolidated joint venture becoming consolidated with our financial statement; doing so could require us to reallocate the purchase price among the various asset and liability components and this could result in material changes to our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with property acquisitions.\n \nWe have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:\n \n•\neven if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;\n•\nwe may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;\n•\nacquired properties may fail to perform as expected;\n•\nthe actual costs of repositioning, redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates;\n•\nthe acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied;\n•\nacquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;\n•\nwe may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity; and\n•\nwe may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties through the acquisition of first mortgage or mezzanine debt.  Investments in these loans must be carefully structured to ensure that BXP continues to satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to REITs.  If we fail to structure any such acquisition properly, BXP could fail to qualify as a REIT.  In addition, acquisitions of first mortgage or mezzanine loans subject us to the risks associated with the borrower’s default, including potential bankruptcy, and there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosure on collateral securing or supporting these investments.  There can be no assurance that we would recover any or all of our investment in the event of such a default or bankruptcy.\n \nWe have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP.  This acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases.  These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. \nAcquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.\n \nWe may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities.  As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.  Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:\n \n25\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nliabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;\n•\nclaims by clients, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;\n•\nliabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and\n•\nclaims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.\nCompetition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.\n \nWe plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities.  We may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:\n \n•\nwe may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private REITs, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and\n•\neven if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.\nWe may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility.\n \nProperties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell.  This may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.  In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders.  These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n \nOur ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes.  Properties that we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or that we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP often have low tax bases.  Furthermore, as a REIT, BXP may be subject to a 100% “prohibited transactions” tax on the gain from dispositions of property if BXP is deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless the disposition qualifies under a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held for at least two years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met.  The potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us, or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable REIT subsidiary, which would generally result in income taxes being incurred.  If we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the  Code applicable to REITs, which in turn would impact our future cash flow and may increase our leverage.  In some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors.  To dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which are intended to qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants). \nBecause we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.\n \nThe following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property:\n \n•\nour hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners;\n•\nif there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;\n•\nour hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and\n26\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nour hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including fluctuations in consumer spending, public health concerns, war and terrorism.\nIn addition, because our hotel property is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is subject to the Cambridge market’s fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply. \nFailure to comply with Federal Government contractor requirements could result in substantial costs and loss of substantial revenue.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the U.S. Government was one of our largest clients by square feet.  We are subject to compliance with a wide variety of complex legal requirements because we are a Federal Government contractor.  These laws regulate how we conduct business, require us to administer various compliance programs and require us to impose compliance responsibilities on some of our contractors.  Our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to fines, penalties and damages, cause us to be in default of our leases and other contracts with the Federal Government and bar us from entering into future leases and other contracts with the Federal Government.  There can be no assurance that these costs and loss of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.\nChanges in rent control or rent stabilization and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio’s results of operations and residential property values.\nVarious state and local governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees, such as pet fees or application fees.  Depending on the extent and terms of future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations, as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such issues, such future enactments could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio’s results of operations and the value of our residential properties.\nState and local governments may also make changes to eviction and other tenants’ rights laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio’s results of operations and the value of our residential properties.  If we are restricted from re-leasing apartment units due to the inability to evict delinquent residents, our results of operations and property values for our residential properties may be adversely affected.\nWe did not obtain new owner’s title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during BXP’s initial public offering.\n \nWe acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of BXP’s initial public offering in June 1997.  Before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy.  We did not obtain new owner’s title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties.  To the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the initial public offering, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties.  Nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us.  Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties.  If there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of the initial public offering of BXP, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property.  We have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after the initial public offering of BXP, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. \nSome potential losses are not covered by insurance.\n \nOur property insurance program per occurrence limits are $1.0 billion for our portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism (“Terrorism Coverage”).  We also carry $1.35 billion of property insurance in excess of the $1.0 billion of coverage in our property insurance program for 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, consisting of $750 million of property and Terrorism Coverage in excess of our property insurance program and $600 million of Terrorism Coverage only in excess of the $1.75 billion of coverage.  Certain properties, including the General Motors Building located at 767 \n27\nTable of Contents\n     \nFifth Avenue in New York, New York (“767 Fifth Avenue”), are currently insured in separate insurance programs.  The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are $1.625 billion, including Terrorism Coverage.  We also currently carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, “TRIA”) (“NBCR Coverage”), which is provided by IXP, LLC (“IXP”) as a direct insurer, for the properties in our portfolio, including 767 Fifth Avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which we manage.  The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is $1.0 billion.  Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a “program trigger.”  The program trigger is $200 million, the coinsurance is 20% and the deductible is 20% of the premiums earned by the insurer for the year prior to a claim.  If the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIA.  We may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if TRIA is not extended after its expiration on December 31, 2027, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason.  We intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance.\nWe also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes.  Specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our San Francisco and Los Angeles regions with a $330 million per occurrence limit, and a $330 million annual aggregate limit, $30 million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer.  This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property.  In addition, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our Seattle region with a $110 million per occurrence limit, and a $110 million annual aggregate limit.  This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 2% of the value of the affected property.  The amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes.  In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk.  We may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of our earthquake insurance program on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage.\nIXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles properties and our NBCR Coverage.  Insofar as we own IXP, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of our consolidated financial statements.  In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government.  IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the Federal Government.  If we experience a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment.  Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.  In addition, BPLP has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of $20.0 million.\nWe continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics and cybersecurity incidents, in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.  There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost.  With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties.  Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property.  Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.\n \nWe have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  As a result, some clients in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity.  This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets \n28\nTable of Contents\n     \ngenerally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both.  In addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage.  As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially.  See also “\n—Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.\n” \nWe face risks associated with security breaches, incidents, and compromises through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems. \nWe face risks associated with security breaches, incidents, and compromises, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, social engineering tactics, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems.  The risk of a security breach, incident, compromise, or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.  Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems and accounting for our business operations) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our clients. \nAlthough we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures designed to manage the risk of a security breach, incident, compromise or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches, incident, compromise or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases, are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  \nLike other businesses, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to attempts at unauthorized access of our network, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks and intrusions and other events of varying degrees.  To date, these events have not, individually or in the aggregate, materially affected our operations or business.  However, a security breach, incident, compromise or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could: \n•\ndisrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our clients; \n•\nresult in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines and/or missed permitting deadlines; \n•\nresult in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding BXP’s qualification as a REIT; \n•\nresult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage and claims or threats by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; \n•\nresult in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our clients for the efficient use of their leased space; \n•\nrequire significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; \n•\nsubject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements or subject us to litigation and regulatory investigations and related fines and penalties; \n•\nbe uninsured or exceed policy limits, increase operating costs, including insurance expenses, or make future cyber risk coverage unavailable on commercially reasonable terms\n; \nand \n29\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\ndamage our reputation among our clients and investors generally. \nAny one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Refer to Part I, Item 1C. Cybersecurity in this Form 10-K for more information.\nThe use of technology based on artificial intelligence and machine learning presents risks and challenges that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe use artificial intelligence and machine learning technology (collectively, “AI”) capabilities with the goal of enhancing efficiencies in conducting our business.  Our deployment and application of AI remains ongoing.  While these AI tools hold promise in optimizing our work processes and driving efficiencies, they also present risks, challenges and unintended consequences that could adversely affect our business and results of operations or those of our clients.  These include, but are not limited to: \n•\nthe release, leak or disclosure of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information as a result of or in connection with our use of AI tools, \n•\nthe incorporation of AI by our clients, vendors, contractors and other third-parties into their products or services, with or without our knowledge, in a manner that could give rise to issues pertaining to data privacy, information security and intellectual property considerations, and\n•\nthe evolving legal regulations relating to AI, which may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with applicable law or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action or create additional liabilities, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time.  \nWhile we aim to use AI responsibly and securely and attempt to mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise.  There can be no assurance that we will properly implement AI, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  \nWe face risks associated with our clients and contractual counterparties being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n \nPursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”).  OFAC regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with Prohibited Persons (the “OFAC Requirements”).  Certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with OFAC Requirements.  We have established a compliance program whereby clients and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the OFAC list of Prohibited Persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter.  Our leases and other agreements, in general, require the other party to comply with OFAC Requirements.  If a client or other party with whom we contract is placed on the OFAC list we may be required by the OFAC Requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement.  Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful. \nThe outbreak of highly infectious or contagious diseases could adversely impact or cause disruption to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and that of our clients.  \nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business.  The full extent to which any future pandemic or similar outbreak may impact our operations and those of our clients will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.  Factors related to any public health crises that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition include:\n•\nchanges made by companies in response to a pandemic that could lead to a sustained shift away from collective in-person work environments or relocations away from the markets in which we operate, either of which could adversely affect the overall demand for workplaces in the regions in which we operate;\n•\nreduced economic activity and/or supply chain disruptions or delays in delivery of products, services or other materials necessary for our clients that impact our clients’ businesses, financial condition or liquidity may cause, one or more of our clients to be unable to meet their obligations to us, including their ability to make timely rental payments, in full or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such \n30\nTable of Contents\n     \nobligations, including rent concessions, deferrals or abatements, or to declare bankruptcy.  Any one or more of the foregoing could:\n•\nreduce our cash flows,\n•\nadversely impact our ability to finance, refinance or sell a property,\n•\nadversely impact our ability to continue paying distributions to our securityholders at current levels, or at all, and\n•\nresult in additional legal and other costs to enforce our rights, collect rent and/or re-lease the space occupied by the distressed client;\n•\nthe degree to which our clients’ businesses are negatively impacted could require us to write-off a client’s accrued rent balance and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity;\n•\nnew laws, governmental policies, and similar actions, including legal restrictions on prosecutions, could adversely impact public safety and thereby adversely affect (1) the desirability of clients to lease space in our properties or markets, and (2) businesses’ office re-population plans;\n•\nthe impact of a pandemic could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charge is taken;\n•\nwe may be unable to restructure or amend leases with certain of our clients on terms favorable to us or at all;\n•\nthe impact and validity of interpretations of lease provisions and applicable laws related to claims by clients regarding their obligations to pay rent as a result of a pandemic, and any adverse court rulings or decisions interpreting these provisions and laws, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity;\n•\nthe impact of governmental and business travel limitations and restrictions could result in temporary or sustained periods of decreased demand for hotel stays at our hotel property;\n•\nthe extent of labor shortages, disruptions in the supply chains, inflation impacting costs of materials, delays in permitting or inspections, and other factors could result in our failure to meet the development milestones set forth in any applicable lease agreement, which could provide the client the right to terminate its lease or entitle the client to monetary damages, delay the commencement or completion of construction and our anticipated lease-up plans for a development/redevelopment project or our overall development pipeline, including recognizing revenue for new leases, that may cause returns on investment to be less than projected, and/or increase the costs of construction of new or existing projects, any of which could adversely affect our investment returns, profitability and/or our future growth; and\n•\nthe potential that business interruption, loss of rental income and/or other associated expenses related to our operations will not be covered in whole or in part by our insurance policies, which may increase unreimbursed liabilities.\nWe face risks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change. \nThe physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business.  For example, many of our properties are located along the East and West coasts, particularly those in the central business districts of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity, extreme temperatures, rising sea-levels, extreme drought and/or wildfires.  Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or increased costs associated with infrastructure-related remediation projects.  Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by making property insurance unavailable or by increasing the cost of (i) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, (ii) real estate taxes or other assessments, (iii) energy and (iv) property maintenance.  In addition, we face transition risks related to federal, state and local legislation and regulations that are being implemented, are under consideration to \n31\nTable of Contents\n     \nmitigate the effects of climate change or that require increased environmental disclosures and reporting.  The costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements, including GHG emissions regulations and policies, could negatively impact our financial results.\nFor additional discussion regarding our approach to climate resiliency and our continued commitment to transparent reporting of sustainability performance indicators, see “\nItem 1. Business—Business and Growth Strategies—Sustainability\n” and our annual Sustainability & Impact Report available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading “Commitment.”\nPotential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.\nUnder federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at or migrating from our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate.  If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because: as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination; even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.\nThese costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property.  We currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable.  Specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a $20 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of $40 million.  The presence or migration of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may give rise to third-party claims for bodily injury, property damage and/or response costs and may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property.  In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with contamination.  Changes in laws, regulations and practices and their implementation increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures.\nEnvironmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos and other building materials.  For example, laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos: \n•\nproperly manage and maintain the asbestos;\n•\nnotify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and\n•\nundertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.\nSuch laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. \nSome of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination.  It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties.  These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling.  Where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead and other contaminants in drinking water and, for soil and/or groundwater contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem.  Even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that: \n32\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nthe environmental assessments and updates did not identify or properly address all potential environmental liabilities;\n•\na prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;\n•\nnew environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and\n•\nfuture uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.\nInquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs.  Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria.  Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other adverse health effects.  If these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may be subject to third-party claims for personal injury, or may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, special cleaning measures and steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants.  Such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property’s clients or require rehabilitation of the affected property. \nCompliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.\n \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that certain buildings, including office buildings, residential buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants.  If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.\n \nOur properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards.  We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.\n \nAny future international activities will be subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business.\n \nWe have underwritten, and in the future may acquire, properties, portfolios of properties or interests in real estate-related entities on a strategic or selective basis in international markets that are new to us.  If we acquire properties or platforms located in these markets, we will face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local laws and government and permitting procedures.  In addition, our international operations will be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international income, restrictions on the transfer of funds and uncertainty over terrorist activities.  We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur.  Further, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region.  We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise.\n \nInvestments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the U.K. Bribery Act.\n33\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe may be subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest.\n \nIf we invest in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we will be subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries.  A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations.  We may attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in which we are investing and, under certain circumstances, by hedging exchange rate fluctuations; however, access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all, in certain locations.  For leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk.  We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks.\n \nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing\nElevated interest rates have, and may continue to increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all.\n \nAs of February 21, 2025, we had $2.4 billion outstanding indebtedness, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, that bears interest at a variable rate, and we may incur more indebtedness in the future.  Approximately $0.9 billion of our variable rate debt has all been hedged with interest rates swaps to fix SOFR for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term.  Interest rates remained elevated throughout 2024 and are expected to remain elevated through 2025.  As interest rates remain high, the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt have increased, which, if current rates are sustained or continue to increase, could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders.  Further, elevated interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense.  From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors.  While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under guidance included in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging.”  In addition, high interest rates could decrease the amounts third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\n \nCovenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to modify or discontinue insurance coverage.  Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and certain secured loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain.  Our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants.  In addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources.  Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms.  Additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders’ insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.\n \nWe rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our existing portfolio, our acquisition and development activities and for working capital.  If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.  If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan.  In addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances.  Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n \n34\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.\n \nWe are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity.  Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt.  If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments come due.  In addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity.  There is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all.  These conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future.\n \nWe have had and may in the future have agreements with a number of limited partners of BPLP who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require BPLP to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property.  These tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt.  As of December 31, 2024, we had one tax protection agreement that could restrict our ability to repay or finance debt.  \nOur degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our equity and debt securities.\n \nAs of February 21, 2025, our Consolidated Debt was approximately $15.7 billion (excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt). \nThe following table presents Consolidated Market Capitalization as well as the corresponding ratios of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization (dollars and shares / units in thousands):\nFebruary 21, 2025\nShares / Units Outstanding\nCommon Stock Equivalent\nEquivalent Value (1)\nCommon Stock\n158,210 \n158,210 \n$\n10,894,341 \nCommon Operating Partnership Units\n18,529 \n18,529 \n1,275,907 \n(2)\nTotal Equity (A)\n176,739 \n$\n12,170,248 \nConsolidated Debt (B)\n$\n15,682,822 \nConsolidated Market Capitalization (A + B)\n$\n27,853,070 \nConsolidated Debt/Consolidated Market Capitalization [B / (A + B)]\n56.31 \n%\n_______________  \n(1)\nValues are based on the closing price per share of BXP’s Common Stock on February 21, 2025 of $68.86.\n(2)\nIncludes LTIP Units (including 2012 OPP Units and earned MYLTIP Units that were granted between 2013 - 2022), but excludes MYLTIP Units granted between 2023 and 2025 because the performance period for those awards has not yet ended.\nOur degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes.  Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by two major rating agencies.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these ratings.  In December 2023 and January 2024, our senior debt credit ratings were downgraded, although both remain investment grade.  In the event our senior debt is further downgraded from its current ratings, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally.  There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of BXP’s stock price, or BPLP’s ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.\n \n35\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.\n \nWe may invest cash balances in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income.  From time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):\n \n•\ndirect obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury;\n•\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies;\n•\ntaxable municipal securities;\n•\nobligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;\n•\ncommercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;\n•\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;\n•\nboth registered and unregistered money market funds; and\n•\nother highly rated short-term securities.\nInvestments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal.  Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended.  In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value.  A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. \nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nConflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in BPLP.\n \nSales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in BPLP than on BXP’s stockholders.\n \nSome holders of interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to BXP and its stockholders.  Consequently, such holders of partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt.  While BXP has exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of BXP’s Board of Directors.  While the Board of Directors has a policy with respect to these matters, directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of BXP’s stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.\nAgreement not to sell some properties.\n \nWe have had and may have in the future agreements with the contributors of properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP pursuant to which we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income to the contributors.  In addition, we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale.  In general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered. \nAlso, BPLP has had and may have in the future agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness.  These agreements may hinder actions that BPLP may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because doing so would require BPLP to make payments to the prior owners if BPLP violates these agreements. \n36\nTable of Contents\n     \nLimits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.\n \nProvisions in BXP’s charter and bylaws, BXP’s shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may:\n \n•\ndelay or prevent a change of control over BXP or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to BXP’s stockholders; and\n•\nlimit BXP’s stockholders’ opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.\nStock Ownership Limit\n \nTo facilitate maintenance of BXP’s qualification as a REIT and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of stock ownership, BXP’s charter generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of its common stock.  We refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit.”  BXP’s Board of Directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize BXP’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  In addition, under BXP’s charter, each of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and the respective families and affiliates of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of BXP’s equity common stock.  Shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties.  The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.\n \nBPLP’s Partnership Agreement\n \nBXP has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions, including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of BPLP other than BXP receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1) the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of BXP common stock in the transaction or (2) limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of BXP common stock received in the transaction.  If these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by BXP or its affiliates, consent to the transaction.  In addition, BXP has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP that it will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among others, business combinations, in which BXP receives the approval of its common stockholders unless (1) limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by BXP or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2) the limited partners of BPLP are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction.  Therefore, if BXP’s common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before it can complete the transaction:\n \n•\nholders of partnership interests in BPLP, including BXP, must vote on the matter;\n•\nBXP must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as its stockholders voted on the transaction; and\n•\nthe result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in BPLP must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved.\nWith respect to specified extraordinary transactions, BXP has agreed in BPLP’s partnership agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to structure such a transaction to avoid causing its limited partners to recognize gain for federal income tax purposes by virtue of the occurrence of or their participation in such a transaction.\nAs a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and BXP may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though BXP stockholders approve of the transaction.\n \n37\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.\n \nOur operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by BXP’s Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies.\nRisks Related to BXP’s Status as a REIT\nFailure to qualify as a REIT would cause BXP to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.\n \nIf BXP fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it will be taxed as a corporation unless certain relief provisions apply.  We believe that BXP is organized and qualified as a REIT and intends to operate in a manner that will allow BXP to continue to qualify as a REIT.  However, we cannot assure you that BXP is qualified as such, or that it will remain qualified as such in the future.  This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control.  Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.\n \nIn addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as REITs and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs.  If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then BXP may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\n \nIf BXP or any of its subsidiaries that are REITs fails to qualify as a REIT then, unless certain relief provisions apply, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:\n \n•\nBXP would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;\n•\nBXP also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for tax years ending before January 1, 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes; and\n•\nunless BXP is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, BXP could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified.\nIn addition, if BXP fails to qualify as a REIT and the relief provisions do not apply, it will no longer be required to pay dividends.  As a result of all these factors, BXP’s failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to raise capital and expand our business, and it would adversely affect the value of BXP’s common stock.  If BXP or any of its subsidiaries that are REITs fails to qualify as a REIT but is eligible for certain relief provisions, then it may retain its status as a REIT, but may be required to pay a penalty tax, which could be substantial. \nIn order to maintain BXP’s REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.\n \nIn order to maintain BXP’s REIT status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings.  To qualify as a REIT, BXP generally must distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income each year, excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments.  In addition, BXP will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of ordinary income, 95% of capital gain net income and 100% of undistributed income from prior years.  We may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments.  Any inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short- and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain BXP’s REIT status. \n38\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.\nAt any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended, including with respect to our hotel ownership structure.  We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively.  BXP, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our securityholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.\nWe face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax laws.\nBecause BXP is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes.  In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits.  Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue.  Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material.  However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.  A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.  If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income.  These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our securityholders. \nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of BXP’s common stock.\n \nAs with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of BXP’s common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time.  Among the market conditions that may affect the value of BXP’s common stock are the following:\n \n•\nthe extent of investor interest in our securities;\n•\nthe general reputation of REITs and the sentiment towards the office sector and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;\n•\nour underlying asset value;\n•\ninvestor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;\n•\nnational economic conditions;\n•\nchanges in tax laws;\n•\nour financial performance;\n•\nchanges in our credit ratings;\n•\ndifferences between the yields paid on other investments available in the market and BXP’s dividend yield; and\n•\ngeneral stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates.\nThe market value of BXP’s common stock is based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends.  Consequently, BXP’s common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than BXP’s net asset value per share of common stock.  If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of BXP’s common stock will diminish. \n39\nTable of Contents\n     \nFurther issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.\n \nThe interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions or repay indebtedness.  Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.\nThe number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of BXP’s stock.\n \nIn connection with and subsequent to BXP’s initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of stock of BXP or partnership interests in BPLP were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors.  This common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in BPLP, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors.  Additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future.  Future sales of BXP common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of its common stock.  We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of BXP’s common stock. \nOur involvement in legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial monetary and other costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and other claims.  We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our vendors, contractors, clients or other contractual parties in which such parties have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and/or added as an additional insured under certain insurance policies.  An unfavorable resolution of any legal proceeding or other claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations.  Regardless of its outcome, legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management.  With respect to any legal proceeding or other claim, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail, or achieve a favorable settlement or outcome, or that our insurance or the insurance and/or any contractual indemnities of our vendors, contractors, clients or other contractual parties will be enough to cover all of our defense costs or any resulting liabilities. \nChanges in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our clients.\n \nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.  Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements.  Changes include, but are not limited to, changes in revenue recognition, lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of “fair-value” measures.\n \nThese changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations.  In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements.  Similarly, these changes could have a material impact on our clients’ reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our clients’ preferences regarding leasing real estate.\n \nItem 1B.  \nUnresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C.  \nCybersecurity.\nOur information technology (“IT”) networks and related systems are essential to the efficient operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems and accounting for our business operations).  In some cases, our clients’ operations depend on our building systems.  The risk of a security breach, incident, compromise or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and \n40\nTable of Contents\n     \nsophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.  Like other businesses, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to attempts at unauthorized access of our network, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and intrusions and other events of varying degrees.  To date, these events have not, individually or in the aggregate, materially affected our operations or business.  \nIn addition, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our Company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n See \nItem 1A. “Risk Factors”\n for additional discussion of the cybersecurity risks related to our Company.\nCybersecurity Risk Management & Strategy\nWe have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program that is designed to identify, assess and manage risks from cybersecurity threats and was established by reference to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework.  The primary goal of our cybersecurity program is to prevent cybersecurity incidents to the extent feasible, while simultaneously increasing our system resilience in an effort to minimize the business impact should an incident occur.\n \nWe aim to take an active approach to monitoring and evaluating our cybersecurity threat environment and risk profile as part of our cybersecurity program, which is administered by our information systems (“IS”) department, led by our Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) and Senior Vice President, Chief Information Officer (“CIO,” together with our CTO, “IS Leaders”).  Our IS Leaders are primarily responsible for the direction and implementation of technology, applications and security at BXP.\n \nOur CTO has extensive technology and program management experience with approximately 40 years of technology experience, 26 years of which have been with BXP and a total of 30 years with publicly-traded REITs.  In January 2024, our IS leadership expanded to include our CIO, who has 30 years of technology experience developed across multiple industries, including commercial real estate, in guiding organizations through strategic initiatives that span technology, cybersecurity, and digital transformations.\nWe maintain written information security policies and procedures, including a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan (“CIRP”) for incidents involving potential or actual compromises of information security.  Our CIRP is overseen by the cyber executive response team, which is chaired by our Vice President, Risk Management and includes representatives from our IS and legal departments.\n \nIn the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have implemented procedures to (i) mobilize third-party subject matter experts and (ii) notify executive leadership and the Audit Committee and/or the full Board of Directors, in each case, as appropriate.\n \nAs part of our overall cybersecurity program, we also conduct:\n•\nRegular assessments of our cybersecurity program\n. We assess our cybersecurity program against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework through annual internal assessments, and, every two years, we engage a third-party consultant to conduct an additive cyber assessment.  These assessments review, among other things, our IT security measures and activities for alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.\n•\nPeriodic penetration testing & vulnerability assessments\n. On an annual basis, we engage a third-party consultant to conduct two penetration tests per year.  We also conduct vulnerability assessments on a monthly basis.\n•\nRegular cybersecurity awareness trainings & simulations\n. We conduct cybersecurity awareness training for employees and primary on-site providers during onboarding, and thereafter, multiple times per year, and we conduct regular phishing simulations in an effort to raise awareness of spoofed or manipulated electronic communications and other security threats, as well as annual tabletop simulations. \nIn addition, our internal audit function integrates the assessment and identification of cybersecurity-related risks into our annual overall enterprise risk assessment (“ERA”).  The ERA process is designed to assess and identify the key risks that management believes could adversely impact our business operations or impede the achievement of our business objectives, which includes an assessment of our cybersecurity program and the cybersecurity-related risks that we face.  \nTo the extent the ERA identifies a heightened cybersecurity-related risk(s), we have implemented a process for the risk(s) to be presented to the Audit Committee and the full Board of Directors, as appropriate.  \nWe utilize certain third-party service providers to perform select functions.  These third-party service providers also face cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting any of our third-party service providers could also indirectly affect our operations, performance and results of operations.\n \nWe have a data security committee, \n41\nTable of Contents\n     \nconsisting of members from various BXP departments, including IS, legal and risk management, that meets periodically to assess, identify and manage cybersecurity risks related to certain third-party service providers and to protect our critical financial and sensitive business information, as well as personally identifiable information (collectively, “Sensitive Information”).  The data security committee has implemented processes for evaluating the risk profile of those service providers that handle or have access to Sensitive Information, which informs applicable contractual obligations with these service providers.  This evaluation, which occurs prior to onboarding, is designed to consider the nature of the services to be provided, the level of sensitivity and quantity of the information that the service provider handles or has access to, and the identity of the service provider.\n \nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board of Directors is primarily responsible for risk oversight and discharges its responsibility directly or indirectly through its committees.  In general, our risk management is designed to be facilitated through a top-down and bottom-up communication structure whereby the Board and/or its committees provide oversight and direction, and management is charged with the day-to-day management of risks, regular assessment of the risk environment and regular reporting to the Board, which may include management reports and reports from outside advisors and consultants engaged by the Board, a specific committee or management, as appropriate.  This overall risk management and oversight framework includes risks related to cybersecurity threats.\nPursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee oversees senior management’s risk management processes related to assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks in an effort to, among other things, help align our risk exposure with our strategic objectives.\n \nThe Audit Committee meets no less frequently than annually with our IS department to discuss, among other things, recent trends in cyber risks, cybersecurity incidents, if any, and our cybersecurity defense strategy to protect against cyber-attacks and intrusions.  These discussions with the Audit Committee are led by our IS Leaders and senior management.\n  The Audit Committee provides regular updates to the full Board of Directors on matters under its purview, including risk management and cybersecurity matters.\nItem 2.\n  Properties.  \nAt December 31, 2024, we owned or had joint venture interests in 185 commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 53.3 million net rentable square feet of primarily premier workplaces, including seven properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 2.3 million net rentable square feet.

We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions, in each case, to the extent applicable.  The forward-looking statements are contained principally, but not only, under the captions\n “Business—Business and Growth Strategies,” “\nRisk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  We caution investors that forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations of future events and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management.  When used, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “should,” “will” and similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance or occurrences, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control.  If one or more of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance or occurrences and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements.  Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results, trends and assumptions at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.\nThe most significant factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include the risks and uncertainties related to adverse changes in general economic and capital market conditions, including inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, labor market disruptions, dislocation and volatility in capital markets, and potential longer-term changes in consumer and client behavior, sustained changes in client preferences and space utilization, as well as the other important factors below and the risks set forth in this Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1A.\nSome of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n•\nvolatile or adverse global economic and political conditions, health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could adversely affect economic conditions and/or restrict our access to cost-effective capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business opportunities, results of operations and financial condition;\n•\ngeneral risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases on attractive terms, changes in client preferences and space utilization, dependence on clients’ financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);\n•\nfailure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully;\n•\nthe ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations;\n•\nrisks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, construction delays, increased construction costs, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits, client accounting considerations that may result in negotiated lease provisions that limit a client’s liability during construction, and public opposition to such activities);\n•\nrisks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments or refinance existing indebtedness, including the impact of higher interest rates on the cost and/or availability of financing;\n52\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nrisks associated with forward interest rate contracts and derivatives and the effectiveness of such arrangements;\n•\nrisks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;\n•\ncosts of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws;\n•\npotential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;\n•\nrisks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change;\n•\nrisks associated with security breaches, incidents, and compromises through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems, which support our operations and our buildings; \n•\nrisks associated with legal proceedings and other claims that could result in substantial monetary damages and other costs;\n•\nrisks associated with BXP’s potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;\n•\npossible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;\n•\nthe impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results;\n•\nrisks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and\n•\nrisks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.\nThe risks set forth above are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this report, including \n“Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors,” \ninclude additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance.  Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  Investors should also refer to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and Current Reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Current Reports on Form 8-K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.  We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report.\nOverview\nBXP is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (REITs) (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2024) in the United States that develops, owns, and manages primarily premier workplaces.  Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the U.S. - Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets.  We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients.  When making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the amount of any security deposit or letter of credit posted by the client, the costs of tenant improvement allowances, free rent periods and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, the date by which we expect to begin revenue recognition for the lease under GAAP, current and anticipated vacancy in our properties and the market overall (including sublease space), current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of other clients’ expansion rights and general economic factors.\nWe believe our key competitive advantages are our commitment to the office asset class and to our clients as many competitors have divested in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital in the secured and unsecured debt markets and the private and public equity markets, and one of the highest quality portfolios of \n53\nTable of Contents\n     \npremier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional development, acquisitions and dispositions.  Clients and their advisors are increasingly focused on these attributes for their building owners, which distinguishes BXP among its competitors.\nWe consider premier workplaces to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings, are professionally managed and maintained, and offer a number and type of amenities that are in high demand by clients that are focused on the importance of the physical work environment in recruiting and retaining the best and brightest employees.  As such, these properties attract creditworthy clients and command upper-tier rental rates in their markets.  We do not consider the expression “premier workplaces” a classification of our properties in accordance with any standard listing criteria in the real estate industry.  We therefore caution investors that our use and definition of “premier workplaces” may be different than the use and definition of similar expressions and traditional classifications that may be used by other companies.\nOur core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong clients that are diverse across market sectors.  We believe this strategy provides a competitive advantage that helps BXP distinguish itself from competitors as our clients are interested in leasing space in vibrant, amenitized and accessible premier workplaces to encourage more in-person work.  This interest has accelerated the flight to quality in the office industry.  Over the past several years, BXP’s experience and performance has diverged from the larger market and media sentiment, as premier workplaces have outperformed the broader office market consistently and substantially in both rental rates achieved and occupancy.  We believe this divergence validates our strategy and differentiates BXP from other office companies.  \nPremier workplaces in our five traditional central business district (“CBD”) markets (Boston, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC) have consistently outperformed the broader office market in those CBDs on several key metrics, including occupancy, net absorption levels, rental rates and landlord concessions.  This outperformance is evident in BXP’s portfolio where we derive approximately 88% of our share of annualized rental obligations from predominantly premier workplaces located in CBDs.  We define annualized rental obligations as the monthly contractual base rent (excluding percentage rent and rent abatements) and budgeted reimbursements from clients under existing leases as of December 31, 2024, multiplied by twelve.  Our share of annualized rental obligations is calculated as the consolidated amount, plus our share of the amount from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based on our economic percentage ownership interest), less our partners’ share of the amount from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based on the partners’ economic percentage ownership interest).  As of December 31, 2024, these CBD assets are 90.9% occupied and 92.8% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)).\nAs of December 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term for (1) our in-place leases, based on square feet, including those signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding residential units, was approximately 7.8 years, and (2) our 20 largest clients, based on square feet, was approximately 9.4 years.\nOutlook\nThe important market forces impacting BXP continue to be corporate earnings growth, return-to-office behavior, limited new development starts and the outperformance of premier workplaces, all of which are currently serving as tailwinds to BXP’s performance.  Interest rates also remain a critical factor but are on a more uncertain trajectory.  Inflation rose in the last three months of 2024 to 2.9%, remaining above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and the December 2024 employment data indicated new job creation exceeded market expectations.  As a result, the Federal Reserve has become more cautious, lowering its forecast of Federal funds rate cuts in 2025.  In the fixed income markets, long-term interest rates have increased approximately 100 basis points since the Federal Reserve's first rate cut in September 2024.  Notwithstanding these uncertainties, we expect short-term interest rates to remain lower in 2025 compared to 2024, which would be a positive for both BXP and our clients' cost of capital. \nThough we are in the early stages of the new presidential administration, we believe many of the initial articulated policies are generally business friendly, particularly lower taxes and less regulation, which could build the confidence of our clients and, as a result, potentially stimulate leasing activities.\nAn area of concern with the new presidential administration's policies is the potential impact to interest rates, given that new tariffs, if implemented, could be inflationary and tax cuts without corresponding spending cuts could lead to longer fiscal deficits and higher long-term treasury yields in the debt markets.\n54\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe evolving operating environment impacts various aspects of our operating activities as:\n•\nlabor market conditions shift, which has gradually increased employer demand for mandatory in-person workdays;\n•\nprivate market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets, continues to be challenging to arrange despite broader market improvements as lenders remain focused on top-tier sponsorship and derisked financing opportunities; and\n•\nconstruction costs have increased and, although much of the cost for our active development pipeline is fixed, the cost of potential future construction activity continues to increase.\nIn light of the uncertain trajectory of the U.S. and global economies, we continue to position BXP for success by ensuring ample liquidity, managing our leverage, pursuing additional capital raising opportunities and maintaining discipline in discretionary capital expenditures, while continuing to selectively invest (including through both acquisitions and developments) in premier workplace opportunities.\n \nWe remain focused on:\n•\ncontinuing to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace segment and leveraging our strength in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share;\n•\nleasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as proactively focusing on future lease expirations;\n•\ncompleting the construction and leasing of our development properties;\n•\npursuing attractive asset class adjacencies where we have a track record of success, such as residential development;\n•\ncontinuing to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio and actively recycling capital by selling assets, subject to market conditions, that we believe no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market;\n•\nactively managing our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner; and\n•\nprioritizing risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments.\nThe following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the fourth quarter of 2024 and recent business highlights.\nLeasing Activity and Occupancy\nTo be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the client-landlord relationship.  In this regard, we believe that our competitive leasing advantage is based on the following attributes:\n•\nour understanding of our client’s short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets;\n•\nour track record of developing and operating premier workplaces in a sustainable and responsible manner; \n•\nour reputation as a high-quality developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in our markets;\n•\nour financial strength, including our ability to fund our share of lease obligations and maintain premier building standards; and\n•\nour relationships with local brokers.\nOverall, we believe that our operating environment is improving.  Although all the markets in which we operate still need consistent incremental absorption to constitute a macro recovery, we have started to see pockets of strength where low availability is driving constructive client behavior, particularly in New York and Boston which accounts for 61% of our share of annualized rental obligations.  As clients choose premier workplaces in sound financial condition, with building owners that are committed for the long term to their properties operated by the best property management teams, we expect to continue to be successful in gaining market share.  \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed 83 leases totaling more than 2.3 million square feet with a weighted-average lease term of approximately 10.3 years.  This result represents BXP’s strongest leasing quarter since the second quarter of 2019, and the amount leased is approximately 130% of our historical 10-year average for the \n55\nTable of Contents\n     \nfourth quarter.  For full year 2024, we executed 291 leases totaling approximately 5.6 million square feet with a weighted-average lease term of 9.8 years.\nAt December 31, 2024, BXP’s CBD portfolio was 90.9% occupied and 92.8% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).  Approximately 88% of our share of annualized rental obligations comes from assets located in our CBD portfolio, underscoring the strength of BXP’s strategy to invest in the highest quality buildings in dynamic urban gateway markets.\nAt December 31, 2024, the overall occupancy of our in-service office and retail properties was 87.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from September 30, 2024.  We define occupancy as space with signed leases for which revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP.  Including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced revenue recognition in accordance with GAAP, our in-service office and retail properties were approximately 89.4% leased at December 31, 2024.\nInvestment Activity\nWe remain in active pursuit of opportunities in our core markets and asset types with primarily two types of counterparties: lenders to highly leveraged assets that require recapitalization and institutional owners seeking to divest from the office asset class.  To date, there has been limited market transaction activity for higher-quality office assets, though owners are increasingly testing the market to understand pricing.  \nWe continually evaluate current and prospective markets for possible acquisitions of “value-add” assets that require lease-up or repositioning, and acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our long-term strategy of owning, managing, developing, and improving premier workplaces in each of our chosen markets.  Additional new acquisition opportunities will likely increase in this environment, and we remain committed to developing and acquiring assets to enhance our long-term growth and to meet client demand by focusing on premier workplaces.  \nConsistent with this strategy, on December 27, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 725 12th Street, an approximately 300,000 square foot, 12-story property in Washington, DC, for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $34.0 million.  We will be redeveloping the property into an approximately 320,000 square foot premier workplace.  In conjunction with the closing, we signed a lease agreement with global law firm, McDermott Will & Emery LLP, covering approximately 152,000 square feet in the top five floors of the “to-be-constructed” premier workplace.  We are currently negotiating with a client for the majority of the remaining space, although there is no guarantee we will lease such space on the terms contemplated or at all.  Ideally located in the CBD of Washington, DC, the property sits three blocks from the White House and steps from Metro Center Station, the transportation hub for the City’s Metrorail service, where the Red, Orange, Blue, and Silver lines converge.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our development/redevelopment pipeline consisted of seven properties that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 2.3 million net rentable square feet.  Our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion remains to be invested.  The commercial space in the pipeline, which excludes the residential project, was 50% pre-leased as of February 21, 2025.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed and fully placed in-service 300 Binney Street, an approximately 240,000 square foot laboratory/life sciences project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in which BXP has a 55% ownership interest.  This project is 100% leased to the Broad Institute.\nAs we continue to focus on new investments to drive future growth, we regularly review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates that either no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market.  In addition, the BXP regional teams are pursuing alternative uses for some of our suburban land holdings, which includes vacant office buildings for which the highest and best use may not be office. \nWe are currently in active negotiations for the disposition of three land sites and we expect to put an operating property into the market for sale in 2025.  If successful, these sales in aggregate could generate approximately $200.0 million of net proceeds in 2025, although it is possible that one of the land sales does not close until 2026.  However, there can be no assurance that we will complete any of these transactions on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nA brief overview of each of our markets follows.\n56\nTable of Contents\n     \nBoston\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed approximately 682,000 square feet of leases and approximately 430,000 square feet of leases commenced in the Boston region.  Approximately 146,000 square feet of the leases that commenced had been vacant for less than one year and represent a decrease in net rental obligations of approximately 0.3% over the prior leases.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, our approximately 8.4 million square foot Boston CBD in-service portfolio was approximately 95.6% occupied and approximately 97.5% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).\nOur approximately 2.7 million square foot in-service CBD portfolio in Cambridge was approximately 96.6% occupied and 97.6% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP) as of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our approximately 4.8 millions square foot Route 128-Mass Turnpike in-service portfolio was approximately 75.6% occupied and approximately 77.7% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).\nLos Angeles\nOur Los Angeles (“LA”) in-service portfolio of approximately 2.3 million square feet is currently focused in West LA and includes Colorado Center, an approximately 1.1 million square foot property of which we own 50%, and Santa Monica Business Park, a 21-building, approximately 1.2 million square foot property.  As of December 31, 2024, our LA in-service properties were approximately 84.9% occupied and 87.4% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).   \nNew York\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed approximately 574,000 square feet of leases in the New York region and approximately 575,000 square feet of leases commenced.  Approximately 199,000 square feet of the leases that commenced had been vacant for less than one year, and they represent a decrease in net rental obligations of approximately 5.9% over the prior leases.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, our New York CBD in-service portfolio was approximately 90.8% occupied and approximately 93.6% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).   \nSan Francisco\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed leases for approximately 383,000 square feet and approximately 106,000 square feet commenced in the San Francisco region.  Approximately 56,000 square feet of leases that commenced had been vacant for less than one year and represent an increase in net rental obligations of approximately 13.2% over the prior leases.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our San Francisco CBD in-service properties were approximately 84.3% occupied and approximately 85.2% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).  \nSeattle\nOur Seattle in-service portfolio includes Safeco Plaza, an approximately 762,000 square foot property of which we own 33.67%, and Madison Centre, an approximately 755,000 square foot property.  As of December 31, 2024, these in-service properties were approximately 81.6% occupied and approximately 83.5% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).  \nWashington, DC \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed leases for approximately 494,000 square feet and leases for approximately 140,000 square feet commenced in the Washington, DC region.  Leases for approximately 64,000 square feet that commenced had been vacant for less than one year and represent a decrease in net rental obligations of approximately 11.6% over the prior leases.  \n57\nTable of Contents\n     \nAs of December 31, 2024, our Washington, DC CBD in-service properties were approximately 89.2% occupied and approximately 90.7% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP). \nA significant component of our Washington, DC regional portfolio is in Reston Town Center, an award-winning mixed-use development in Northern Virginia.  Reston is a hub for technology, cloud services, cybersecurity and defense intelligence companies.  As of December 31, 2024, our approximately 4.9 million square foot Reston CBD portfolio was approximately 94.9% occupied and approximately 96.9% leased (including vacant space for which have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).\nIn regard to the new presidential administration’s efficiency initiatives, if the federal workforce returns to their offices, their return should be a significant positive for our business in the Washington, DC region.  More street life would be a positive for the urban environment, hopefully triggering government contractor clients to return to their offices in line with government clients.  In addition, if the General Services Administration (“GSA”) reduces space requirements, we do not expect to be directly or materially impacted by this reduction as we have limited exposure to GSA leases. \nLeasing Statistics\nThe table below details our vacancy and the leasing activity, including 100% of the unconsolidated joint ventures, that commenced revenue recognition during the year ended December 31, 2024:\nYear ended December 31, 2024\n(Square Feet)\nVacant space available at the beginning of the period\n5,696,007 \nVacant space from property dispositions/properties taken out of service (1)\n(580,232)\nVacant space from properties placed (and partially placed) in-service (2)\n831,121 \nLeases expiring or terminated during the period\n4,952,232 \nTotal space available for lease\n10,899,128 \n1\nst\n generation leases \n754,932 \n2\nnd\n generation leases with new clients\n1,965,698 \n2\nnd\n generation lease renewals\n2,056,424 \nTotal space leased (3)\n4,777,054 \nVacant space available for lease at the end of the period\n6,122,074 \nLeases executed during the period (4)\n5,648,615 \nSecond generation leasing information\n: (5)\nLeases commencing during the period, in square feet\n4,022,122 \nWeighted Average Lease Term\n89 Months\nWeighted Average Free Rent Period\n140 Days\nTotal Transaction Costs Per Square Foot (6)\n$79.32 \nIncrease in Gross Rents (7)\n1.38 \n%\nIncrease in Net Rents (8)\n1.79 \n%\n \n__________________\n(1)\nTotal square feet from properties taken out of service during the year ended December 31, 2024 consists of 205,355 square feet at 1100 Winter Street, 162,274 square feet at 1050 Winter Street, 111,183 square feet at Kingstowne One, 71,420 square feet at 15825 Shady Grove Road and 30,000 square feet at 17 Hartwell Avenue.                  \n(2)\nTotal square feet from properties placed (and partially placed) in-service during the year ended December 31, 2024 consists of 239,908 square feet at 300 Binney Street, 187,048 square feet at 180 CityPoint, 117,907 square feet at 760 Boylston Street, 112,841 square feet at 103 CityPoint, 102,542 square feet at 360 Park Avenue South, 67,017 square feet at 651 Gateway and 3,858 square feet at Reston Next Office Phase II\n.\n58\nTable of Contents\n     \n(3)\nRepresents leases for which lease revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP during the year ended December 31, 2024\n.\n(4)\nRepresents leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2024 for which we either (1) commenced lease revenue recognition in such period or (2) will commence lease revenue recognition in subsequent periods, in accordance with GAAP, and includes leases at properties currently under development.

Business—Transactions During 2024\n.”\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements.  From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.  In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.  Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following:\n•\nPurchase price allocations,\n•\nImpairment and\n•\nImpairment related to unconsolidated joint ventures.\nEach of the above critical accounting estimates is described in more detail below.  \nReal Estate\nPurchase Price Allocations\nWe assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, “above-” and “below-market” leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant.  We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.\n59\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.  We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the clients, the clients’ credit quality and expectations of lease renewals.  Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.\nWe record acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.  Acquired “above-” and “below-market” lease values have been reflected within Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each client’s lease.  Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases.  In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions.  In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we completed two acquisitions in Washington, DC consisting of (1) 725 12th Street for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $34.0 million and (2) our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture entity that owned 901 New York Avenue.  At acquisition, the total net equity acquired for 901 New York Avenue was $20.0 million, which includes $10.0 million in cash that we paid for the joint venture partner's 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture.  These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nImpairment\nManagement reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates.  Any or all of such assumptions could differ materially from actual results in future periods.  Because cash flows on properties considered to be “long-lived assets to be held and used” are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset may be impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss.  If our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate a shorter hold period, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material.  If we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.  At March 31, 2024, we evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of our Shady Grove property, consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel, located in Rockville, Maryland.  Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that we anticipate selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024.  As a result, each of BXP and BPLP recognized an impairment loss of approximately $13.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nUnconsolidated\n \nJoint Ventures\nImpairment\nOur investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary.  This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions.  We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding \n60\nTable of Contents\n     \nfuture occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, debt interest rates and availability, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the net carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately $1.1 billion, which includes investments with deficit balances aggregating approximately $33.5 million included within Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments in Colorado Center, Gateway Commons and Safeco Plaza of approximately $168.4 million, $126.1 million and $46.8 million, respectively (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIncome Taxes \nOur accounting policies related to income tax are described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBXP\nThe net difference between the tax basis and the reported amounts of BXP’s assets and liabilities was approximately $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was primarily related to the difference in basis of contributed property and accrued rental income.\nCertain entities included in BXP’s Consolidated Financial Statements are subject to certain state and local taxes.

As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period.  Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results.  Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the “Same Property Portfolio”) and the changes attributable to the properties included in the Acquired, Placed In-Service, In or Held for Development or Redevelopment or Sold Portfolios.\nIn our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of NOI between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented.  We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio.  The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in or held for development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.\n64\nTable of Contents\n     \nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as applicable, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, plus (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, impairment loss, losses from interest rate contracts, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) unrealized gain on non-real estate investments, gains from investments in securities, interest and other income (loss), gains on sales of real estate, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue.  We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership.  For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level.  Similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity).  In addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level.  NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define NOI differently.  \nWe believe that in order to understand our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to BXP, Inc. or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nDepreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of BPLP (“OP Units”).  This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties.  The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense when those properties are sold.  For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023 \nThe table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio.  The Same Property Portfolio consists of 127 properties totaling approximately 40.3 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures.  The Same Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2023 and owned and in service through December 31, 2024.  The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment after January 1, 2023 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2024.  This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment or sold.  We did not sell any properties during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n65\nTable of Contents\n     \n \nSame Property Portfolio\nProperties Acquired Portfolio\nProperties\nPlaced In-Service\nPortfolio\nProperties in or Held for Development or Redevelopment Portfolio\nTotal Property Portfolio\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n%\nChange\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n%\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\nRental Revenue: (1)\nLease Revenue (Excluding Termination Income)\n$\n2,934,261 \n$\n2,955,816 \n$\n(21,555)\n(0.73)\n%\n$\n100,007 \n$\n3,603 \n$\n71,302 \n$\n24,442 \n$\n7,540 \n$\n11,906 \n$\n3,113,110 \n$\n2,995,767 \n$\n117,343 \n3.92 \n%\nTermination Income\n9,275 \n13,082 \n(3,807)\n(29.10)\n%\n189 \n— \n— \n— \n6,409 \n— \n15,873 \n13,082 \n2,791 \n21.33 \n%\nLease Revenue\n2,943,536 \n2,968,898 \n(25,362)\n(0.85)\n%\n100,196 \n3,603 \n71,302 \n24,442 \n13,949 \n11,906 \n3,128,983 \n3,008,849 \n120,134 \n3.99 \n%\nParking and Other\n123,271 \n109,660 \n13,611 \n12.41 \n%\n8,252 \n287 \n1,815 \n1,201 \n118 \n2 \n133,456 \n111,150 \n22,306 \n20.07 \n%\nTotal Rental Revenue (1)\n3,066,807 \n3,078,558 \n(11,751)\n(0.38)\n%\n108,448 \n3,890 \n73,117 \n25,643 \n14,067 \n11,908 \n3,262,439 \n3,119,999 \n142,440 \n4.57 \n%\nReal Estate Operating Expenses\n1,190,288 \n1,134,568 \n55,720 \n4.91 \n%\n39,885 \n1,431 \n22,744 \n10,802 \n10,449 \n13,896 \n1,263,366 \n1,160,697 \n102,669 \n8.85 \n%\nNet Operating Income (Loss), Excluding Residential and Hotel \n1,876,519 \n1,943,990 \n(67,471)\n(3.47)\n%\n68,563 \n2,459 \n50,373 \n14,841 \n3,618 \n(1,988)\n1,999,073 \n1,959,302 \n39,771 \n2.03 \n%\nResidential Net Operating Income (2)\n26,036 \n24,342 \n1,694 \n6.96 \n%\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n26,036 \n24,342 \n1,694 \n6.96 \n%\nHotel Net Operating Income (2)\n15,936 \n15,132 \n804 \n5.31 \n%\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n15,936 \n15,132 \n804 \n5.31 \n%\nNet Operating Income (Loss)\n$\n1,918,491 \n$\n1,983,464 \n$\n(64,973)\n(3.28)\n%\n$\n68,563 \n$\n2,459 \n$\n50,373 \n$\n14,841 \n$\n3,618 \n$\n(1,988)\n$\n2,041,045 \n$\n1,998,776 \n$\n42,269 \n2.11 \n%\n_______________\n(1)\nRental Revenue is equal to Revenue less Development and Management Services Revenue and Direct Reimbursements of Payroll and Related Costs from Management Services Revenue per the Consolidated Statements of Operations, excluding the residential and hotel revenue that is noted below.

Residential Net Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is comprised of Residential Revenue of $49,508 and $47,592 less Residential Expenses of $23,472 and $23,250, respectively.  Hotel Net Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $51,224 and $47,357 less Hotel Expenses of $35,288 and $32,225, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n66\nTable of Contents\n     \nSame Property Portfolio\nLease Revenue (Excluding Termination Income)\nLease revenue (excluding termination income) from the Same Property Portfolio decreased by approximately $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  The decrease was a result of our average occupancy decreasing from 90.8% to 88.9%, resulting in a decrease of approximately $60.6 million, partially offset by revenue per square foot increasing by approximately $1.14, contributing approximately $39.0 million.\nTermination Income\nTermination income decreased by approximately $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.\nTermination income for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to 30 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $9.3 million, with the largest contribution related to a retail client that terminated its lease early in Boston.\nTermination income for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to 28 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $13.1 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in Seattle.\nParking and Other Revenue\nParking and other revenue increased by approximately $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  Parking and other revenue increased by approximately $1.8 million and $11.8 million, respectively.  The increase in other revenue was primarily related to the View Boston observatory.\nReal Estate Operating Expenses\nReal estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately $55.7 million, or 4.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to increases in (1) repairs and maintenance of approximately $18.3 million, or 9.9%, (2) utilities of approximately $11.0 million, or 9.8%, and (3) other real estate operating expenses of approximately $16.0 million, or 1.9%.  The increase in repairs and maintenance related primarily to properties in our Boston region.  The increase in utilities related primarily to properties in our New York region.  In addition, approximately $10.4 million of the increase related to marketing and operating expenses associated with the View Boston observatory.\nProperties Acquired Portfolio\nThe table below lists the properties acquired between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2024.

Although no longer in redevelopment, this property is not considered “in-service” as we are not actively leasing this property in anticipation of restarting redevelopment in the future. \n(2)\nThe Kendall Center Blue Parking Garage was taken out of service on January 4, 2023 and then demolished to support the development of 290 Binney Street. Real estate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included approximately $2.4 million of demolition costs. \n(3)\nLexington Office Park, 1050 and 1100 Winter Street, 17 Hartwell Avenue, Kingstowne One and a portion of Shady Grove Innovation District are no longer considered “in-service” because each property’s occupied percentage is less than 50% and we are no longer actively leasing the properties in anticipation of a future development/redevelopment. The properties will be considered held for development or redevelopment until the last client has vacated the property and the \n68\nTable of Contents\n     \nproperty is no longer revenue producing.  Shady Grove Innovation District is comprised of three buildings, 2092 and 2098 Gaither Road and 15825 Shady Grove Road that were taken out of service between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2024. \n(4)\n1100 Winter Street was taken out of service as of September 30, 2024.  Rental revenue at 1100 Winter Street for the year ended December 31, 2024 included approximately $6.4 million of termination income.\nResidential Net Operating Income\nNet operating income for our residential same properties increased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  \nThe following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our residential same properties for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nAverage Monthly Rental Rate (1)\nAverage Rental Rate Per Occupied Square Foot\nAverage Physical Occupancy (2)\nAverage Economic Occupancy (3)\nName\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\nProto Kendall Square\n$\n3,209 \n$\n3,076 \n4.3 \n%\n$\n5.90 \n$\n5.65 \n4.4 \n%\n94.9 \n%\n95.5 \n%\n(0.6)\n%\n94.8 \n%\n95.1 \n%\n(0.3)\n%\nThe Lofts at Atlantic Wharf\n$\n4,420 \n$\n4,432 \n(0.3)\n%\n$\n4.94 \n$\n4.91 \n0.6 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n— \n%\n94.5 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n(1.2)\n%\nSignature at Reston\n$\n2,841 \n$\n2,698 \n5.3 \n%\n$\n2.92 \n$\n2.79 \n4.7 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n94.9 \n%\n0.7 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n94.3 \n%\n1.4 \n%\nThe Skylyne\n$\n3,387 \n$\n3,480 \n(2.7)\n%\n$\n4.28 \n$\n4.42 \n(3.2)\n%\n89.0 \n%\n91.1 \n%\n(2.3)\n%\n87.1 \n%\n89.1 \n%\n(2.2)\n%\n_____________  \n(1)\nAverage Monthly Rental Rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (A) rental revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, by (B) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period. \n(2)\nAverage Physical Occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.\n(3)\nAverage Economic Occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage.  Total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at Market Rents.  Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents.  By measuring vacant units at their Market Rents, Average Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property’s total possible gross revenue.  Market Rents used by us in calculating Economic Occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property’s units and publicly available market data. Actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from Market Rents used by us.  Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions. \nHotel Net Operating Income \nThe Boston Marriott Cambridge hotel had net operating income of approximately $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of approximately $0.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the Boston Marriott Cambridge hotel for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\nOccupancy\n77.2 \n%\n72.8 \n%\n6.0 \n%\nAverage daily rate\n$\n331.41 \n$\n326.18 \n1.6 \n%\nREVPAR\n$\n255.73 \n$\n237.44 \n7.7 \n%\nOther Operating Revenue and Expense Items\nDevelopment and Management Services Revenue\nDevelopment and management services revenue decreased by approximately $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  Development services revenue and management services revenue decreased by approximately $6.1 million and $6.7 million, respectively.  The decrease in development services \n69\nTable of Contents\n     \nrevenue is primarily related to decreases in fees associated with tenant improvement projects in New York City and decreases in development income earned from unconsolidated joint ventures in the San Francisco and Washington DC regions. The decrease in management services revenue primarily related to the elimination of property and asset management fees earned from an unconsolidated joint venture in the Los Angeles region in which we acquired the joint venture partner’s interest in December 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased by approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to decreases in compensation expense and other general and administrative expenses of approximately $10.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.  The decrease in compensation expense related to an approximately $8.9 million decrease in other compensation expenses and approximately $1.2 million decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan.\nWages directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term.  Capitalized wages for each of the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $17.2 million and $16.1 million, respectively.  These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs decreased by approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  In general, transaction costs relate to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred. \nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP.  This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties.  The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense.  For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    \nBXP\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as detailed below.\nPortfolio\nDepreciation and Amortization for the year ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(in thousands)\nSame Property Portfolio \n$\n800,814 \n$\n797,908 \n$\n2,906 \nProperties Acquired Portfolio\n55,236 \n2,112 \n53,124 \nProperties Placed In-Service Portfolio \n25,657 \n24,333 \n1,324 \nProperties in or Held for Development or Redevelopment Portfolio (1)\n5,484 \n6,460 \n(976)\n$\n887,191 \n$\n830,813 \n$\n56,378 \n_____________\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Kendall Center Blue Parking Garage was taken out of service and demolished to support the development of 290 Binney Street, an approximately 573,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded approximately $0.8 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the demolition of the garage, of which approximately $0.2 million related to the step-up of real estate assets.\n70\nTable of Contents\n     \nBPLP\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as detailed below.\nPortfolio\nDepreciation and Amortization for the year ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(in thousands)\nSame Property Portfolio \n$\n794,006 \n$\n791,080 \n$\n2,926 \nProperties Acquired Portfolio\n55,236 \n2,112 \n53,124 \nProperties Placed In-Service Portfolio\n25,657 \n24,333 \n1,324 \nProperties in or Held for Development or Redevelopment Portfolio (1)\n5,484 \n6,280 \n(796)\n$\n880,383 \n$\n823,805 \n$\n56,578 \n_____________\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Kendall Center Blue Parking Garage was taken out of service and demolished to support the development of 290 Binney Street, an approximately 573,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, BPLP recorded approximately $0.6 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the demolition of the garage.\nDirect Reimbursements of Payroll and Related Costs From Management Services Contracts and Payroll and Related Costs From Management Service Contracts\nWe have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements.  We anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other.\nOther Income and Expense Items\nLoss from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $103.6 million primarily due to the recognition of non-cash impairment charges related to our investments in Colorado Center, Gateway Commons and Safeco Plaza aggregating approximately $341.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the recognition of non-cash impairment charges in the amount of $272.6 million related to our investments in Platform 16, 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue and Safeco Plaza during the year ended December 31, 2023.  \nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2024, there was an approximately $21.8 million gain recognized from acquiring our joint venture partner’s economic ownership interest in 901 New York Avenue. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, there was an approximately $34.3 million net gain related to the disposition of our ownership interest in Metropolitan Square and an approximately $29.9 million net gain related to the acquisition of our joint venture partner’s ownership interest in Santa Monica Business Park that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nGains on Sales of Real Estate\nThe $0.6 million and $0.5 million gains on sale of real estate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were related to the sale of real estate occurring in prior periods.  \nGains on sales of real estate may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP.  This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties.  The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold.  For additional information, see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \n71\nTable of Contents\n     \nInterest and Other Income (Loss)\nInterest and other income (loss) decreased by approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to a decrease in our outstanding cash balances and corresponding lower interest income.\nGains from Investments in Securities\nGains from investments in securities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for BXP’s officers and former non-employee directors.  Under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer’s current income or the non-employee director’s compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director.  In order to reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director.  This enables us to generally match our liabilities to BXP’s officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk.  The performance of these investments is recorded as gains from investments in securities.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of approximately $4.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively, on these investments.  By comparison, our general and administrative expense decreased by approximately $4.4 million and $5.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of decreases in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of BXP participating in the plans.\nUnrealized Gain on Non-Real Estate Investments\nWe invest in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally-focused investment funds.  As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain of approximately $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments.\nImpairment Loss\nAt March 31, 2024, we evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of our Shady Grove property, located in Rockville, Maryland, consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel.  Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that we anticipate selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024.  As a result, each of BXP and BPLP recognized an impairment loss of approximately $13.6 million.  Our estimated fair value was based on Level 3 inputs as defined in ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” and on a pending offer from a third party (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nLosses from Interest Rate Contracts\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, we entered into two agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a $600.0 million interest rate cap.  We did not elect hedge accounting, and as such, any change in market value will be recognized at the end of the period.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a loss of approximately $79,000 from entering into these agreements.  We did not recognize any losses during the year ended December 31, 2024.  \n72\nTable of Contents\n     \nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as detailed below.\nComponent\nChange in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023\n \n(in thousands)\nIncreases to interest expense due to:\nNew mortgage loan financings (1)\n$\n64,308 \nUnsecured commercial paper (2)\n18,582 \nIssuance of $750 million in aggregate principal of 6.500% senior notes due 2034 on May 15, 2023\n18,345 \nIssuance of $850 million in aggregate principal of 5.750% senior notes due 2035 on August 26, 2024\n16,979 \nOther interest expense (excluding senior notes)\n105 \nTotal increases to interest expense\n118,319 \nDecreases to interest expense due to:\nRepayment of $700 million in aggregate principal of 3.800% senior notes due 2024 on February 1, 2024\n(24,600)\nDecrease in interest associated with unsecured term loans and the unsecured credit facility, net (3)\n(13,430)\nRepayment of $500 million in aggregate principal of 3.125% senior notes due 2023 on September 1, 2023\n(10,672)\nDecrease in interest due to finance leases\n(2,109)\nIncrease in capitalized interest related to development projects\n(1,724)\nAmortization expense of financing fees \n(239)\nTotal decreases to interest expense\n(52,774)\nTotal change in interest expense\n$\n65,545 \n______________\n(1)\nConsists of the mortgage loan and, if applicable, fair value debt and swap adjustments collateralized by (1) 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Cambridge East Garage (also known as Kendall Center Green Garage) properties located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, (2) Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California \nand (3) 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC\n (See Notes \n7 and \n8\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(2)\nOn April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program (See Note \n7\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(3)\nIncludes, if applicable, swap adjustments (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nInterest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term.  As portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed.  Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $42.0 million and $42.6 million, respectively.  These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.  The decrease in capitalized interest is primarily attributable to a development project that had a finance lease and is now placed in service.\nOn January 15, 2025, we repaid at maturity $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.200% unsecured senior notes.  The repayment was completed with available cash and proceeds from our August 2024 offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035.\nAt December 31, 2024, our variable rate debt consisted of (1) BPLP’s $2.0 billion 2021 Credit Facility, (2) BPLP’s $700.0 million 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and (3) BPLP’s $500.0 million unsecured commercial paper notes.  As of December 31, 2024, the 2021 Credit Facility did not have a balance outstanding.  In addition, we have the $100.0 million 2024 Unsecured Term Loan and $800.0 million of mortgage notes collateralized by Santa Monica Business Park and our 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Cambridge East Garage (also known \n73\nTable of Contents\n     \nas Kendall Center Green Garage) properties that bore interest at variable rates, which have all been hedged with interest rates swaps to fix SOFR for all or a portion of the applicable debt term.

Due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on BPLP’s financial statements.   \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nGeneral\nOur principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:\n•\nfund normal recurring expenses;\n•\nmeet debt service and principal repayment obligations and balloon payments on maturing debt, including:\n•\n$700.0 million of principal outstanding on the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan due May 16, 2025,\n•\n$100.0 million of principal outstanding on the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan due September 26, 2025, for which we have three, one-year extension options, subject to customary conditions,\n•\n$1.0 billion of 3.650% unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2026, and\n•\namounts that become due under BPLP’s unsecured commercial paper program\n•\nfund capital calls from our unconsolidated joint venture investments to fund development costs, capital improvements, leasing costs and debt principal repayment;\n•\nfund development and redevelopment costs;\n74\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nfund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;\n•\nfund possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests; and\n•\nmake the minimum distribution required to enable BXP to maintain its REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nWe expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:\n•\ncash flow from operations;\n•\ndistribution of cash flows from joint ventures;\n•\ncash and cash equivalent balances;\n•\nborrowings under BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction loans;\n•\nlong-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); \n•\nsales of real estate and interests in joint ventures owning real estate; \n•\nprivate equity sources, including institutional investors; and\n•\nissuances of BXP equity securities and/or preferred or common units of partnership interests in BPLP.\nWe draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs.  We expect to fund our current development/redevelopment projects primarily with our available cash balances, funding from institutional private equity partners, construction loans, unsecured term loans, proceeds from possible asset sales, BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility and BPLP's commercial paper program.  We use BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness, fund short-term development costs and for working capital.  We also use BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility to backstop BPLP’s commercial paper program.  Although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by BPLP, the source of financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project’s size and duration, whether the project is owned by a joint venture, the extent of pre-leasing, our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.\n75\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe following table presents information on properties under construction/redevelopment as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nFinancings\nConstruction/Redevelopment Properties\nEstimated Stabilization Date\nLocation\n# of Buildings\nEstimated Square Feet\nInvestment to Date (1)(2)(3)\nEstimated Total Investment (1)(2)\nTotal Available (1)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2024 \n(1)\nEstimated Future Equity Requirement (1)(2)(4)\nPercentage Leased (5)\nOffice\n360 Park Avenue South (71% ownership) (Redevelopment)\nQ4 2026\nNew York, NY\n1\n450,000 \n$\n359,688 \n$\n418,300 \n$\n156,470 \n$\n156,470 \n$\n58,612 \n23 \n%\n(6)\nReston Next Office Phase II\nQ2 2026\nReston, VA\n1\n90,000 \n45,672 \n61,000 \n— \n— \n15,328 \n9 \n%\n(7)\n725 12th Street (Redevelopment)\nQ4 2030\nWashington, DC\n1\n320,000 \n51,447 \n349,600 \n— \n— \n298,153 \n47 \n%\n(8)\nTotal Office Properties under Construction/Redevelopment\n3\n860,000 \n456,807 \n828,900 \n156,470 \n156,470 \n372,093 \n30 \n%\nLaboratory/Life Sciences \n651 Gateway (50% ownership) (Redevelopment)\nQ3 2026\nSouth San Francisco, CA\n1\n327,000 \n132,083 \n167,100 \n— \n— \n35,017 \n21 \n%\n(9)\n290 Binney Street (55% ownership)\nQ2 2026\nCambridge, MA\n1\n573,000 \n212,002 \n508,000 \n— \n— \n295,998 \n100 \n%\n(10)\nTotal Laboratory/Life Sciences Properties under Construction/Redevelopment\n2\n900,000 \n344,085 \n675,100 \n— \n— \n331,015 \n71 \n%\nResidential\n121 Broadway Street (439 units)\nQ2 2029\nCambridge, MA\n1\n492,000 \n104,364 \n597,800 \n— \n— \n493,436 \n— \n%\nTotal Residential Property under Construction\n1\n492,000 \n104,364 \n597,800 \n— \n— \n493,436 \n— \n%\nRetail\nReston Next Retail\nQ4 2025\nReston, VA\n1\n33,000 \n24,427 \n26,600 \n— \n— \n2,173 \n13 \n%\nTotal Retail Properties under Construction\n1\n33,000 \n24,427 \n26,600 \n— \n— \n2,173 \n13 \n%\nTotal Properties under Construction/Redevelopment\n7\n2,285,000 \n$\n929,683 \n$\n2,128,400 \n$\n156,470 \n$\n156,470 \n$\n1,198,717 \n50 \n%\n(11)\n___________  \n(1)\nRepresents our share.  \n(2)\nEach of Investment to Date, Estimated Total Investment and Estimated Future Equity Requirement represent our share of acquisition expenses, as applicable, and reflect our share of the estimated net revenue/expenses that we expect to incur prior to stabilization of the project, including any amounts actually received or paid through December 31, 2024. \n(3)\nIncludes approximately $44.0 million of unpaid but accrued construction costs and leasing commissions.\n(4)\nExcludes approximately $44.0 million of unpaid but accrued construction costs and leasing commissions.\n(5)\nRepresents percentage leased as of February 21, 2025, including leases with future commencement dates.\n(6)\nAs of December 31, 2024, this property was 30% placed in-service.\n(7)\nAs of December 31, 2024, this property was 6% placed in-service.\n(8)\nWe acquired 725 12th Street on December 27, 2024 for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $34.0 million. Concurrently with the acquisition, a lease was executed with McDermott Will & Emery LLP for approximately 152,000 square feet of the redeveloped building (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(9)\nAs of December 31, 2024, this property was 27% placed in-service.  This property was fully placed in-service on January 2, 2025 (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(10)\nOn March 21, 2024, we completed the sale of a 45% interest in 290 Binney Street (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The project budget reflects our 55% share of joint venture costs related to 290 Binney Street.  We have the sole obligation to construct an underground electrical vault for an estimated gross cost of $183.9 million.  We have entered into a contract to sell the electrical vault to a third party for a fixed price of $84.1 million upon completion.  The net investment of $99.8 million will be included in our outside basis in 290 Binney Street.  We have invested $71.9 million for the vault as of December 31, 2024.\n(11)\nPercentage leased excludes the residential property.\n76\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing client turnover and controlling operating expenses.  Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses, interest earned on cash deposits and, from time to time, the sale of assets.  We believe these sources of capital will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs.  Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows and our ability to repay or refinance existing indebtedness as it matures.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had seven properties under development or redevelopment.  BXP’s Share of the estimated total investment for these projects is approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion remains to be funded through 2030.  \nSince the third quarter of 2024, we further strengthened our balance sheet by repaying debt and extending maturities.\n \nNotable transactions include:\n•\nOn October 8, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan collateralized by our Santa Monica Business Park properties located in Santa Monica, California (“SMBP Loan”).  The SMBP Loan had an outstanding principal balance of $200.0 million, bore interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 19, 2025.  The modified loan has an outstanding principal balance of $200.0 million, is scheduled to mature on October 8, 2028 and continues to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum until July 19, 2025.  Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.60% per annum through the maturity date.  The entire principal is subject to interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 2.675% per annum through April 1, 2025 (See Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  \n•\nOn January 15, 2025, we repaid at maturity $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.200% unsecured senior notes.  The repayment was completed with available cash and proceeds from our August 2024 offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt maturing through February 2026 was approximately $551.4 million.  This debt matures at different times through February 2026 and we expect to fund the repayment of this debt through a combination of refinancings in whole or in part, available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, draws on BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility, proceeds from BPLP’s unsecured commercial paper program, secured debt or unsecured debt.  \nWe expect net interest expense will be higher in 2025 as a result of lower projected interest income in 2025 due to (i) lower cash balances as a result of ongoing development costs in 2025 and (ii) the repayment of our $850.0 million unsecured senior notes at maturity on January 15, 2025 (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  We expect our interest expense will be flat or slightly higher in 2025 compared to 2024 (assuming no interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve) primarily due to the increased interest expense associated with BPLP’s August 2024 issuance of $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes offset by lower average outstanding debt balances.    \nAs of February 21, 2025, we had available cash of approximately $366.7 million (of which approximately $125.0 million was attributable to our consolidated joint venture partners).  Our liquidity and capital resources depend on a wide range of factors, and we believe that our access to capital and our strong liquidity, including the approximately $1.2 billion available under BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility and our available cash, as of February 21, 2025, are sufficient to fund our remaining capital needs on existing development and redevelopment projects, fund acquisitions, repay our maturing indebtedness when due (if not refinanced or extended), satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and still allow us to act opportunistically on attractive investment opportunities.  We are currently in active negotiations for the disposition of three land sites and we expect to put an operating property into the market for sale in 2025.  If successful, these sales in aggregate could generate approximately $200.0 million of net proceeds in 2025, although it is possible that one of the land sales does not close until 2026.  However, there can be no assurance that we will complete any of these transactions on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nWe may seek to enhance our liquidity to fund our current and future development activity, pursue additional attractive investment opportunities and refinance or repay indebtedness.  Depending on then-current interest rates, \n77\nTable of Contents\n     \nthe overall conditions in the public and private debt and equity markets, and our existing and expected leverage at the time, we may decide to access one or more of these capital sources.  Doing so may result in greater cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds, and depending on the sources of liquidity, higher interest expense or share count. \nWe have not sold any shares under BXP’s $600.0 million “at the market” equity offering program.\nInflation \nWe are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations.  There are provisions in the majority of our client leases that protect us from, and mitigate the near term risk of, the impact of inflation.  These provisions include rent steps and resets to market, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance.  However, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the rent may not increase frequently enough to fully cover inflation.\nREIT Tax Distribution Considerations \nDividend \nAs a REIT, BXP is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that BXP currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments).  Our policy is for BXP to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax.  Holders of common and LTIP units (other than unearned MYLTIP units) of limited partnership interest in BPLP receive the same distribution per unit that is paid per share of BXP common stock.  \nBXP’s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate BXP’s dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income (including gains on sales), liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by BXP’s Board of Directors will not differ materially from the current quarterly dividend amount. \nSales \nTo the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, BXP would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities.  Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of BXP’s common stock and REIT distribution requirements.  At a minimum, we expect that BXP would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for BXP to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. \nFrom time to time in select cases, whether due to a change in use, structuring issues to comply with applicable REIT regulations or other reasons, we may sell an asset that is held by a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).  Such a sale by a TRS would be subject to federal and local taxes.  \nCash Flow Summary\nThe following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.\nCash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrows aggregated approximately $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $0.3 billion.  The following table sets forth changes in cash flows:\n78\nTable of Contents\n     \n \nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,234,501 \n$\n1,301,520 \n$\n(67,019)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(1,237,396)\n(1,193,681)\n(43,715)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n(274,476)\n767,916 \n(1,042,392)\nOur principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties.  The weighted-average term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.8 years as of December 31, 2024, with occupancy rates historically in the range of 87% to 92%.  Generally, our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flows that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements.  In addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and through secured and unsecured borrowings.\nCash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures.

The acquisition was completed with available cash.  Following the acquisition, we commenced redevelopment of the property.\n(2)\nConstruction in progress for the year ended December 31, 2024 included ongoing expenditures associated with 760 Boylston Street, 180 CityPoint, 103 CityPoint and 300 Binney Street, which were fully placed in-service during the year ended December 31, 2024.  In addition, we incurred costs associated with our continued development/redevelopment of Reston Next Office Phase II that was partially placed in-service, 290 Binney Street, 121 Broadway and 725 12th Street.  \nConstruction in progress for the year ended December 31, 2023 included ongoing expenditures associated with 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street Building A and the View Boston observatory at The Prudential Center, which were fully placed in-service during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 180 CityPoint and 103 CityPoint that were partially placed in-service during the year ended December 31, 2023.  In addition, we incurred costs associated with our continued development/redevelopment of Reston Next Office Phase II, 760 Boylston Street, 105 Carnegie Center, 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street.  On November 30, 2023, we elected to suspend redevelopment on 105 Carnegie Center located in Princeton, New Jersey.\n79\nTable of Contents\n     \n(3)\nOn January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue, located in Washington, DC, for a gross purchase price of $10.0 million and we acquired net working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $16.1 million.\nOn December 14, 2023, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 45% interest in the joint venture entity that owns Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California.  The acquisition was completed for a gross purchase price of $38.0 million and we acquired net working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $20 million.  Santa Monica Business Park is a 47-acre office park consisting of 21 buildings totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet.  \n(4)\nCapital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of cash contributions of approximately $62.7 million, $32.1 million, $13.5 million and $11.6 million to our 360 Park Avenue South, Gateway Commons, Platform 16 and Dock 72 joint ventures, respectively.\nCapital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of cash contributions of approximately $62.6 million, $42.7 million, $18.0 million, $18.0 million, $14.9 million, $10.6 million and $10.1 million to our Gateway Commons, Platform 16, Worldgate Drive, Dock 72, 360 Park Avenue South, 751 Gateway and Safeco Plaza joint ventures, respectively.  On January 31, 2023, we entered into a new joint venture for 13100 and 13150 Worldgate Drive located in Herndon, Virginia.\n(5)\nCapital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of cash distributions\n from our 360 Park Avenue South joint venture.  \n(6)\nOn October 2, 2023, a joint venture in which we owned a 20% interest completed the restructuring of Metropolitan Square which included among other items, the closing of a new mezzanine loan with a maximum principal amount of $100.0 million.  The new mezzanine loan may be drawn upon for future lease-up, operating and other costs on an as needed basis, and amounts borrowed will bear interest at a per annum rate of 12%, compounded monthly.  We will fund 20%, or up to $20.0 million, of any amounts borrowed under the new mezzanine loan.  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had funded approximately $3.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. \nOn June 5, 2023, a joint venture in which we own a 30% interest repaid the existing construction loan collateralized by its 500 North Capitol Street, NW property and obtained new mortgage loans with related parties.  At the time of the payoff, the outstanding balance of the loan totaled approximately $105.0 million and was scheduled to mature on June 6, 2023.  The new mortgage loans have an aggregate principal balance of $105.0 million, bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.83% per annum and mature on June 5, 2026.  Our portion of the mortgage loans, $10.5 million, has been reflected as a Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  500 North Capitol Street, NW is an approximately 231,000 square foot premier workplace in Washington, DC.\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $274.5 million.  This amount consisted primarily of the repayment of BPLP’s $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2024, repayment of $500.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and payment of our regular dividends and distributions to our shareholders and unitholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests in property partnerships, partially offset by the issuance of BPLP’s $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035, $500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper borrowings, and $374.7 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests in property partnerships and proceeds from the sale of a 45% interest in 290 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading \n“Debt Financing\n.”\n80\nTable of Contents\n     \nCapitalization\nThe following table presents Consolidated Market Capitalization and BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization, as well as the corresponding ratios of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization and BXP’s Share of Debt to BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization (in thousands, except for percentages):\nDecember 31, 2024\nShares / Units Outstanding\nCommon Stock Equivalent\nEquivalent Value (1)\nCommon Stock\n158,175 \n158,175 \n$\n11,761,893 \nCommon Operating Partnership Units\n18,066 \n18,066 \n1,343,388 \n(2)\nTotal Equity\n176,241 \n$\n13,105,281 \nConsolidated Debt \n$\n16,220,499 \nAdd:\nBXP’s share of unconsolidated joint venture debt (3)\n1,383,764 \nSubtract:\nPartners’ share of Consolidated Debt (4)\n1,362,367 \nBXP’s Share of Debt\n$\n16,241,896 \nConsolidated Market Capitalization\n$\n29,325,780 \nBXP’s Share of Market Capitalization\n$\n29,347,177 \nConsolidated Debt/Consolidated Market Capitalization\n55.31 \n%\nBXP’s Share of Debt/BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization\n55.34 \n%\n_______________  \n(1)\nValues are based on the closing price per share of BXP’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 2024 of $74.36.\n(2)\nIncludes long-term incentive plan units (including 2012 OPP Units and 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units but excluding the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units because the three-year performance periods had not ended as of December 31, 2024).\n(3)\nSee page 88 for additional information.\n(4)\nSee page 86 for additional information.\nConsolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization Ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector.  We present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (A) our consolidated debt by (B) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt.  Consolidated market capitalization is the sum of:\n(1)     our consolidated debt; plus\n(2)     the product of (x) the closing price per share of BXP common stock on December 31, 2024, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of:\n(i)     the number of outstanding shares of common stock of BXP, \n(ii)     the number of outstanding OP Units in BPLP (excluding OP Units held by BXP),\n(iii)     the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, and\n(iv)     the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of 2012 OPP Units, and 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units.\nThe calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned.  Because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units are not included in this calculation as of December 31, 2024.  \n81\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe also present BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization and BXP’s Share of Debt/BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization, which are calculated in the same manner, except that BXP’s Share of Debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator.  BXP’s Share of Debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners’ share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners’ percentage ownership interests adjusted for basis differentials).  Management believes that BXP’s Share of Debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners’ share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis.  We have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures.  We caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating BXP’s Share of Debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture.  For example, in addition to partners’ interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financing and guarantees, liquidations and other matters.  Moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case GAAP requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes.  In other cases, GAAP requires that we consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest.  As a result, management believes that the presentation of BXP’s Share of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios.  Investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of BXP and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations.  However, for a company like BXP, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.\nFor a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see “\nLiquidity and Capital Resources—Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt” w\nithin “\nItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n” and for a discussion of our consolidated joint venture indebtedness see \n“Liquidity and Capital Resources—Mortgage Notes Payable\n” within “\nItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.”\nDebt Financing\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $16.2 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 55.31% of our Consolidated Market Capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $10.6 billion (net of discount and deferred financing fees) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 4.07% per annum and maturities in 2025 through 2035 (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (2) $4.3 billion (net of deferred financing fees and fair value interest adjustments) of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 4.17% per annum and a weighted-average term of 3.8 years, (3) $0.8 billion (net of deferred financing fees and fair value interest adjustments) of unsecured term loans having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 5.88% per annum with maturities in 2025, and (4) $0.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper borrowings having a weighted-average interest rate of 4.79% per annum and a weighted-average maturity of 38 days, from the issuance date.\n82\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe table below summarizes the aggregate carrying value of our outstanding indebtedness, as well as Consolidated Debt Financing Statistics at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.  \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n \n(dollars in thousands)\nDebt Summary:\nBalance\nMortgage notes payable, net\n$\n4,276,609 \n$\n4,166,379 \nUnsecured senior notes, net\n10,645,077 \n10,491,617 \nUnsecured line of credit\n— \n— \nUnsecured term loans, net\n798,813 \n1,198,301 \nUnsecured commercial paper\n500,000 \n— \nConsolidated Debt\n16,220,499 \n15,856,297 \nAdd:\nBXP’s share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, net (1)\n1,383,764 \n1,421,655 \nSubtract:\nPartners’ share of consolidated mortgage notes payable, net (2)\n1,362,367 \n1,360,375 \nBXP’s Share of Debt\n$\n16,241,896 \n$\n15,917,577 \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nConsolidated Debt Financing Statistics:\nPercent of total debt:\nFixed rate (3)\n92.61 \n%\n100.00 \n%\nVariable rate\n7.39 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n100.00 \n%\n100.00 \n%\nGAAP Weighted-average interest rate at end of period:\nFixed rate (3)\n4.11 \n%\n4.11 \n%\nVariable rate\n5.47 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n4.21 \n%\n4.11 \n%\nCoupon/Stated Weighted-average interest rate at end of period:\nFixed rate (3)\n3.89 \n%\n3.96 \n%\nVariable rate\n5.34 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n4.00 \n%\n3.96 \n%\nWeighted-average maturity at end of period (in years):\nFixed rate (3)\n4.6 \n4.6 \nVariable rate\n0.2 \n— \nTotal\n4.3 \n4.6 \n_______________\n(1)\nSee page 88 for additional information.\n(2)\nSee page 86 for additional information. \n(3)\nAt December 31, 2024, BPLP’s $100.0 million 2024 Unsecured Term Loan and two of our mortgage loans aggregating approximately $800.0 million bore interest at variable rates.  We entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the variability of these loans for all or a portion of the applicable debt term and as such, they are reflected in our Fixed rate statistics.  At December 31, 2023, BPLP’s 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and two of our mortgage loans aggregating approximately $900.0 million bore interest at variable rates that were subject to interest rate swaps that effectively fixed the interest rate for all or a portion of the applicable debt term.  As such, they are reflected in our Fixed rate statistics.\n83\nTable of Contents\n     \nUnsecured Credit Facility\nThe 2021 Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $2.0 billion, as described below, through BPLP’s revolving facility, subject to customary conditions.  The 2021 Credit Facility matures on June 15, 2026 and includes a sustainability-linked pricing component.  Under the 2021 Credit Facility, BPLP had the option to increase the original total commitment of $1.5 billion by up to an additional $500.0 million by increasing the amount of the revolving facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions (the “Accordion Option”).  On September 28, 2023, BPLP exercised a portion of the Accordion Option, which increased the then maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility from $1.5 billion to $1.815 billion.  On April 29, 2024, BPLP exercised the remainder of the Accordion Option and further increased the maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility to $2.0 billion.  All other terms of the 2021 Credit Facility remain unchanged.\nBased on BPLP’s December 31, 2024 credit rating, (1) the applicable Daily SOFR, Term SOFR, alternative currency daily rate, and alternative currency term rate margins are 0.850%, (2) the alternate base rate margin is zero basis points and (3) the facility fee is 0.20% per annum.\nThe 2021 Credit Facility is used as a backstop for BPLP’s $500.0 million unsecured commercial paper program (See “\nUnsecured Commercial Paper” \nbelow).  As such, BPLP intends to maintain, at a minimum, availability under the 2021 Credit Facility in an amount equal to the amount of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding.  \nAt December 31, 2024, BPLP had no borrowings under its 2021 Credit Facility, outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $5.4 million, and $500.0 million is being used as a backstop for the commercial paper program.  At February 21, 2025, BPLP had $310.0 million outstanding under its 2021 Credit Facility, outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $5.4 million, and $500.0 million is being used as a backstop for the commercial paper program.  Therefore, at December 31, 2024 and February 21, 2025, BPLP has the ability to borrow approximately $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.\nUnsecured Term Loans\nThe 2023 Unsecured Term Loan provided for a single borrowing of up to $1.2 billion.  Upon entry into the credit agreement in January 2023, BPLP exercised its option to draw $1.2 billion under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan.  Under the credit agreement governing the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, BPLP may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 Unsecured Term Loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions.  On April 29, 2024, BPLP repaid $500.0 million of the outstanding balance under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan from the proceeds of its unsecured commercial paper program (See “\nUnsecured Commercial Paper\n” below).  The 2023 Unsecured Term Loan had an initial maturity date of May 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions.  On May 16, 2024, BPLP exercised its option to extend the maturity date of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan to May 16, 2025.  All other terms of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan remain unchanged. \nAt BPLP’s option, loans under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, (b) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (c) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, and (d) 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating.  \nOn September 27, 2024, BPLP entered into the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan with the Lender under the SMBP Loan.  Upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw $100.0 million under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan.  The proceeds were used to repay the portion of the SMBP Loan held by the Lender.  After the repayment, the SMBP Loan had a remaining principal balance of $200.0 million (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan matures on September 26, 2025 with three, one-year extension options, subject to customary conditions.\nAt BPLP’s option, loans under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) zero, (b) Prime Rate, (c) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (d) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.10%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating.  \n84\nTable of Contents\n     \nBased on BPLP’s December 31, 2024 credit rating, (1) the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 1.05% per annum and (2) the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.05% per annum.  The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan is subject to an existing interest rate swap to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a fixed rate of approximately 2.688% per annum for a period that ends on April 1, 2025 (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  At December 31, 2024 and February 21, 2025, BPLP had $700.0 million and $100.0 million of principal outstanding under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and 2024 Unsecured Term Loan, respectively. \nUnsecured Senior Notes\nFor a description of BPLP’s outstanding unsecured senior notes as of December 31, 2024, See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 1, 2024, BPLP repaid $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% senior notes due February 1, 2024.  The repayment was completed with available cash.  The repayment price was approximately $713.3 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date.  Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid.\nOn August 26, 2024, BPLP completed a public offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035.  The notes were priced at 99.961% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 5.842% per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on January 15, 2035, unless earlier redeemed.  The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $841.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.\nOn January 15, 2025, BPLP repaid $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.200% senior notes due January 15, 2025.  The repayment was completed with available cash and the proceeds from BPLP’s August 2024 offering of unsecured senior notes.  The repayment price was approximately $863.6 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $13.6 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date.  Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid.  \nThe indenture relating to the unsecured senior notes contains certain financial restrictions and requirements, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150% of unsecured debt.  At December 31, 2024, BPLP was in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements.\nUnsecured Commercial Paper \nOn April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program.  Under the terms of the program, BPLP may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $500.0 million with varying maturities of up to one year.  Amounts available under the unsecured commercial paper program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time.  The notes are sold in private placements and rank pari passu with all of BPLP’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, including its outstanding senior notes.  The unsecured commercial paper program is backstopped by available capacity under the 2021 Credit Facility.  At December 31, 2024, BPLP had an aggregate of $500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding that bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.79% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 38 days, from the issuance date.  At February 21, 2025, BPLP had an aggregate of $500.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding that bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.64% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 46 days, from the issuance date.  Proceeds from the unsecured commercial paper program were used to reduce BPLP’s 2023 Unsecured Term Loan from $1.2 billion to $700.0 million.\nMortgage Notes Payable\nOn January 8, 2024, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The property is subject to existing mortgage indebtedness.  At acquisition, the mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $207.1 million, bore interest at 3.61% per annum and was scheduled to mature on January 5, 2025.  The mortgage loan was recorded at a fair value of approximately $198.7 million.  On \n85\nTable of Contents\n     \nJanuary 11, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan to provide for two extension options totaling five years of additional term, each subject to certain conditions.  On December 20, 2024, we exercised the first extension option to extend the maturity date to January 5, 2029.  At the time of the extension, the outstanding principal balance was $202.3 million.  The extended loan bears interest at 5.00% per annum beginning January 5, 2025.  The loan has a one-year extension option remaining, subject to certain conditions. \nOn October 8, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan collateralized by our Santa Monica Business Park properties located in Santa Monica, California.  The mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of $200.0 million, bore interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 19, 2025.  The modified loan is scheduled to mature on October 8, 2028 and continues to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum until July 19, 2025.  Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.60% per annum through the maturity date.  The entire principal is subject to interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 2.675% per annum through April 1, 2025 (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The mortgage loan requires monthly interest-only payments during the term of the loan, with the entire principal due at maturity.  Santa Monica Business Park is an office park consisting of 21 buildings totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet.\nThe following represents the outstanding mortgage notes payable, net at December 31, 2024:\nProperties\nStated Interest Rate\nGAAP Interest Rate (1)\nStated Principal Amount\nFair Value Adjustment and Deferred Financing Costs, Net \nCarrying Amount\nCarrying Amount (Partners\n’\n Share)\nMaturity Date\n \n(dollars in thousands)\nWholly-owned\n901 New York Avenue\n3.61 \n%\n7.69 \n%\n$\n202,313 \n$\n(621)\n$\n201,692 \nN/A\n(2)\nJanuary 5, 2029\nSanta Monica Business Park\n4.05 \n%\n6.65 \n%\n200,000 \n(1,979)\n198,021 \nN/A\n(3)(4)\nOctober 8, 2028\n90 Broadway, 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, and Cambridge East Garage (also known as Kendall Center Green Garage)\n6.04 \n%\n6.27 \n%\n600,000 \n(5,131)\n594,869 \nN/A\n(3)(5)\nOctober 26, 2028\nSubtotal\n1,002,313 \n(7,731)\n994,582 \nN/A\nConsolidated Joint Ventures\n767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building)\n3.43 \n%\n3.64 \n%\n2,300,000 \n(8,502)\n2,291,498 \n$\n916,629 \n(3)(6)(7)\nJune 9, 2027\n601 Lexington Avenue\n2.79 \n%\n2.93 \n%\n1,000,000 \n(9,471)\n990,529 \n445,738 \n(3)(8)\nJanuary 9, 2032\nSubtotal\n3,300,000 \n(17,973)\n3,282,027 \n1,362,367 \nTotal\n$\n4,302,313 \n$\n(25,704)\n$\n4,276,609 \n$\n1,362,367 \n_______________ \n(1)\nThe GAAP interest rate differs from the stated interest rate due to the inclusion of the amortization of financing charges, the effects of hedging transactions (if any) and adjustments required under Accounting Standards Codification 805 “Business Combinations” to reflect loans and swaps at their fair values (if any).\n(2)\nCarrying amount includes an approximately $0.1 million fair value interest adjustment.  Beginning January 5, 2025, the loan will bear interest at a stated fixed rate of 5.0% per annum.  The loan has a one-year extension option remaining, subject to certain conditions.\n(3)\nThe mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.\n(4)\nThe mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The borrower under the loan entered into interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 2.675% for the period commencing on February 1, 2023 and ending on April 1, 2025.  Stated interest rate reflects the weighted average fixed interest rate based on the interest rate swap contracts plus 1.38% per annum.  Carrying amount includes an approximately $1.0 million fair value interest adjustment and excludes the adjustment required to reflect the interest rate swap at fair value upon acquisition of approximately $0.9 million.  Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.60% per annum through the maturity date.\n(5)\nThe mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of Daily Compounded SOFR plus 2.25% per annum.  On December 7, 2023, BPLP entered into three interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $600.0 million to fix Daily Compounded SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.7925% for the period commencing on December 15, 2023 and ending on October 26, 2028.  The stated interest rate reflects the weighted average fixed interest rate based on the interest rate swap contracts plus 2.25% per annum. \n86\nTable of Contents\n     \n(6)\nThis property is owned by a consolidated entity in which we have a 60% interest.  The partners’ share of the carrying amount has been adjusted for basis differentials.\n(7)\nIn connection with the refinancing of the loan, we guaranteed the consolidated entity’s obligation to fund various reserves for tenant improvement costs and allowances, leasing commissions and free rent obligations in lieu of cash deposits.

Fourteen of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness.  We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities.  As a result, we account for them using the equity method of accounting.  See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  At December 31, 2024, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners’ share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $3.2 billion (of which our proportionate share is approximately $1.4 billion).  The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2024.

The joint venture entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a financial institution to limit its exposure to increases in the SOFR rate at a cap of 2.50% per annum on a notional amount of $250.0 million through September 1, 2025.\n(10)\nThe indebtedness consists of (x) a $70.0 million mortgage loan payable (Note A) which bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.23% per annum, and (y) a $35.0 million mortgage loan payable (Note B) which bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.03% per annum. We provided $10.5 million of the Note B mortgage financing to the joint venture. Our portion of the loan is reflected as Related Party Note Receivables, Net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(11)\nThe joint venture entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $600.0 million through June 2028, resulting in a fixed rate of approximately 4.34% per annum through the expiration of the interest rate swap contracts.

The joint venture is negotiating a new third-party loan, however, there can be no assurance that the joint venture will enter into a new third-party loan on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.  We are the lender of the loan, and the loan and accrued interest are reflected as Related Party Note Receivables, Net and Tenant and Other Receivables, Net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(13)\nThe construction financing has a borrowing capacity of $140.0 million.\n89\nTable of Contents\n     \nMarket Risk \nMarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates.  Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates.  Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates.  The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates.  We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration.  We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately 92.61% of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures and after taking into account hedging agreements, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of the hedging agreements.  We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions.  Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions.  This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt.  Our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.\nIncluding the effects of interest rate swaps, at December 31, 2024, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on our fixed rate outstanding Consolidated Debt was 3.89% per annum.  At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $2.1 billion of consolidated variable rate debt outstanding, including $800.0 million of unsecured term loans, $500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper borrowings and approximately $800.0 million of secured debt.  However, we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating $800.0 million for our secured debt and $100.0 million for BPLP’s 2024 Unsecured Term Loan, thus fixing the interest rates for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to interest rate contracts in place as of December 31, 2024 and their respective fair values).  For example, if market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $21.0 million, on an annualized basis, for the year ended December 31, 2024.  \nThe information above does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt.  For a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “\nItem 7\n—\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n—\nLiquidity and Capital Resources—Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt.\n”\nFunds from Operations\nPursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), we calculate Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” for each of BXP and BPLP by adjusting net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (computed in accordance with GAAP), respectively, for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, including a change in control, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization.  FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and helps make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.  Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales or a change in control of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. \nOur computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently.  We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to BXP, Inc. or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  \n90\nTable of Contents\n     \nBXP\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to BXP, Inc. to FFO attributable to BXP, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in thousands)\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc.\n$\n14,272 \n$\n190,215 \n$\n848,947 \nAdd:\nNoncontrolling interest—common units of the Operating Partnership\n2,400 \n22,548 \n96,780 \nNoncontrolling interests in property partnerships\n67,516 \n78,661 \n74,857 \nNet income\n84,188 \n291,424 \n1,020,584 \nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization \n887,191 \n830,813 \n749,775 \nNoncontrolling interests in property partnerships’ share of depreciation and amortization\n(76,660)\n(73,027)\n(70,208)\nBXP’s share of depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures\n81,904 \n101,199 \n89,275 \nCorporate-related depreciation and amortization\n(1,710)\n(1,810)\n(1,679)\nNon-real estate depreciation and amortization\n8,520 \n(1,681)\n— \nImpairment loss\n13,615 \n— \n— \nImpairment losses included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures (1)\n341,338 \n272,603 \n50,705 \nLess:\nGain on sale / consolidation included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures (2)\n21,696 \n28,412 \n— \nGain on investment included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures (3)\n— \n35,756 \n— \nGains on sales of real estate\n602 \n517 \n437,019 \nGain on sales-type lease\n— \n— \n10,058 \nGain on sales-type lease included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures\n— \n1,368 \n— \nUnrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investment\n546 \n239 \n(150)\nNoncontrolling interests in property partnerships\n67,516 \n78,661 \n74,857 \nFunds from Operations (FFO) attributable to the Operating Partnership common unitholders (including BXP, Inc.)\n1,248,026 \n1,274,568 \n1,316,668 \nLess:\nNoncontrolling interest—common units of the Operating Partnership’s share of funds from operations\n127,548 \n130,771 \n             \n133,115 \nFunds from Operations attributable to BXP, Inc.\n$\n1,120,478 \n$\n1,143,797 \n$\n1,183,553 \nOur percentage share of Funds from Operations—basic\n89.78 \n%\n89.74 \n%\n89.89 \n%\nWeighted average shares outstanding—basic\n157,468 \n156,863 \n156,726 \n___________\n(1)\nThe impairment loss on investment in unconsolidated joint venture consists of an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments in (i) Colorado Center, Gateway Commons and Safeco Plaza aggregating approximately $341.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) Platform 16, 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue and Safeco Plaza aggregating approximately $272.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and (iii) the Dock 72 unconsolidated joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2022.  \n(2)\nOn January 8, 2024, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC for a gross purchase price of $10.0 million.

In addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year.  These contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties.

In addition, we signed leases for approximately 286,600 square feet of first generation leases.  The client-related obligations for the development properties are included within the projects’ “Estimated Total Investment” referred to in “\nItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\n  In the aggregate, during 2024, we signed leases for approximately 5.6 million square feet of space and incurred aggregate client-related obligations of approximately $597.3 million, or approximately $106 per square foot.\nAdopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”).  ASU 2023-07 improves reportable segment disclosure requirements for public business entities primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit (referred to as the “significant expense principle”).  ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2024. While the adoption has no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, it has resulted in incremental disclosures within the footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, “Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60)” (“ASU 2023-05”).  ASU 2023-05 is intended to (1) address accounting for contributions made to a joint venture upon formation and (2) reduce diversity in practice.  This ASU will apply to joint ventures that meet the definition of a corporate joint venture under GAAP, thus limiting its scope to joint ventures not controlled and therefore not consolidated by any joint venture investor.  This accounting standard is effective for joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025.  We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2025.\n97\nTable of Contents\n     \nNewly Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)” (“ASU 2024-03”):  ASU 2024-03 will require entities to provide enhanced disclosures related to certain expense categories included in income statement captions. The ASU aims to increase transparency and provide investors with more detailed information about the nature of expenses reported on the face of the income statement. The new standard does not change the requirements for the presentation of expenses on the face of the income statement.  Under this ASU, entities are required to disaggregate, in a tabular format, expense captions presented on the face of the income statement — excluding earnings or losses from equity method investments — if they include any of the following expense categories: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation or depletion.  For any remaining items within each relevant expense caption, entities must provide a qualitative description of the nature of those expenses. The new ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes. \n98\nTable of Contents",
