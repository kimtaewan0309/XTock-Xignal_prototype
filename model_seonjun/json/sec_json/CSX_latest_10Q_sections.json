MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThird Quarter 2025\nRevenue\nTotal revenue decreased 1% in third quarter 2025 when compared to third quarter 2024, due to decreases in export coal revenue, including the impact of lower benchmark rates, as well as declines in merchandise volume. These decreases were partially offset by increases in other revenue, higher pricing in merchandise, and intermodal volume growth. \nMerchandise Volume\nChemicals\n - Decreased due to lower shipments of crude oil, petroleum products, other industrial chemicals, and plastics.\nAgricultural and Food Products\n - Decreased due to lower shipments of domestic feed grain, ethanol, and soybeans.\nMinerals\n - Increased primarily due to higher shipments of aggregates and cement.\n    \nAutomotive \n- Increased due to higher North American vehicle production.  \nForest Products\n - Decreased due to lower shipments of pulp and paper products, which includes the impact of both temporary outages and permanent plant closures, as well as lower shipments of building products.\nMetals and Equipment\n - Increased due to higher scrap and pipe shipments. Increases were partially offset by lower steel shipments, which includes the impact of plant closures, as well as lower equipment shipments.\nFertilizers\n - Increased due to higher shipments of raw materials, as well as higher exports through Gulf Coast ports.\nIntermodal Volume\nInternational shipments increased driven by higher port volumes and growth with key customers. Domestic shipments increased, despite the impacts of a continued soft trucking environment, due to share wins with key customers and new service offerings.\nCoal Volume\nExport coal decreased primarily due to reduced production, including impacts from outages at customer facilities. Domestic coal increased due to higher shipments to utility plants, partially offset by lower shipments to steel manufacturing locations and lake terminals.\n \nTrucking Revenue\nTrucking revenue decreased $7 million versus the prior year due to lower rates and fuel surcharge.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue increased $43 million primarily due to higher carload demurrage and payments from customers that did not meet volume commitments.\nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.34\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExpenses \nExpenses of $2.5 billion increased $235 million, or 10%, in third quarter 2025 when compared to the third quarter 2024. \nLabor and Fringe\n expense increased $9 million due to the following:\n•\nAn increase of $22 million was due to management and executive severance costs.\n•\nAn increase of $15 million was due to inflation.\n•\nA decrease of $19 million resulted from lower incentive compensation expense driven by lower expected payouts.\n•\nAll other net costs decreased $9 million driven by efficiency savings, which include the impact of lower rail headcount, and other non-significant net decreases. These items were partially offset by higher trucking headcount, which includes impacts from acquiring previously independent affiliates. \nPurchased Services and Other\n expense increased $54 million due to the following: \n•\nInflation and higher volume drove an increase of $18 million.\n•\nAn increase of $13 million was due to technology contract restructuring costs as well as advisory expenses.\n•\nIncreased costs of approximately $13 million were due to the effects of network disruptions and rerouting impacts.\n•\nGains on property dispositions were $7 million in third quarter 2025 compared to a $1 million loss in the prior year.\n•\nAll other net costs increased $18 million resulting from a favorable inventory adjustment in the prior year, higher trucking casualty and rail freight damage claims in the current year, and other non-significant increases, which were partially offset by efficiency savings across the organization. \nDepreciation and Amortization\n expense increased $8 million primarily as a result of a larger asset base.\nFuel\n costs increased $5 million as the impacts of additional gross ton-miles associated with reroutes as well as a 1% increase in locomotive fuel prices were partially offset by improved efficiency.\nEquipment and Other Rents\n expense decreased $5 million due to several non-significant items.\nGoodwill Impairment \nexpense for Quality Carriers was $164 million for 2025. \nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $4 million primarily due to higher average debt balances.\nOther Income - Net\nOther income - net decreased $15 million primarily due to lower interest income.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $86 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes.\nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.35\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNine Months Results of Operations\nRevenue\n decreased $417 million primarily due to lower coal revenue, which includes the impact of lower global benchmark rates, as well as lower fuel recovery and declines in merchandise volume. These declines were partially offset by pricing gains in merchandise. \nTotal expense\n increased $311 million primarily due to the Quality Carriers goodwill impairment, inflation, costs due to network disruptions, and higher depreciation. These increases were partially offset by lower fuel prices and efficiency savings.\nInterest expense\n increased $6 million as higher average debt balances were mostly offset by higher capitalized interest.\nOther income - net\n decreased $36 million primarily due to lower interest income and lower pension benefit credits.\nIncome tax expense\n decreased $202 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes. \nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.36\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Measures - Unaudited\nCSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.\nAdjusted Operating Results\nManagement believes that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted net earnings per share, assuming dilution are important in evaluating the Company's performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude the third quarter 2025 non-cash impairment of the remaining amount of Quality Carriers' goodwill, which is a significant item that is not considered indicative of future financial trends. The goodwill impairment was tax-effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts related to the impairment charge. These adjusted results should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP operating results. \nThe following tables reconcile the Company's GAAP operating results to adjusted operating results (non-GAAP measures).\nQuarter Ended September 30, 2025\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOperating Income\nOperating Margin\nNet Earnings\nNet Earnings Per Share, Assuming Dilution\nGAAP Operating Results\n$\n1,087\n \n30.3\n \n%\n$\n694\n \n$\n0.37\n \nGoodwill Impairment\n164 \n4.6 \n124 \n0.07 \nAdjusted Operating Results (non-GAAP)\n$\n1,251 \n34.9 \n%\n$\n818 \n$\n0.44 \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOperating Income\nOperating Margin\nNet Earnings\nNet Earnings Per Share, Assuming Dilution\nGAAP Operating Results\n$\n3,411\n \n32.2\n \n%\n$\n2,169\n \n$\n1.16\n \nGoodwill Impairment\n164 \n1.6 \n124 \n0.06 \nAdjusted Operating Results (non-GAAP)\n$\n3,575 \n33.8 \n%\n$\n2,293 \n$\n1.22 \nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.37\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEconomic Profit\nManagement believes Economic Profit provides an additional perspective to investors about financial returns generated by the business by representing a measure showing profit generated over and above the cost of capital used by the business to generate that profit. Economic Profit is designed to incentivize strategic investments that earn more than management’s desired minimum required return and is broadly utilized by management to make investment decisions. Therefore, disclosing Economic Profit on how management performs in this regard provides additional useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance compared to its goals.\nEconomic Profit should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, operating income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic Profit is defined by the Company as Gross Cash Earnings (“GCE”) minus the Capital Charge on Gross Operating Assets (“GOA”). Increases in Economic Profit indicate that the Company is effectively allocating capital and rewarding shareholders by generating returns in excess of the incremental cost of capital associated with reinvestment in the business.\n \nGCE is calculated as operating income plus depreciation, amortization and operating lease expense, less unusual items and taxes. The Capital Charge uses a minimum required return multiplied by the GOA. CSX's GOAs include gross properties and other non-cash assets, net of non-interest bearing liabilities. The Company used a 15% tax rate and an 8% required return, for both periods presented, which is consistent with rates used for investment decisions and performance evaluation within those same periods. The tax rate is the approximate equivalent of the Company’s actual income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax GCE. The required return rate represents management’s desired minimum return on any investment. CSX annually re-evaluates these rates to ensure they accurately represent taxes and a required return in light of internal and external factors and would adjust the rate if the annual review resulted in a preset deviation from the current rates. This focuses the Economic Profit measure on value generated by management instead of external factors, such as legislative tax policy or interest rate volatility. \nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.38\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table reconciles operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to Economic Profit (non-GAAP measure).\nNine Months\n(Dollars in Millions)\n2025\n2024\nOperating Income\n$\n3,411\n \n$\n4,139\n \nAdd: Depreciation, Amortization, and Operating Lease Expense\n1,359 \n1,323 \nRemove: Unusual Items \n(a)\n164 \n— \nTaxes \n(b)\n(740)\n(819)\nGross Cash Earnings\n4,194 \n4,643 \nOperating Assets\nCurrent Assets (Less Cash and Short-term Investments)\n1,893 \n1,940 \nGross Properties\n53,290 \n51,062 \nOther Assets\n4,310 \n4,255 \nOperating Liabilities\nNon-Interest Bearing Liabilities \n(c)\n(11,038)\n(10,957)\nGross Operating Assets\n \n(d)\n48,455 \n46,300 \nCapital Charge \n(e)\n(2,907)\n(2,778)\nEconomic Profit (Non-GAAP)\ncalculated as GCE less Capital Charge\n$\n1,287 \n$\n1,865 \n(a) Unusual items are defined by management as unique events with greater than $100 million full year operating income impact, consistent with the terms of the Company's long-term incentive plan agreements. The Quality Carriers goodwill impairment charge of $164 million in third quarter 2025 met the definition of an unusual item. \n(b) The tax percentage rate was 15% for both periods presented. This rate is applied to the sum of operating income, depreciation, amortization, operating lease expense, and unusual items.\n(c) Non-interest bearing liabilities represents all liabilities excluding debt, long-term lease liabilities, and commercial paper ($75 million of commercial paper was outstanding in other current liabilities as of June 30, 2025, and none outstanding in any other period). \n(d) Gross operating assets reflects an average of the year-to-date quarter-end amounts reported for each period presented.\n(e) The capital charge of 8% for both years is calculated as the minimum return multiplied by gross operating assets. This is an annualized rate equivalent to 2% per quarter.  \nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.39\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFree Cash Flow\nManagement believes that Free Cash Flow (\"FCF\") is supplemental information useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, FCF measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. FCF is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds and advances from pr\noperty dispositions. FCF \nshould be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. \nThe decrease in FCF before dividends from the prior year of $1.2 billion is primarily due to higher property additions, including $440 million related to rebuilding the Blue Ridge subdivision, as well as $429 million of federal and state tax payments related to the 2024 tax year that were previously postponed and lower cash-generating net earnings. Tax payment postponements related to hurricane tax relief were available in 2023 and 2024, but not in 2025. \nThe following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to FCF before dividends (non-GAAP measure). \nNine Months\n(Dollars in Millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,227\n \n$\n3,859\n \nProperty Additions\n(2,225)\n(1,691)\nProceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions\n64 \n50 \nFree Cash Flow (before payment of dividends)\n$\n1,066 \n$\n2,218 \nOperating Statistics \n(Estimated)\nThe Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, velocity increased by 2%, and dwell improved 8% versus prior year. Carload trip plan performance increased by 4% and intermodal trip plan performance increased by 1%. The Company continues to focus on operational improvements and executing the operating plan to deliver safe, reliable, and efficient service to customers. \nThe personal injury frequency index of 1.16 in third quarter 2025 improved 7% compared to prior year and the FRA train accident rate of 2.55 improved 21%. Safety is a top priority at CSX, and the Company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers, and communities in which it operates.\nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.40\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nThe following are material changes in the significant cash flows, sources of cash and liquidity, capital investments, consolidated balance sheets and working capital, which provide an update to the discussion included in CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K.\nMaterial Changes in Significant Cash Flows \nSignificant Cash Flows \n    The following chart highlights the operating, investing and financing components of the net decrease of $321 million and increase of $291 million in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and September 30, 2024, respectively.\n \n \n•\nThe Company generated $632 million less cash from operating activities primarily due to the payment of $429 million of previously postponed taxes and lower cash-generating net earnings. \n•\nCSX used $423 million more cash for investing activities primarily due to higher property additions consistent with planned capital expenditures, including approximately $440 million in property additions related to rebuilding the Blue Ridge subdivision as a result of impacts from Hurricane Helene. This increase was partially offset by lower spending on acquisitions of previously independent trucking affiliates.\n•\nThe Company used $443 million less cash for financing activities driven by lower repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by higher share repurchases.\nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.42\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSources of Cash and Liquidity and Uses of Cash\nAs of the end of third quarter 2025, CSX had $618 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. See Note 7, \nDebt and Credit Agreements\n. \nThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 27, 2025, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, CSX issued a total of $600 million of long-term debt.\nCSX has a $1.2 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in February 2028. At September 30, 2025, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured short-term commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any time. At September 30, 2025, the Company had no debt outstanding under the commercial paper program.\nPlanned capital investments for 2025 are expected to be consistent with 2024 spending at approximately $2.5 billion, except for additional costs to rebuild the Blue Ridge subdivision as a result of impacts from Hurricane Helene. Total spending on the Blue Ridge rebuild will exceed $500 million, including approximately $50 million spent in 2024 and approximately $440 million spent in the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Spending to sustain core infrastructure with a focus on safety and reliability will also remain a top priority. In addition, management is committed to investments that promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives, which includes investments in locomotives and freight cars. CSX intends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations.\nThe Company's planned cash income tax payments and related payable and deferred liabilities were impacted by changes in bonus tax depreciation that were enacted into law on July 4, 2025, as part of Public Law 119-21, commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The impact of applying this provision will result in favorable cash tax impacts of approximately $250 million for the 2025 tax year.\nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.43\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMaterial Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \nTotal assets increased $515 million from year end primarily due to a $876 million increase in net property consistent with planned capital expenditures, including incremental property additions related to rebuilding the Blue Ridge subdivision, and a $78 million increase in investments in affiliates and other companies. These increases were partially offset by a $321 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents as noted above and a $164 million impairment of Quality Carriers' goodwill.\nTotal liabilities increased $264 million from year end primarily due to the issuance of $600 million in long-term debt, partially offset by a $344 million decrease in income and other taxes payable primarily resulting from the payment of previously postponed federal and state income taxes. Total shareholders' equity increased $251 million from year end primarily driven by net earnings of $2.2 billion, offset by share repurchases of $1.3 billion and dividends paid of $730 million.\nWorking capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital deficit of $455 million as of September 30, 2025, and $456 million as of December 31, 2024. Flat working capital was primarily the result of a decline in cash, offset by a decrease in income and other taxes payable due to payments for previously postponed income taxes. The Company's working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. The Company continues to maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. \nCSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.\nLABOR AGREEMENTS\nApproximately 17,400 of the Company's approximately 23,200 employees are members of a rail labor union and covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads or CSX-specific agreements. As of the date of this filing, new agreements with an effective date of January 1, 2025, have been fully ratified by most unions, representing nearly 75% of the Company's unionized workforce. The remaining unionized employees are covered under previous agreements while negotiations take place since collective agreements under the Railway Labor Act do not expire, but continue until amended or replaced. \nCSX Q3 2025 Form 10-Q p.44\nTable of Contents\n \nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the areas below. For further discussion of CSX's critical accounting estimates, see the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K.  \n•\npersonal injury and environmental reserves;\n•\npension plan accounting; and\n•\ndepreciation policies for assets under the group-life method.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.
