Waters products and services primarily consist of high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC\nTM\n” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”), light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments (Wyatt), and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. \n \nAcquisition of BD Biosciences & Diagnostic Solutions Businesses \n \nOn July 13, 2025, the Company entered into definitive agreements with BD, Augusta SpinCo Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of BD (“SpinCo”), and Beta Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Waters (“Merger Sub”), with respect to a Reverse Morris Trust transaction valued at approximately $17.5 billion as of the date of signing, and pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of such definitive agreements, (i) BD will transfer (or cause to be transferred) and SpinCo will accept and assume (or cause to be accepted and assumed) all of the rights, titles and interests to and under certain assets and liabilities relating to BD’s Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business, (ii) BD will distribute to its shareholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of SpinCo (“SpinCo Common Stock”) held by BD by way of a pro rata distribution (the “Spin-Off” and the disposition by BD of 100% of the SpinCo Common Stock by way of the Spin-Off, the “Distribution”) and (iii) following the Distribution, Merger Sub will be merged with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo as the surviving entity (the “Merger”), and all SpinCo Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), as calculated and subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement (as defined herein). When the Merger is completed, SpinCo will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Waters. Upon completion of the Merger, BD’s shareholders are expected to own approximately 39.2% of the combined company, and existing Waters Corporation shareholders are expected to own approximately 60.8% of the combined company. This strategic combination is expected to create a leading global life sciences and diagnostics company with enhanced scale, complementary capabilities and expanded end-market exposure. \n \nThe definitive agreements entered into in connection with the transaction include (i) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of July 13, 2025, by and among Waters, BD, SpinCo and Merger Sub, and (ii) a Separation Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”), dated as of July 13, 2025, by and among Waters, BD and SpinCo. As set forth in the Merger Agreement, Waters, BD and SpinCo will also enter into several additional agreements in connection with the transaction. \n \nPrior to, and as a condition of, the Distribution, SpinCo will make a cash payment to BD equal to $4.0 billion (the “SpinCo Cash Distribution”), subject to adjustment for cash, working capital and indebtedness of SpinCo and subject to decrease if additional shares of Company Common Stock will be issued to the Company’s shareholders. The SpinCo Cash Distribution is expected to be paid using proceeds from approximately $4.0 billion of new indebtedness to be incurred by SpinCo prior to the Distribution. The Company is expected to assume all indebtedness incurred by SpinCo in connection with the payment of the SpinCo Cash Distribution upon completion of the Merger. Based on information available through the date of this report, if the transaction closes, the Company estimates it will incur transaction-related expenses and financing fees of approximately $140 million in total. \n\n\n \n \n30 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nIn order to preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off under the Reverse Morris Trust framework, the exchange ratio for the merger consideration specified in the Merger Agreement (the “Exchange Ratio”) may be adjusted and increased, if necessary, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Exchange Ratio is adjusted upwards, the Company may issue a pre-closing cash dividend to the shareholders of the Company (the “Waters Special Dividend”) and/or the SpinCo Cash Distribution could be decreased to account for the value of the additional shares issued to the Company’s shareholders. \n \nThe transaction is expected to close around the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2026, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals, shareholder approval from the Company’s shareholders and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. \n \nAcquisition of Halo Labs \n \nOn May 20, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Optofluidics, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiary, Halo Labs LTD (collectively, “Halo Labs”), for $35 million, net of cash acquired. Halo Labs offers high throughput biopharmaceutical formulation, stability and product quality control tools for aggregate and subvisible particle analysis through the use of custom optics and image processing techniques. As a result of the acquisition, the results of Halo Labs are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. \n \nTariffs \n \nThe Company sells and services its customers in over 35 countries outside of the U.S. and we have manufacturing operations in the U.S., Ireland, U.K. and in Singapore where we utilize subcontractors with worldwide capabilities. \n \nIn 2025, the U.S. government issued varying levels of tariffs on all imported goods into the U.S., including a baseline 10% tariff, subject to certain exceptions, which have also prompted retaliatory tariffs by a number of countries, including tariffs and export restrictions on certain manufacturing components imposed by China and tariffs pursuant to trade agreements the U.S. has entered into with certain countries. In addition, a number of new tariffs have been threatened, and the U.S. and other countries continue to negotiate trade arrangements and tariff levels. In August 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled against certain of the U.S. tariffs that have been implemented. The U.S. government has appealed this ruling, and the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case, with oral arguments anticipated in November 2025. \n \nThese tariffs, any resulting retaliatory tariffs and any related supply-chain disruptions could have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows. In response to currently applicable and potential future tariffs, the Company is continuing to evaluate and implement a series of actions and policies that are intended to offset a portion of the impact of the tariffs on the Company’s financial position and results of operations. While the Company believes that these actions and policies will mitigate a substantial portion of the impact of the tariffs, the Company cannot provide any assurances that the tariffs or any resulting impediments to trade will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows. \n \nIn addition to changes in trade policy, the new U.S. administration has implemented a number of other regulatory, policy and personnel changes, including the elimination, downsizing and reduced funding of certain government agencies and programs and the cancellation or delay of government contracts and research grants, each of which may be exacerbated by the U.S. government shutdown that began in October 2025. In addition, the administration has changed the composition of and guidance from advisory panels on healthcare practices. \n\n\n \n \n31 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nFinancial

of 2025 as compared to the first nine months of 2024. The effect of foreign currency translation had minimal impact on total sales growth for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025. The net sales growth in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 was driven by strong customer demand for the Waters Division products and services across most major geographies, end markets and product lines. \n \nInstrument system sales increased 6% for each of the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, primarily driven by broad-based higher customer demand for our instrument systems in most regions of the world. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on instrument system sales growth for each of the third quarter of 2025 and first nine months of 2025. \n \nRecurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 10% and 8% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, with foreign currency translation increasing sales growth by 1% for the third quarter of 2025 and having a minimal impact on sales growth for the first nine months of 2025. Service revenues increased 8% and 6% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively. Chemistry sales growth increased 14% and 11% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively. The double-digit chemistry sales growth can be attributed to the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers. \n \nOperating income decreased 9% for the third quarter of 2025 primarily due to the impact of the higher sales volume being offset by the change in sales mix, merit increases and approximately $31 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the Merger. In addition, operating income for the third quarter of 2025 included the impact of $6 million of expenses associated with the Company’s new ERP system implementation. \n\n\n \n \n32 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nOperating income decreased by less than 1% for the first nine months of 2025, due to the impact of the higher sales volume and the absence of severance-related costs associated with a workforce reduction in China and certain litigation settlements incurred in 2024, being partially offset by merit increases and $45 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the Merger. In addition, operating income for the first nine months of 2025 also includes the impact of $14 million of expenses associated with the Company’s new ERP system implementation. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased operating income by $9 million. \n \nIn the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, the Company’s interest expense included approximately $14 million of financing costs paid by the Company on behalf of SpinCo in connection with financing activities related to the Merger. \n \nThe Company generated $488 million and $522 million of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Sales to our academic and government customers increased 1% and are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. \n \nWaters Products and Services Net Sales \n \nNet sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nSeptember 27,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n% of\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n% of\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% change\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nWaters instrument systems\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n281,909\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n265,273\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n \nChemistry consumables\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n158,480\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n138,935\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal Waters product sales\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n440,389\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n404,208\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n \nWaters service\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n272,986\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n251,444\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal Waters net sales\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n713,375\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n655,652\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nSeptember 27,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n% of\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 28,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n% of\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% change\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nWaters instrument systems\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n747,099\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n691,760\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n \nChemistry consumables\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n461,102\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n414,227\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal Waters product sales\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n1,208,201\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,105,987\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n \nWaters service\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n781,308\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n734,125\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal Waters net sales\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,989,509\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,840,112\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n% \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nWaters products and services sales increased 9% and 8% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, with foreign currency translation having minimal impact on the third quarter of 2025 and decreasing sales growth by 1% for the first nine months of 2025. \n \nWaters instrument system sales increased by 6% and 8% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, due to higher customer demand for our instrument systems led by the increase in sales of LC-MS instrument systems. The effect of foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales growth for the third quarter and decreased sales growth by 1% for the first nine months of 2025. \n \nWaters chemistry consumables sales grew 14% and 11% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, and was primarily due to the continued demand in most major geographies, driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers.

Foreign currency translation increased sales growth by 1% for each of the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively. \n \nCost of Sales \n \nCost of sales increased 9% in each of the third quarter and first nine months of 2025. The increase is primarily due to higher sales volume. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. \n \nSelling and Administrative Expenses \n \nSelling and administrative expenses increased 27% and 14% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, primarily due to an increase in merit compensation as well as $27 million and $41 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the Merger in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively. In addition, 2025 included $6 million and $14 million of expenses associated with the Company’s new ERP system implementation for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively. The effect of foreign currency translation had minimal impact on selling and administrative expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025. \n \nAs a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 26.8% and 26.4% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, and 22.8% and 24.8% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. \n \nResearch and Development Expenses \n \nResearch and development expenses increased 18% and 9% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively. The increase in these periods was primarily driven by merit compensation; costs associated with the development of new product and technology initiatives; and $4 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the Merger. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased expenses by 2% and 1% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively. \n \nLitigation Provisions\n \nThe Company recorded $12 million of patent litigation settlement provisions and related costs in the first nine months of 2024. No litigation provisions were recorded by the Company in the first nine months of 2025. \n\n\n \n \n36 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nInterest Expense, net \n \nInterest expense, net increased $5 million and decreased $16 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively. The increase in the third quarter of 2025 is primarily a result of $14 million costs paid by the Company on behalf of SpinCo in connection with financing fees associated with financing activities related to the Merger. The decrease in the first nine months of 2025 is primarily a result of lower average outstanding debt as compared to the third quarter of 2024. The average outstanding debt in these periods was impacted by the timing of the repayment of outstanding debt. \n \nProvision for Income Taxes \n \nThe four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 25% and 17%, respectively, as of September 27, 2025. The Company has a Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income by $2 million and $9 million and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.03 and $0.15 for the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively. \n \nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 and 2024 was 12.5% and 16.6%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate can be primarily attributed to the impact of discrete tax benefits in the current year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. \n \nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 and 2024 was 14.9% and 15.0%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate can be attributed to the impact of differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. \n \nEffective in 2024, various foreign jurisdictions began implementing aspects of the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development related to the new Pillar Two system of global minimum tax rules. These changes in tax law did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025. The Company continues to monitor the adoption of the Pillar Two rules in additional jurisdictions. \n \nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. government enacted the One Big Beautiful Tax Bill Act, enacting changes to the United States federal tax code, including adjustments to effective tax rates on certain types of income and certain deduction limitations. The OBBB did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025.

The decrease in 2025 operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher net income being offset by an increase of $24 million in tax payments associated with the final 2018 Tax Reform Transition payment as compared to the prior year; $34 million of costs related to the implementation of the Company’s new ERP system; and $14 million of payments made in connection with merger transaction and integration costs. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding was 85 days at September 27, 2025 and 82 days at September 28, 2024. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe increase in inventory can primarily be attributed to higher tariffs on material costs as well as an increase in safety stock levels to help navigate tariffs and mitigate any future supply chain issues. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nNet cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nOther changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. \n \nCash Flow from Investing Activities\n \nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $110 million and $92 million in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $74 million and $90 million in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. \n \nOn May 20, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of Halo Labs for a total purchase price of $35 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Halo Labs is an innovator of specialized imaging technologies to detect, identify and count interfering materials in therapeutic products, such as cell, protein and gene therapies. \n\n\n \n \n38 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\n \nOn May 22, 2025, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement in respect of that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 17, 2021 and amended as of March 3, 2023, with the lenders and issuing banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, pursuant to which the Company, among other things, reduced the aggregate total borrowing capacity of its existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility by up to $200 million for an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.8 billion. The Credit Facility will mature on May 22, 2030 subject to the Company’s ability to request, subject to customary conditions, a one-year extension to which each lender may, in its discretion, agree. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had a total of $1.4 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $200 million borrowed under its Credit Facility. The Company’s net debt borrowings decreased by $220 million and $530 million during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. \n \nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company and a financial institution executed a 364-day bridge facility commitment letter, pursuant to which such financial institution has committed to provide bridge financing of $1.8 billion to fund dividends, fees and expenses related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on the terms and conditions set forth therein. The bridge facility is expected to be replaced with permanent financing, which may include a delayed draw term loan facility. The Company incurred $5 million of financing costs that are being amortized over the term of the bridge facility. In addition, in connection with financing activities related to the Merger, the Company paid $14 million of financing costs on behalf of SpinCo. These financing costs were expensed in the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025. \n \nAs of September 27, 2025, the Company had entered into interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with durations up to three years with an aggregate notional value of $730 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and yen-denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company lowered net interest expense by approximately $8 million during both the first nine months of 2025 and 2024. The Company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $10 million in 2025. \n \nIn December 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of its existing share repurchase program through January 21, 2028. The Company’s remaining authorization is $1.0 billion. The Company did not make any open market share repurchases in 2025 or 2024. The Company repurchased $15 million and $13 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. \n \nThe Company received $16 million and $25 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. \n \nThe Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $459 million as of September 27, 2025. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $339 million held by foreign subsidiaries as of September 27, 2025, of which $285 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. \n \nContractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends\n \nA summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2025. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 27, 2025 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n \nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. \n \nDuring fiscal year 2025, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans. \n\n\n \n \n39 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. \n \nIn December 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the implementation of a new worldwide ERP system. The Company anticipates spending approximately $130 million on the ERP implementation. The Company expects to use existing cash and its Credit Facility to fund the ERP implementation. For the first nine months of 2025, the Company has incurred $20 million of capitalized costs included in other assets and $14 million of operating costs included in the consolidated statement of operations for the ERP system implementation. \n \nIn accordance with the Merger Agreement, prior to, and as a condition of, the Distribution, SpinCo will make a cash payment to BD equal to $4.0 billion, subject to adjustment for cash, working capital and indebtedness of SpinCo and subject to decrease if additional shares of Company Common Stock will be issued to the Company’s shareholders. The SpinCo Cash Distribution is expected to be paid using proceeds from approximately $4.0 billion of new indebtedness to be incurred by SpinCo prior to the Distribution. The Company is expected to assume all indebtedness incurred by SpinCo in connection with the payment of the SpinCo Cash Distribution upon completion of the Merger. \n \nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company and certain financial institutions executed a 364-day bridge facility commitment letter, pursuant to which such financial institutions have committed to provide bridge financing of $1.8 billion to fund dividends, fees and expenses related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on the terms and conditions set forth therein. The bridge facility is expected to be replaced with permanent financing, which may include a delayed draw term loan facility. Based on information available through the date of this report, if the Merger closes, the Company estimates it will incur transaction-related expenses and financing fees of approximately $140 million in total. \n \nThe Merger Agreement also contains specified termination rights for the Company and BD, including a right allowing the Company or BD to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been consummated on or prior to July 13, 2026 (which date may be extended to October 13, 2026 in the event that required regulatory approvals have not been received). Additionally, the Merger Agreement requires the Company to pay BD a termination fee of $733 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances. \n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \nIn the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2025, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 27, 2025. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the nine months ended September 27, 2025. \n \nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n \nPlease refer to Note 13, Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments, in the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \n \nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the information incorporated by reference herein, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
