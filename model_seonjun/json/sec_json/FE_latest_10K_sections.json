MP has 1,040 employees and serves an area with a population of approximately 0.8 million. MP is contractually obligated to provide power to PE to meet its load obligations in West Virginia. MP owns or contractually controls 3,604 MWs of net maximum generation capacity that is supplied to its electric utility business, including 24 MWs of Solar generation and 487 MWs of pumped-storage hydroelectric generation from its 16.25% undivided interest in the Bath County facility in Virginia through its wholly-owned subsidiary AGC.\nRegulated Transmission Company Operating Subsidiaries\nFET, a holding company and parent of ATSI, MAIT, TrAIL, and PATH, is a VIE of FE, which holds 50.1% of its issued and outstanding membership interests. Brookfield owns the remaining 49.9% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of FET. Through its subsidiaries, FET owns and operates high-voltage transmission facilities in the PJM Region and has a rate base of $8.5 billion. FET's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC and applicable state regulatory authorities. FET and its subsidiaries have no direct employees. Each of these companies, however, relies on employees of their affiliates, including FESC, for the performance of necessary services. On January 1, 2024, PN and ME contributed their respective Class B equity interests of MAIT to FE, which were ultimately contributed to FET in exchange for a special purpose membership interest in FET. \n1\nSo long as FE holds the FET special purpose membership interests, it will receive 100% of any Class B distributions made by MAIT.\nOn July 26, 2024, FE, VEPCO and Transource Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of AEP, entered into a joint proposal agreement in connection with PJM’s 2024 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan Open Window 1 process. Pursuant to such joint proposal agreement, FET, VEPCO and Transource Energy, LLC jointly proposed certain regional electric transmission projects for PJM's consideration during the Open Window process. On November 25, 2024, FET, Dominion High Voltage MidAtlantic, Inc., as affiliate of VEPCO, and Transource Energy, LLC, formed Valley Link, which is the holding company responsible for managing and executing any projects awarded by PJM, and entered into a limited liability agreement. On February 26, 2025, PJM selected certain of the joint proposed projects, which included approximately $3 billion in investments for Valley Link to both build new and upgrade existing transmission infrastructure.\nATSI owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consist of 7,964 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 345 kV, 138 kV and 69 kV in Ohio and Pennsylvania and has a rate base of $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nMAIT owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consist of 4,287 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 500 kV, 345 kV, 230 kV, 138 kV, 115 kV, 69 kV and 46 kV in Pennsylvania, and has a rate base of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nTrAIL owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consists of 269 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 500 kV, 345 kV, 230 kV, 138 kV, including a 500 kV transmission line extending approximately 150 miles from southwestern Pennsylvania through West Virginia to a point of interconnection with VEPCO in northern Virginia, and has a rate base of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nPATH was a proposed transmission line from West Virginia through Virginia into Maryland which PJM cancelled in 2012. In March 2024, PATH completed the process of terminating all of its FERC-jurisdictional rates and facilities, with the result that PATH no longer is a “public utility” and no longer is subject to FERC jurisdiction. FET and its non-affiliated joint venture partner are completing the process of terminating the PATH corporate entities.\nKATCo owns high-voltage transmission facilities formerly owned by WP in PJM, which consist of 1,696 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 500 kV, 345 kV, 230 kV, 138 kV, and 115 kV in Pennsylvania, and has a rate base of $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2024. On January 1, 2024, WP transferred certain of its Pennsylvania-based transmission assets to KATCo. See Note 1, \"Organization and Basis of Presentation,\" for more information.\nService Company\nFESC has 5,166 employees and provides corporate support and other services, including executive administration, accounting and finance, risk management, human resources, corporate affairs, communications, information technology, legal services and other similar services at cost, in accordance with its cost allocation manual, to affiliated FirstEnergy companies under FESC agreements. \nSegments Overview\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, FirstEnergy’s segment reporting structure was modified to increase transparency for leadership and investors, simplify the presentation to corresponding legal entities, and align FirstEnergy’s earnings, cash flows and balance sheets at the business unit level. FirstEnergy’s reportable segments are as follows, and FirstEnergy continues to evaluate segment performance based on earnings attributable to FE from continuing operations: \n•\nDistribution Segment, which consists of the Ohio Companies and FE PA; \n•\nIntegrated Segment, which consists of MP, PE and JCP&L; and \n•\nStand-Alone Transmission Segment, which consists of FE's ownership in FET and KATCo.\nFE and its subsidiaries are principally involved in the transmission, distribution and generation of electricity through its reportable segments: Distribution, Integrated and Stand-Alone Transmission.\nThe \nDistribution\n segment, which consists of the Ohio Companies and FE PA, representing $11 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024, distributes electricity through FirstEnergy’s electric operating companies in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Distribution segment serves approximately 4.3 million customers in Ohio and Pennsylvania across its distribution footprint and purchases power for its provider of last resort, SOS, standard service offer and default service requirements. The segment’s results reflect the costs of securing and delivering electric generation to customers, including the deferral and amortization of certain costs.\nThe \nIntegrated\n segment includes the distribution and transmission operations under JCP&L, MP and PE, as well as MP’s regulated generation operations, representing $9.6 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024. The Integrated segment distributes electricity to approximately 2 million customers in New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland across its distribution footprint; provides transmission infrastructure in New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia to transmit electricity and \n2\noperates 3,604 MWs of regulated net maximum generation capacity located primarily in West Virginia and Virginia. The segment will also include MP and PE’s 50 MWs of solar generation at five sites in West Virginia once complete. The first two solar generation sites were completed and placed in service in January and September 2024, representing 24 MWs of net maximum generating capacity. The remaining three sites, once completed, are expected to provide 26 MWs of additional net maximum generation capacity.\nThe\n Stand-Alone Transmission\n segment, which consists of FE's ownership in FET and KATCo, representing $5.3 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024, includes transmission infrastructure owned and operated by the Transmission Companies and used to transmit electricity. The segment’s revenues are primarily derived from forward-looking formula rates, pursuant to which the revenue requirement is updated annually based on a projected rate base and projected costs, which is subject to an annual true-up based on actual rate base and costs. The segment’s results also reflect the net transmission expenses related to the delivery of electricity on FirstEnergy’s transmission facilities. KATCo, which was a subsidiary of FET, became a wholly owned subsidiary of FE prior to the closing of the FET P&SA I and remains in the Stand-Alone Transmission segment. On January 1, 2024, WP transferred certain of its Pennsylvania-based transmission assets to KATCo and prior year results in the Stand-Alone Transmission segment reflect the earnings and results of those WP transmission assets.\nCorporate/Other\n reflects corporate support and other costs not charged or attributable to the Electric Companies or Transmission Companies, including FE’s retained pension and OPEB assets and liabilities of former subsidiaries, interest expense on FE’s holding company debt and other investments or businesses that do not constitute an operating segment, including FEV’s investment of 33-1/3% equity ownership in Global Holding. Also included in Corporate/Other for segment reporting is 67 MWs of net maximum generation capacity, representing AE Supply’s OVEC capacity entitlement. As of December 31, 2024, Corporate/Other had approximately $6.1 billion of external FE holding company debt. \nRegulatory Accounting \nFirstEnergy accounts for the effects of regulation through the application of regulatory accounting to the Electric Companies and the Transmission Companies as their rates are established by third-party regulators with the authority to set binding rates that are cost-based and can be charged to and collected from customers.\nThe Electric Companies and the Transmission Companies recognize, as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, costs that FERC and the various state utility commissions, as applicable, have authorized for recovery from or return to customers in future periods or for which authorization is probable. Without the probability of such authorization, costs currently recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would have been charged or credited to income as incurred. All regulatory assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered from or returned to customers. Based on current ratemaking procedures, the Electric Companies and the Transmission Companies continue to collect cost-based rates for their distribution and transmission services; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Electric Companies and the Transmission Companies continue the application of regulatory accounting to those operations. Regulatory accounting is applied only to the parts of the business that meet the above criteria. If a portion of the business applying regulatory accounting no longer meets those requirements, previously recorded regulatory assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP.\nState Regulation and Federal Regulation\nThe following table summarizes the allowed ROE and the aggregate actual ROE of the Electric Companies and Transmission Companies as determined for regulatory purposes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nSegment\nEntity/State\nAllowed ROE\nActual ROE\nStand-Alone Transmission\nFET\n9.88%\n(1)\n - 12.7%\n10.4%\n(2)\nKATCo\n9.6%\n10.45%\nIntegrated\nMaryland\n9.5% - Distribution\n10.45% - Transmission\n8.3%\nNew Jersey\n9.6% - Distribution\n10.2% - Transmission\n9.3%\nWest Virginia\n9.8%\n8.4%\nDistribution\nOhio\n10.8%\n(3)\n4.7%\n(3)\nPennsylvania\nSettled\n(4)\n9.0%\n(1) \nReflects a 0.5% reduction to ATSI's 10.38% approved ROE due to the January 2025 Sixth Circuit ruling eliminating the 50 basis point adder associated with RTO membership (see Transmission ROE Incentive: OCC v. ATSI, et al. below)\n(2)\n FET ROE is a weighted average allowed ROE of ATSI, MAIT and TrAIL\n(3) \nAs filed on July 31, 2024, in pending base rate case before revenue adjustment\n(4)\n Commission-approved settlement agreement did not disclose ROE\n3\nSee \"Outlook - State Regulation\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information and discussion.\nSee \"Outlook - FERC Regulatory Matters\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information and discussion.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee \"Outlook - Environmental Matters\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information and discussion.\nCapital Requirements\nFirstEnergy’s business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction and other investment expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and interest payments, dividend payments and potential contributions to its pension plan. See \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information and discussion.\nSupply Plan\nSupply Chain\nEconomic conditions have stabilized across numerous material categories, but not all lead times have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Several key suppliers have seen improvements with capacity, but FirstEnergy continues to monitor the situation as demand increases across the industry, including due to data center usage. Inflationary pressures have moderated, which has improved the cost of materials, but certain categories have remained elevated. FirstEnergy continues to implement mitigation strategies to address supply constraints and does not expect any corresponding service disruptions or any material impact on its capital investment plan. However, the situation remains fluid and a prolonged continuation or further increase in demand, or the continuation of uncertain or adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures and new or increased existing tariffs, could lead to an increase in supply chain disruptions that could, in turn, have an adverse effect on FirstEnergy’s results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nIn February 2025, the new U.S. presidential administration announced the imposition of widespread and substantial tariffs on imports, with plans for additional tariffs to potentially be adopted in the future. Although certain of these tariffs were subsequently temporarily stayed, the situation is dynamic and subject to rapid change. The imposition of these or any other new or increased tariffs or resultant trade wars could have an adverse effect on FirstEnergy's results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nDefault Service\nCertain of the Electric Companies have default service obligations to provide power to non-shopping customers who have elected to continue to receive service under regulated retail tariffs. These default service plans vary by state and service territory, and volume of sales can vary depending on the level of shopping that occurs. JCP&L’s default service, or BGS supply, is secured through a statewide competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. Default service for the Ohio Companies, FE PA and PE's Maryland jurisdiction are provided through a competitive procurement process approved by the PUCO (under the current ESP), PPUC (under the Default Service Plan) and MDPSC (under the SOS), respectively. If any supplier fails to deliver power to any one of those Electric Companies’ service areas, the Utility serving that area may need to procure the required power in the market in their role as the default load serving entity. West Virginia electric generation continues to be regulated by the WVPSC.\nFuel Supply\nMP has coal contracts with various terms to purchase approximately 3 million tons of coal for the year 2025, which, along with its 2024 year-end inventory levels, accounts for approximately 80% of its forecasted 2025 coal requirements. MP has the ability to acquire additional tonnage through options available in its current contracts, as well as purchases through the spot market. The contracts expire at various times through 2027. This contracted coal is produced primarily from mines located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In order to meet emission requirements, MP holds contracts for a variety of reagents expiring at various times through 2026, as well as the ability to purchase additional reagents through the spot market. Additionally, MP is granted emission allowances by the EPA and purchases additional allowances as needed to meet emission requirements. See \"Outlook - Environmental Matters\" in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information pertaining to the impact of increased environmental regulations on fuel supply.\n4\nSystem Demand\nThe maximum hourly demand in 2024, 2023 and 2022 for each of the Electric Companies was:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nSystem Demand\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In MWs)\nCEI\n3,971 \n3,868 \n4,266 \nFE PA\n1\n10,404 \n10,058 \n10,255 \nJCP&L\n6,184 \n5,731 \n6,122 \nMP\n2,096 \n2,051 \n2,124 \nOE\n5,582 \n5,192 \n5,652 \nPE\n3,860 \n3,103 \n3,514 \nTE\n2,074 \n2,220 \n2,277 \n(1)\n On January 1, 2024, FirstEnergy consolidated the Pennsylvania Companies into FE PA, making it a new, single operating entity. \nRegional Reliability\nAll of FirstEnergy's facilities are located within the PJM Region and operate under the reliability oversight of a regional entity known as RFC. This regional entity operates under the oversight of NERC in accordance with a delegation agreement approved by FERC.\nCompetition\nWithin FirstEnergy’s Electric Companies' distribution business, there generally is no competition for electric distribution service in the Electric Companies’ respective service territories in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Additionally, pursuant to FERC’s Order No. 1000 and subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals, non-incumbent developers can compete for certain PJM transmission projects in the service territories of certain of FirstEnergy’s Electric Companies' providing transmission services and the Transmission Companies. This has resulted in additional competition to build transmission facilities in the respective service territories while also allowing the opportunity to seek to build facilities in non-incumbent service territories.\nSeasonality\nThe sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business, and weather patterns can have, and have in the past had, a material impact on FirstEnergy’s Electric Companies' operating results. Demand for electricity in our service territories historically peaks during the summer and winter months. Accordingly, FirstEnergy’s annual results of operations and liquidity position may depend disproportionately on its operating performance during the summer and winter. Mild weather conditions may result in lower power sales, and consequently, lower revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nHuman Capital\nFirstEnergy focuses on a number of human capital resources, measures and objectives in managing its business, including through striving to achieve its core values.\nFirstEnergy believes that creating a sense of belonging among our employees positions the company to deliver better service to customers, strengthen operational performance, and help create a work environment where employees feel valued and respected. FirstEnergy remains focused advancing a culture of belonging for employees.\nDuring 2024, FirstEnergy continued to promote these values by:\n•\nSponsoring a council of select senior management and other leaders and influential employees across the company, who work together to promote our core values throughout the workforce;\n•\nSharing the results of our most recent employee engagement survey designed to capture our employees’ perspectives on their work experience and progress toward embracing a more welcoming culture; and\n•\nSupporting multiple employee business resource groups, known as \"EBRGs,\" to further support our values through networking, mentoring, coaching, recruiting, development and community outreach. There are currently 9 EBRGs across 21 chapters, which are open to all employees.\n5\nSafety \nSafety is an unwavering core value of FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy employees have the power and responsibility to keep each other safe and eliminate life-changing events, which are injuries that have life-changing impacts or fatal results. Safety metrics, such as injuries that result in days away or restricted time and life-changing events, are regularly monitored, internally reported, and included in FirstEnergy’s annual incentive compensation program to reinforce that a safe work environment is crucial to FirstEnergy’s success. \nFirstEnergy continues to focus on mitigating life-changing event exposure to strengthen FirstEnergy’s safety-first culture and drive safer decisions from an engaged workforce who puts safety first. FirstEnergy continues to embed its \"Leading with Safety\" learnings where leaders and employees receive safety training and reinforcement of exposure control concepts that are designed to improve job site exposure identification, communication and mitigation to ultimately prevent life changing events. \nEmployee Development\nFirstEnergy’s employees are empowered to take ownership of their careers with increased transparency into FirstEnergy’s internal and external hiring process and availability of tools and processes that support career management, talent reviews, succession planning and leadership selection. FirstEnergy is committed to preparing its high-performing workforce for the future and helping employees reach their full potential, which includes developing employee skills and competencies and preparing aspiring, emerging and experienced leaders for future leadership responsibilities.\nUnderstanding FirstEnergy’s rapidly changing industry and strategy is key to its employees’ ability to support FirstEnergy’s mission and meet its customers’ evolving needs. Key FirstEnergy development programs include: \n•\nTalent management\n, which includes a commitment to transparency in career management and development opportunities, consistent with FirstEnergy’s core values;\n•\nA \nmentoring program \nthat gives employees the opportunity to select a mentor from within the organization to promote enhanced learning, teamwork and collaboration;\n•\nLeadership development opportunities \nthat include training for new supervisors and managers, experienced leader programming and coaching, aspiring leader programs that build leadership capabilities for employees who are ready near-term leadership roles; and external partnership with the Center for Creative Leadership\n®\n and BeingFirst\n®\n for senior and executive leadership development;\n•\nEducational opportunities\n through FirstEnergy’s \"Educate to Elevate\" program, which provides access to post-secondary education and a path to both associate’s and bachelor’s degrees for employees; and\n•\nWorkforce development programs\n that include an apprentice line worker program designed to attract technical entry-level talent to FirstEnergy.\nCompensation and Benefits\nFirstEnergy’s total rewards program is designed to attract, motivate, retain and reward employees for their role in the success of FirstEnergy. The base pay program is designed to balance an employee’s value to FirstEnergy in a manner that is commensurate with comparable jobs at peer companies. FirstEnergy aims to ensure that its internal policies and processes support pay equity.\nThe annual incentive compensation program is designed to align compensation with the achievement of near-term corporate and business unit objectives, as well as outstanding individual performance. Additionally, FirstEnergy’s long-term incentive compensation program is designed to reward eligible leaders for FirstEnergy’s achievement of longer-term goals intended to drive shareholder value and growth. In addition to base pay and incentive compensation plans, FirstEnergy offers a comprehensive benefits program, including healthcare, dental, prescription, vision, a 401(k) savings plan and a defined benefit pension plan to eligible employees. \n6\nEmployees and Collective Bargaining Agreements \nAs of December 31, 2024, FirstEnergy had 12,294 employees, all of whom were located in the United States as follows:\nTotal\nEmployees\nBargaining\nUnit\nEmployees\nFESC\n5,166 \n521 \nCEI\n819 \n570 \nFE PA\n2,083 \n1,536 \nJCP&L\n1,296 \n992 \nMP\n1,040 \n396 \nOE\n1,061 \n666 \nPE\n505 \n246 \nTE\n324 \n249 \nTotal\n12,294\n \n5,176\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the IBEW, the UWUA and the OPEIU unions collectively represented approximately 40% of FirstEnergy’s employees. There are currently 15 collective bargaining agreements between FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries and its unions, which have multi-year contracts. In 2024, FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries reached new collective bargaining agreements with IBEW Local 1289, IBEW Local 459 and OPEIU 792. One collective bargaining agreement was set to expire in 2025, with a settlement reached in January 2025, representing approximately 3% of FirstEnergy’s employees.\n7\nInformation About Our Executive Officers (as of February 27, 2025) \nName\nAge\nPositions Held During Past Five Years\nDates\nBrian X.

Its electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving over six million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York. FirstEnergy’s transmission subsidiaries operate more than 24,000 miles of transmission lines that connect the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions and two regional transmission operation centers. As of December 31, 2024, AGC and MP control 3,604 MWs of net maximum generation capacity. \nSegment Overview\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, FirstEnergy’s segment reporting structure was modified to increase transparency for leadership and investors, simplify the presentation to corresponding legal entities, and align FirstEnergy’s earnings, cash flows and balance sheets at the business unit level. FirstEnergy’s reportable segments are as follows:\nThe \nDistribution\n segment, which consists of the Ohio Companies and FE PA, representing $11 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024, distributes electricity through FirstEnergy’s electric operating companies in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Distribution segment serves approximately 4.3 million customers in Ohio and Pennsylvania across its distribution footprint and purchases power for its provider of last resort, SOS, standard service offer and default service requirements. The segment’s results reflect the costs of securing and delivering electric generation to customers, including the deferral and amortization of certain costs.\nThe \nIntegrated\n segment includes the distribution and transmission operations under JCP&L, MP and PE, as well as MP’s regulated generation operations, representing $9.6 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024. The Integrated segment distributes electricity to approximately 2 million customers in New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland across its distribution footprint; provides transmission infrastructure in New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia to transmit electricity and operates 3,604 MWs of regulated net maximum generation capacity located primarily in West Virginia and Virginia. The segment will also include MP and PE’s 50 MWs of solar generation at five sites in West Virginia once complete. The first two solar generation sites were completed and placed in service in January and September 2024, representing 24 MWs of net maximum generating capacity. The remaining three sites, once completed, are expected to provide 26 MWs of additional net maximum generation capacity.\nThe\n Stand-Alone Transmission\n segment, which consists of FE's ownership in FET and KATCo, representing $5.3 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024, includes transmission infrastructure owned and operated by the Transmission Companies and used to transmit electricity. The segment’s revenues are primarily derived from forward-looking formula rates, pursuant to which the revenue requirement is updated annually based on a projected rate base and projected costs, which is subject to an annual true-up based on actual rate base and costs. The segment’s results also reflect the net transmission expenses related to the delivery of electricity on FirstEnergy’s transmission facilities. KATCo, which was a subsidiary of FET, became a wholly owned subsidiary of FE prior to the closing of the FET P&SA I and remains in the Stand-Alone Transmission segment. On January 1, 2024, WP transferred certain of its Pennsylvania-based transmission assets to KATCo and prior year results in the Stand-Alone Transmission segment reflect the earnings and results of those WP transmission assets.\nCorporate/Other\n reflects corporate support and other costs not charged or attributable to the Electric Companies or Transmission Companies, including FE’s retained pension and OPEB assets and liabilities of former subsidiaries, interest expense on FE’s holding company debt and other investments or businesses that do not constitute an operating segment, including FEV’s investment of 33-1/3% equity ownership in Global Holding. Also included in Corporate/Other for segment reporting is 67 MWs of net maximum generation capacity, representing AE Supply’s OVEC capacity entitlement. As of December 31, 2024, Corporate/Other had approximately $6.1 billion of external FE holding company debt. \nFirstEnergy believes that this segment reporting serves to provide: \n•\nGreater transparency into our business unit performance;\n•\nAlignment with our cash flow, credit metrics, balance sheet and earnings to the companies comprising each segment;\n•\nSimplification of our segment reporting so that each entire entity resides within a segment; and\n•\nConsistency with peers.\n32\nPA Consolidation \nOn January 1, 2024, FirstEnergy consolidated the Pennsylvania Companies into FE PA, rendering FE PA a new, single operating entity and the successor-in-interest to all assets and liabilities of the Pennsylvania Companies. As of January 1, 2024, FE PA is FE’s only regulated distribution power company in Pennsylvania encompassing the operations previously conducted individually by the Pennsylvania Companies. FirstEnergy continues to evaluate the legal, financial, operational and branding benefits of consolidating the Ohio Companies into a single Ohio power company.\nAlso on January 1, 2024, WP transferred certain of its Pennsylvania-based transmission assets to KATCo, and PN and ME contributed their respective Class B equity interests of MAIT to FE, which were ultimately contributed to FET in exchange for a special purpose membership interest in FET. So long as FE holds the FET special purpose membership interests, it will receive 100% of any Class B distributions made by MAIT.\nFET Equity Interest Sale\nOn February 2, 2023, FE, along with FET, entered into the FET P&SA II with Brookfield and the Brookfield Guarantors, pursuant to which FE agreed to sell to Brookfield at the closing, and Brookfield agreed to purchase from FE, an incremental 30% equity interest in FET for a purchase price of $3.5 billion. The FET Equity Interest Sale closed on March 25, 2024 and FET continues to be consolidated in FirstEnergy’s financial statements. The purchase price was paid in part by the issuance of two promissory notes at closing having an aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion with: (i) one promissory note having an aggregate principal amount of $750 million, at an interest rate of 5.75% per annum, with a maturity date of September 25, 2025 and (ii) one promissory note having an aggregate principal amount of $450 million, at an interest rate of 7.75% per annum, with a maturity date of December 31, 2024. The remaining $2.3 billion of the purchase price was paid in cash at closing. On July 17, 2024, Brookfield paid FE approximately $1.2 billion in full satisfaction of the promissory notes. Interest income associated with the promissory notes was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and is reported within “Miscellaneous income, net” on FirstEnergy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result of the consummation of the transaction, Brookfield’s interest in FET increased from 19.9% to 49.9%, while FE retained the remaining 50.1% ownership interests of FET.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOn May 8, 2024, the EPA finalized changes to the CCR regulations addressing inactive surface impoundments at inactive electric utilities, known as legacy CCR surface impoundments, and in November 2024 and January 2025, the EPA made several technical corrections to the rule. The rule extends 2015 CCR rule requirements for groundwater monitoring and protection procedures, operational and reporting procedures, as well as closure requirements for impoundments and landfills that were not originally included for coverage by the 2015 CCR rule. In anticipation of such expenditures, FirstEnergy performed a preliminary assessment of former CCR disposal sites and calculated an initial estimate applying historical experience in remediating comparable sites. As a result, FirstEnergy recorded a $139 million increase to its ARO during 2024, of which $113 million is included in “Other operating expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Income and was not capitalized as an asset retirement cost since the associated plants do not have future cash flows. \nOn November 30, 2020, AE Supply submitted a closure deadline extension request to the EPA seeking to extend the cease accepting waste date for the McElroy's Run CCR impoundment facility to October 2024, which request was withdrawn by AE Supply on July 9, 2024, prior to the completion of the technical review by the EPA. As of May 31, 2024, AE Supply ceased accepting waste at the McElroy’s Run CCR impoundment facility from Pleasants Power Station. As of December 31, 2024, AE Supply continues to operate the dry landfill adjacent to McElroy’s Run as a disposal facility for Pleasants Power Station. During the second quarter of 2024, as a result of the evaluation of closure options for McElroy’s Run and the adjacent landfill, AE Supply reviewed its ARO and future expected costs to remediate, resulting in an increase to the ARO liability and corresponding increase to “Other operating expense” of $87 million at Corporate/Other for segment reporting. On February 3, 2025, AE Supply executed an environmental liability transfer agreement with a subsidiary of IDA Power, LLC, whereby AE Supply will transfer the McElroy’s Run CCR impoundment facility and adjacent dry landfill and related remediation obligations. The agreement requires AE Supply to establish a $160 million escrow account that AE Supply will fund over five years. The escrow funding obligation will be secured by a surety bond, which will be guaranteed by FE. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the first quarter of 2025 and the derecognition of the ARO is not expected to have a material impact to FirstEnergy’s financial statements, however, no assurances of the closing of the transfer will be satisfied, including transfer of all required environmental permits. See Note 10, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n33\nOur Strategy\nPowered by its employees and guided by its experienced leadership team and engaged FE Board, FirstEnergy is accelerating its transformation into a premier electric company. The FE Board and FirstEnergy’s executive management team are aligned behind a business model grounded in investing, operating, recovering costs and financing our regulated electric company operations. This business model aims to create a “virtuous cycle” that, in turn, serves to improve reliability and the customer experience, grow rate base, engage employees, improve returns and maintain a strong balance sheet. Along with an unwavering commitment to ethics and integrity, performance excellence and continuous improvement, FirstEnergy anticipates that strong execution of this model will help achieve its strategic objectives and deliver value to its investors.\nWith a diversified asset mix, improved balance sheet and a strong affordability position, FirstEnergy is well positioned to significantly enhance the customer experience and provide value to its investors. \nInvest\nFirstEnergy invests in its regulated operations to improve reliability and the customer experience, and in its people to attract, retain and develop talented, diverse and engaged employees to carry out its strategy. This includes the following:\n•\nA robust plan for customer-focused growth, Energize365 is the centerpiece of FirstEnergy’s regulated distribution and transmission capital investment strategy that aims to strengthen the grid and enable the energy transition. Through the Energize365 program, FirstEnergy invested $4.5 billion in 2024, approximately 20% higher than 2023, and expects to spend approximately $28 billion in system-wide capital investments from 2025 through 2029. FirstEnergy expects that these investments will comprise the Distribution segment (26%), the Integrated segment (39%), and the Stand-Alone Transmission segment (34%), focusing on the following:\n•\nDistribution and Transmission investments to support improvements in grid reliability and resiliency and support the energy transition, including through:\n◦\nPrograms to drive system resiliency through automation technology and communication, including phases one and two of the Ohio Companies’ distribution grid modernization plans, Pennsylvania's LTIIP, New Jersey's EnergizeNJ, and implementing advanced metering infrastructure;\n◦\nOperational flexibility projects that are expected to build capacity and support the evolving grid such as interconnection of New Jersey offshore wind and data center load;\n◦\nEnhancing system performance by implementing new designs and technologies to reduce load at risk; and\n◦\nUpgrading system conditions that enhance reliability.\n•\nWest Virginia solar generation projects, energy efficiency initiatives, electric vehicle infrastructure and energy storage projects.\n•\nBase distribution projects to address aging infrastructure.\n•\nGeneration maintenance projects that maintain operations of fossil fuel plants and remain compliant with environmental regulations through the end of their useful life.\n•\nFirstEnergy believes there is a continued long-term pipeline of investment opportunities for its existing distribution and transmission infrastructure beyond those opportunities identified through 2029, which are expected to strengthen grid \n34\nand cyber security and make the transmission system more reliable, robust, secure and resistant to extreme weather events, with improved operational flexibility. \n•\nOn July 26, 2024, FE, VEPCO and Transource Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of AEP, entered into a joint proposal agreement in connection with PJM’s 2024 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan Open Window 1 process. Pursuant to such joint proposal agreement, FET, VEPCO and Transource Energy, LLC jointly proposed certain regional electric transmission projects for PJM's consideration during the Open Window process. On November 25, 2024, FET, Dominion High Voltage MidAtlantic, Inc., as affiliate of VEPCO, and Transource Energy, LLC, formed Valley Link, which is the holding company responsible for managing and executing any projects awarded by PJM, and entered into a limited liability agreement. On February 26, 2025, PJM selected certain of the joint proposed projects, which included approximately $3 billion in investments for Valley Link to both build new and upgrade existing transmission infrastructure.\n•\nA refreshed and revitalized leadership team. During 2024, FirstEnergy appointed five executives to oversee the Maryland/West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Transmission operations. Additionally, FirstEnergy also announced the hiring of five vice presidents that will be responsible for developing and implementing the financial strategy and oversee relationships with regulators for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and Transmission.\nOperate\n \nFirstEnergy will continue to engage its skilled, trained, talented and diverse team of employees to effectively implement its investment plans, seek opportunities for continuous improvement as it delivers safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our customers, and deliver value to its investors. It aims to do so through the following:\n•\nEnhancing the focus on the customer.\n FirstEnergy has shifted more decision-making and accountability for our operations closer to our customers, regulators and employees doing the work. FirstEnergy’s new operating structure is organized as follows: Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia/Maryland and FirstEnergy’s Standalone Transmission properties. This structure fosters better execution at the business unit level.\n•\nEmbracing a continuous improvement mindset.\n FirstEnergy is focused on operational excellence through strong execution of our capital investments to enhance the customer experience and support the energy transition, managing costs and keeping customer bills affordable and reducing regulatory lag.\nRecover \nFirstEnergy is establishing a track record of strong execution. Operating effectively leads to strong, predictable results and enhances credibility with our stakeholders. In turn, FirstEnergy builds supportive relationships with regulators, customers and intervenors in an effort to drive positive rate outcomes that support recovery of its investments.\nIn order to achieve important regulatory milestones, FirstEnergy has an active regulatory calendar to support its regulated growth strategy and address the critical investments that support reliability and a smarter electric grid. This includes the following:\nNew Jersey\n•\nOn March 16, 2023, JCP&L filed a base rate case in New Jersey, requesting a $185 million increase in base distribution revenues to support investments to strengthen the energy grid, enhance the customer experience and provide assistance to low-income and senior citizen customers. On February 1, 2024, JCP&L, joined by various parties, filed a stipulated settlement with the NJBPU resolving JCP&L’s request for a distribution base rate increase. The settlement, which was approved by the NJBPU on February 14, 2024, provides for an $85 million annual base distribution revenue increase for JCP&L, which became effective for customers on June 1, 2024.\n•\nOn November 9, 2023, JCP&L filed a petition for approval of its EnergizeNJ with the NJBPU that would, among other things, support grid modernization, system resiliency and substation modernization in technologies designed to provide enhanced customer benefits. On February 14, 2024, the NJBPU approved the stipulated settlement between JCP&L and various parties, resolving JCP&L’s request for a distribution base rate increase. On February 27, 2024, as part of the stipulated settlement, JCP&L amended its pending EnergizeNJ petition following receipt of NJBPU approval of the base rate case settlement, to remove the high-priority circuits that are to be addressed in the first phase of its reliability improvement plan and to include the second phase of its reliability improvement plan that is expected to further address certain high-priority circuits that require additional upgrades. EnergizeNJ, if approved as amended, will result in the investment of approximately $930.5 million of total estimated costs over five years. JCP&L and various parties are engaged in settlement discussions with respect to the pending EnergizeNJ petition.\n•\nOn December 1, 2023, JCP&L filed a petition with the NJBPU requesting approval of its EE&C Plan II, which covers the January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2027 period and had a proposed budget of approximately $964 million. On October \n35\n30, 2024, the NJBPU approved the parties’ stipulation of settlement, wherein the parties agreed to a budget of approximately $817 million for EE&C Plan II, including $784 million of investments that will earn a return on equity of 9.6%, with an equity ratio of 52%, and will be recovered over 10 years.\nOhio\n•\nOn April 5, 2023, the Ohio Companies sought approval from the PUCO for their ESP V. The proposed plan would maintain an eight-year term beginning June 1, 2024, and continue riders recovering costs associated with distribution infrastructure investments and approved grid modernization investments. ESP V additionally proposed new riders that would support reliability, and included provisions supporting affordability and enhancing the customer experience. On May 15, 2024, the PUCO issued an order approving ESP V with modifications, which are described below in “Outlook - State Regulation - Ohio”. On June 14, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed an Application for Rehearing, which was denied by operation of law as the PUCO did not rule on the applications for rehearing within 30 days of filing. Due to the risks and uncertainty resulting from the Ohio Companies’ application for rehearing being denied by operation of law, on October 29, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed a notice of their intent to withdraw ESP V and proposed the terms under which they would resume operating under ESP IV, which was approved by the PUCO on December 18, 2024. On January 22, 2025, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies’ ESP IV compliance tariffs with an effective date of February 1, 2025, at which point the Ohio Companies resumed operating under ESP IV with modifications, as described below in “Outlook - State Regulation - Ohio”. \n•\nOn January 31, 2025, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO for ESP VI, which would begin concurrently with the effective date of any new base distribution rates resulting from the Ohio Companies’ pending base rate case and continue through May 31, 2028. ESP VI proposes to continue existing riders to support continued maintenance of the distribution system, and to reestablish riders to recover vegetation management and storm restoration expenses. ESP VI also includes provisions supporting affordability and enhancing the customer experience. The PUCO has scheduled a technical conference for March 12, 2025.\n•\nOn April 12, 2024, the Ohio Companies and certain of the parties filed a stipulation that modified the Ohio Companies’ application for phase two of its grid modernization plan, which was approved by the PUCO on December 18, 2024. The stipulation provides for the deployment of approximately 1.4 million smart meters to the balance of the Ohio Companies’ customers. Phase two of the distribution grid modernization plan, as modified by the stipulation would be completed over a four-year budget period with estimated capital investments of approximately $421 million. On December 18, 2024, the PUCO approved the stipulation and implementation has since begun.\n•\nOn May 31, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed their application for an increase in base distribution rates, based on a 2024 calendar year test period. The Ohio Companies requested a net increase in base distribution revenues of approximately $94 million with a return on equity of 10.8% and capital structures of 44% debt and 56% equity for CEI, 46% debt and 54% equity for OE, and 45% debt and 55% equity for TE, which reflects a roll-in of current riders such as DCR and AMI. The net increase represented a 1.5% average residential monthly bill increase. Key components of the base rate case filing include a proposal to change pension and OPEB recovery to the delayed recognition method and to implement a mechanism to establish a regulatory asset (or liability) to recover (or refund) net differences between the amount of pension and OPEB expense requested in the proceeding and the actual amount each year using this method. Additionally, the Ohio Companies requested recovery of certain incurred costs, including the impact of major storms, a program to convert streetlights to LEDs, and others. On June 14, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed supporting testimony and on July 31, 2024, filed an update with an adjusted net increase of base distribution revenues of approximately $190 million and to incorporate matters in the rate case as directed by the PUCO’s ESP V order. On December 18, 2024, the PUCO issued an order approving the Ohio Companies’ withdrawal of ESP V. On January 22, 2025, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies’ revised ESP IV tariffs, effective February 1, 2025, at which time the Ohio Companies resumed operating under ESP IV. On January 27, 2025, the Ohio Companies notified the PUCO of their intention to update their application for an increase in base distribution rates to remove ESP V related provisions from the base rate case. The PUCO staff hired a third party auditor to assist in the review of the Ohio Companies’ base rate case filing and on February 21, 2025, PUCO staff and the third party auditor each filed their reports. The auditor’s report recommended adjustments which would result in a net increase of the Ohio Companies’ base distribution revenues of approximately $8 million with a return on equity of 9.63% and capital structures of 48.8% debt and 51.2% equity for each of the Ohio Companies. PUCO staff’s report takes limited positions on the auditor’s finding and recommendations and makes additional findings. The Ohio Companies plan to respond and file supplemental testimony by March 24, 2025.\nPennsylvania\n•\nOn April 2, 2024, FE PA filed a base rate case with the PPUC seeking a net increase in base distribution revenues of approximately $502 million with a return on equity of 11.3% and capital structure of 46.2% debt and 53.8% equity, and which reflects a roll-in of several current riders such as DSIC, Tax Act, and smart meter. Additionally, FE PA requested an enhanced ten year vegetation management program and recovery of certain incurred costs, including the impact of major storms, COVID-19, a program to convert streetlights to LEDs, and others. On September 13, 2024, FE PA and the active parties to the proceeding filed a joint settlement agreement requesting that the administrative law judges \n36\napprove FE PA’s requested distribution base rate case increase subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement, which includes, among other things, an annual net revenue increase of $225 million. Other key components of the settlement agreement include recovery of costs incurred for storms and COVID-19, additional cost recovery of ongoing storm costs, inspection and maintenance of overhead lines and transformers, and rate case expenses, as well as an enhanced vegetation management program. On October 15, 2024, the administrative law judges issued a decision recommending that the PPUC approve, without modification, the September 13, 2024 settlement agreement. On November 21, 2024, the PPUC unanimously approved the settlement agreement without modification and the rates became effective on January 1, 2025.\n•\nOn July 22, 2024, FE PA filed its application with the PPUC seeking approval for the next phase of its LTIIP program, which is expected to result in approximately $1.6 billion in investments, with approximately $1.4 billion of such investments going in service during the five-year period beginning January 1, 2025 and ending December 31, 2029. FE PA’s application was approved by the PPUC on December 19, 2024, and implementation began in January 2025.\nWest Virginia\n•\nOn January 13, 2023, MP and PE filed a request with the WVPSC seeking approval of new depreciation rates for existing and future capital assets. On August 22, 2023, the parties filed a unanimous settlement of the case recommending a $33 million annual increase in depreciation expense, effective April 1, 2024, but deferred issues related to a change in the net energy metering credit. An order was issued on March 26, 2024 approving the settlement without modification.\n•\nOn January 23, 2024, MP, PE and various parties filed a joint settlement agreement with the WVPSC, which recommended a base rate increase of $105 million, inclusive of the $33 million increase in depreciation expense, but deferred issues related to a change in the net energy metering credit. Additionally, the settlement included a new low-income customer advocacy program, a pilot program for service reliability investments and recovery of costs related to storm restoration, retired generation assets and COVID-19. The settlement did not include the request to establish a regulatory asset (or liability) for recovery (or refund) associated with pension and OPEB expense, however, it did not preclude MP and PE from pursuing that in a future separate proceeding. An agreement on the net energy metering credit was subsequently submitted to the WVPSC and was materially approved as part of the base rate case order for rates effective March 27, 2024.\nFinance\nWe believe that FirstEnergy represents a compelling investment. With sound capital allocation targeting reliability, resiliency, the energy transition and customer experience, and supported by constructive regulatory outcomes, FirstEnergy expects to finance the business at a lower cost of capital, allowing it to begin the virtuous cycle all over again at “Invest.”\nFirstEnergy aims to do this through a strengthened financial position. Since 2021, FirstEnergy has raised $7 billion in equity capital and issued $1.5 billion in convertible notes in May 2023 to significantly improve its balance sheet. The strength of FirstEnergy’s balance sheet supports its plan to fund Energize365 investments through organic internal cash flows and the issuance of debt rather than incremental equity. FirstEnergy has optimized its financing plan to retain flexibility in an uncertain interest rate environment. FirstEnergy has also taken steps to reduce potential volatility risk associated with its pension plan. In January 2025, FirstEnergy executed an additional pension lift-out transaction associated with over $652 million in pension obligations relating to its former competitive generation employees. This lift-out transaction, combined with the lift-out completed in 2023, removed approximately $1.4 billion in total pension plan assets and obligations associated with approximately 3,900 former competitive generation employees.\nFirstEnergy also expects to continue returning value to shareholders. In March 2024, the FE Board declared a $0.015 per share increase to the quarterly common stock dividend payable June 1, 2024, to $0.425 per share, which represents an approximate 6% increase compared to dividends declared in 2023. Modest dividend growth is expected to enable enhanced shareholder returns, while still allowing for continued substantial regulated investments. Dividend payments are subject to declaration by the FE Board, and future dividend decisions determined by the FE Board may be impacted by earnings growth, credit metrics and other business conditions.\nHB 6 and Related Investigations\nOn July 21, 2021, FE entered into a three-year DPA with the U.S. Attorney’s Office that, subject to court proceedings, resolves the U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation into FirstEnergy relating to FirstEnergy’s lobbying and governmental affairs activities concerning HB 6 related to the federal criminal allegations made in July 2020, against former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and other individuals and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Householder. Among other things under the DPA, FE paid a $230 million monetary penalty in 2021 and agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging FE with one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. The $230 million payment will neither be recovered in rates or charged to FirstEnergy customers, nor will FirstEnergy seek any tax deduction related to such payment. As of July 22, 2024, FirstEnergy had successfully completed the obligations required within the three-year term of the DPA. Under the DPA, FirstEnergy has an \n37\nobligation to continue (i) publishing quarterly a list of all payments to 501(c)(4) entities and all payments to entities known by FirstEnergy operating for the benefit of a public official, either directly or indirectly; (ii) not making any statements that contradict the DPA; (iii) notifying the U.S. Attorney’s Office of any changes in FirstEnergy’s corporate form; and (iv) cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s Office until the conclusion of any related investigation, criminal prosecution, and civil proceeding brought by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, including the January 17, 2025, indictment against two former FirstEnergy senior officers, as described below in “Outlook -- Other Legal Proceedings - United States v. Larry Householder, et al.”. Within 30 days of those matters concluding, and FirstEnergy’s successful completion of its remaining obligations, the U.S. Attorney’s Office will dismiss the criminal information.\nOn February 9, 2022, FE, acting through the SLC, agreed to a settlement term sheet to resolve multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits that were filed in the S.D. Ohio, the N.D. Ohio, and the Ohio Court of Common Pleas, Summit County, each relating to the allegations against the now former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and other individuals and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Householder. On March 11, 2022, the parties executed a stipulation and agreement of settlement, and filed a motion the same day requesting preliminary settlement approval in the S.D. Ohio, which was granted on May 9, 2022. On August 23, 2022, the S.D. Ohio granted final approval of the settlement, which was subsequently appealed. On February 16, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s final settlement approval. All appeal options were exhausted on May 16, 2024, and the judgment and settlement became final, resolving the derivative lawsuits. On May 17, 2024, the N.D. Ohio granted the parties’ motion to dismiss based upon the approval of the settlement by the S.D. Ohio. The state court action was also dismissed on September 2, 2022.\nThe above settlement included a series of corporate governance enhancements and a payment to FE of $180 million, less approximately $36 million in court-ordered attorney’s fees awarded to plaintiffs, and a $7 million net return on deposited funds, which was received in the second quarter of 2024. The judgment and settlement are final and, therefore, the derivative lawsuits are now fully resolved. \nOn August 10, 2020, the SEC, through its Division of Enforcement, issued an order directing an investigation of possible securities laws violations by FE, and on September 1, 2020, issued subpoenas to FE and certain FE officers relating to the conduct described in the DPA. On April 28, 2021, July 11, 2022, and May 25, 2023, the SEC issued additional subpoenas to FE, with which FE has complied. FirstEnergy cooperated fully with the SEC investigation, and on September 12, 2024, the SEC issued a settlement order that concluded and resolved the investigation in its entirety. Under the terms of the settlement, FE agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100 million and to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of specified provisions of the federal securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder, which was recognized as a loss contingency of $100 million in the second quarter of 2024 at Corporate/Other for segment reporting and paid on September 25, 2024.\nOn June 29, 2023, the OOCIC served FE a subpoena, seeking information relating to the conduct described in the DPA. FirstEnergy was not aware of the OOCIC’s investigation prior to receiving the subpoena and understood that the OOCIC’s investigation was also focused on the conduct described in the DPA, other than with respect to the March 25, 2024, felony indictment of Mr. Householder brought in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. FirstEnergy is cooperating with the OOCIC in its investigation. On February 12, 2024, and in connection with the OOCIC’s ongoing investigation, an indictment by a grand jury of Summit County, Ohio was unsealed against the now-deceased, former chairman of the PUCO, and two former FirstEnergy senior officers, charging each of them with several felony counts, including bribery, telecommunications fraud, money laundering and aggravated theft, related to payments described in the DPA. On August 12, 2024, FirstEnergy entered into a settlement with the OAG's Office, and the Summit County Prosecutor’s Office to resolve both the OOCIC investigation and State of Ohio ex rel. Dave Yost, Ohio Attorney General v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al. and City of Cincinnati and City of Columbus v. FirstEnergy Corp., noted below. The settlement includes, among other things, a non-prosecution agreement and a payment of $19.5 million, which was recorded as a loss contingency in the second quarter of 2024 in FirstEnergy’s Consolidated Statements of Income at Corporate/Other for segment reporting and was paid on August 16, 2024.\nDespite the many disruptions FirstEnergy has faced, and continues to currently face, the leadership team remains committed and focused on executing its strategy and running the business. See “Outlook - Other Legal Proceedings” below for additional details on the government investigations, the DPA, and ongoing litigation surrounding the investigation of HB 6. See also “Outlook - State Regulation - Ohio” below for details on the PUCO proceeding reviewing political and charitable spending and legislative activity in response to the investigation of HB 6. The outcome of the government investigations, PUCO proceedings, legislative activity, and any of these lawsuits is uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n38\nFIRSTENERGY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2024 Compared with 2023\n(In millions)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nIncrease (Decrease)\nRevenues\n$\n13,472 \n$\n12,870 \n$\n602 \n5 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(11,097)\n(10,604)\n493 \n5 \n%\nOther expenses, net\n(871)\n(802)\n69 \n9 \n%\nIncome taxes\n(377)\n(267)\n110 \n41 \n%\nIncome attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(149)\n(74)\n75 \n101 \n%\nEarnings attributable to FE from continuing operations\n$\n978 \n$\n1,123 \n$\n(145)\n(13)\n%\nEarnings attributable to FE from continuing operations was $978 million or $1.70 per basic and diluted share in 2024 compared to $1,123 million or $1.96 per basic and diluted share in 2023, representing a decrease of $145 million that was primarily due to the following:\n•\nA $200 million charge relating to an increase in ARO liabilities associated with final CCR rules and changes in future expected costs to remediate McElroy’s Run during 2024;\n•\nA $100 million civil penalty resulting from the SEC investigation and a $19.5 million settlement with the OAG's office as further discussed below in “Outlook - Other Legal Proceedings”;\n•\nA $62 million impairment charge related to the Akron general office in the third quarter of 2024;\n•\nLower revenues associated with changes to the Ohio DCR as a result of the PUCO’s ESP V order that became effective June 1, 2024;\n•\nA $46 million charge for an expected refund, with interest, as a result of the Sixth Circuit ruling eliminating the 50 basis point adder associated with RTO membership, as further discussed below in \"Outlook - Other Proceedings;\"\n•\nHigher non-deferred storm restoration expenses and planned vegetation management costs;\n•\nLower investment earnings related to FEV’s equity method investment in Global Holding, net of an impairment charge in the fourth quarter 2024;\n•\nThe dilutive effect of the FET Equity Interest Sale that closed in March 2024;\n•\nHigher non-recoverable charges associated with regulatory proceedings and abandoned transmission projects;\n•\nHigher debt redemption costs; \n•\nHigher interest expense on long-term debt and short-term borrowings, partially offset by the redemption of certain FE long-term debt and higher capitalized financing costs; and\n•\nA higher effective tax rate due to tax charges related to the PA Consolidation and FET Equity Interest Sale in 2024, and the absence of a reduction in state income taxes and release of a valuation allowance recognized in 2023, partially offset by discrete tax benefits in 2024 associated with certain equity method investments and the remeasurement of excess deferred income taxes.\nThese were partially offset by the following: \n•\nNet proceeds from the shareholder derivative lawsuit settlement, as described below in “Outlook - Other Legal Proceedings”;\n•\nThe implementation of base rate case settlements in Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia;\n•\nHigher weather-related customer usage and demand;\n•\nIncreased earnings as a result of regulated investment programs that increased rate base;\n•\nHigher interest income on the FET Equity Interest Sale promissory notes;\n•\nLower Pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges;\n•\nThe absence of expenses associated with the cancellation of sponsorship agreements in 2023; and\n•\nLower labor and benefits expenses, including those associated with the PEER program and separation-related costs. \nDetailed segment reporting explanations are included below.\n39\nDistribution services by customer class are summarized in the following table:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\nActual\nWeather-Adjusted\nElectric Distribution MWh Deliveries\n(1)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease\n2024\n2023\nIncrease (Decrease)\nResidential\n54,631 \n52,217 \n4.6 \n%\n55,447 \n55,909 \n(0.8)\n%\nCommercial\n(2)\n39,021 \n38,179 \n2.2 \n%\n39,298 \n39,468 \n(0.4)\n%\nIndustrial\n52,950 \n52,252 \n1.3 \n%\n52,951 \n52,252 \n1.3 \n%\nTotal Electric Distribution MWh Deliveries\n146,602 \n142,648 \n2.8 \n%\n147,696 \n147,629 \n— \n%\n (1)\n Reflects the reclassification of certain Pennsylvania customers from Industrial to Commercial.

2024 Compared with 2023\nDistribution segment's earnings attributable to FE from continuing operations increased $37 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher customer usage as a result of the weather, lower Ohio customer rate credits and lower Pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges, partially offset by lower weather-adjusted customer usage and demand, lower revenues due to changes in the Ohio DCR that became effective June 1, 2024, and higher operating expenses, including increases in the ARO liability.\nRevenues —\nDistribution's total revenues

Revenues\n$\n6,863 \n$\n6,854 \n$\n9 \nDistribution services revenues increased $333 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher customer usage as a result of the weather, higher rider revenues associated with a Pennsylvania regulated investment program, and lower customer credits associated with the PUCO-approved Ohio Stipulation. Additionally, revenues increased due to the higher recovery of transmission expenses, and other FE PA rider rate adjustments, which have no material impact to earnings. Higher distribution services revenues were partially offset by lower weather-adjusted customer usage and demand, and lower revenues associated with changes to the Ohio DCR as a result of the PUCO’s ESP V order that became effective June 1, 2024. \nGeneration sales revenues decreased $320 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower retail generation sales as a result of increased customer shopping, partially offset by higher non-shopping generation auction rates. Total generation provided by alternative suppliers as a percentage of total MWh deliveries for the Ohio Companies and FE PA in 2024, as compared to 2023, increased to 90% from 77% in Ohio and increased to 63% from 62% in Pennsylvania. Retail and wholesale generation sales revenue have no material impact to earnings. \nOperating Expenses —\nTotal operating expenses increased $54 million, primarily due to the following:\n•\nPurchased power costs, which have no material impact to earnings, decreased $359 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower generation sales volumes, as described above, and decreased capacity expenses, partially offset by higher unit costs.\n•\nOther operating expenses increased $279 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to: \n•\nHigher network transmission expenses of $154 million, which are deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact to earnings;\n•\n$46 million charge related to changes in ARO liabilities associated with final CCR rules;\n•\n$32.5 million contribution commitment by the Ohio Companies, as a result of the PUCO's Ohio ESP V order;\n•\n$31 million impairment charge related to the Akron general office in the third quarter of 2024;\n•\nHigher planned vegetation management expenses of $57 million;\n•\nHigher energy efficiency and other state mandated program costs of $8 million, which were deferred for future recovery; \n•\nHigher storm restoration expenses of $48 million, of which $38 million were deferred for future recovery; and\n•\nHigher uncollectible expenses of $40 million, of which $14 million were deferred for future recovery, primarily due to a reduction to the allowance during 2023.\n45\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n•\nLower other operating expenses of $138 million, primarily due to lower labor and benefits expenses, including those associated with the PEER program and separation-related costs.\n•\nDepreciation expense increased $28 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to a higher asset base.\n•\nDeferral of regulatory assets decreased\n \n$88 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to a $17 million decrease of certain Tax Act savings deferrals to FE PA customers, $69 million decrease from lower net generation and transmission related deferrals, and $40 million related to net decreases in other deferrals, partially offset by $38 million increase due to higher deferral of storm related expenses.\n•\nGeneral taxes increased $18 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher gross receipts taxes.\nOther Expense —\nOther expense decreased $70 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to $69 million in lower pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges.\nIncome Taxes \nDistribution segment's effective tax rate was 17.8% and 20.0% for 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the remeasurement of excess deferred income taxes in 2024. \nIntegrated Segment — 2024 Compared with 2023\nIntegrated segment’s earnings attributable to FE from continuing operations increased $235 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily from the implementation of base rate cases, higher customer usage and demand, higher revenues from regulated investment programs, and lower Pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges, partially offset by higher operating expenses, including increases in the ARO liability, and a higher effective tax rate discussed below.\nRevenues — \nIntegrated segment’s total revenues increased $556 million as a result of the following sources:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nRevenues by Type of Service\n2024\n2023\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(In millions)\nDistribution services \n(1)\n$\n1,600 \n$\n1,411 \n$\n189 \nGeneration sales:\nRetail\n2,689 \n2,324 \n365 \nWholesale\n146 \n208 \n(62)\nTotal generation sales\n2,835 \n2,532 \n303 \nTransmission revenues:\nJCP&L\n243 \n206 \n37 \nMP & PE\n137 \n112 \n25 \nTotal transmission revenues\n380 \n318 \n62 \nOther\n61 \n59 \n2 \nTotal Revenues\n$\n4,876 \n$\n4,320 \n$\n556 \n \n(1)\n Includes $10 million of ARP revenues in 2024, related to lost distribution revenues associated with energy efficiency in New Jersey. \nDistribution services revenues increased $189 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher revenues from the implementation of base rate cases, higher customer usage as a result of the weather, higher weather-adjusted customer usage and demand, and higher rider revenues associated with certain regulated investment programs. Additionally, revenues increased due to the higher recovery of transmission expenses, which have no material impact to earnings. \n46\nGeneration sales revenues increased $303 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher retail revenues, partially offset by lower wholesale revenues. \n•\nRetail generation sales increased $365 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher customer usage as a result of the weather and higher non-shopping generation auction rates. Retail generation sales, other than those in West Virginia, have no material impact to earnings. \n•\nWholesale generation revenues decreased $62 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower capacity revenues and lower market prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. The difference between current wholesale generation revenues and certain energy costs incurred is deferred for future recovery or refund, with no material impact to earnings. \nTransmission revenues increased $62 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher rate base from regulated investment programs.\nOperating Expenses —\nTotal operating expenses increased $269 million, primarily due to:\n•\nFuel costs decreased $74 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower unit costs and consumption volumes. Due to the ENEC, fuel expense has no material impact to earnings. \n•\nPurchased power costs, which have no material impact to earnings, increased $161 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher unit costs and volumes, partially offset by lower capacity expenses.\n•\nOther operating expenses increased $168 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to:\n•\n$53 million charge at JCP&L in the first quarter of 2024 associated with certain corporate support costs recorded to capital accounts from the FERC Audit that were determined, as a result of the base rate case settlement agreement, to be disallowed from future recovery;\n•\nHigher storm restoration expenses of $80 million, of which $63 million was deferred for future recovery;\n•\nHigher network transmission expenses of $42 million, which were deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact to earnings;\n•\n$16 million charge related to changes in ARO liabilities associated with final CCR rules;\n•\n$17 million impairment charge related to the Akron general office in the third quarter of 2024;\n•\nHigher planned vegetation management costs of $15 million, of which $8 million were deferred for future recovery; \n•\nHigher uncollectible expenses of $17 million, which were mostly deferred for future recovery, primarily due to a reduction to the allowance during 2023; and\n•\nHigher energy efficiency and other state mandated program costs of $27 million, which were deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact to earnings.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n•\nLower other operating and maintenance expenses of $99 million, primarily due to lower labor and benefit expenses, including those associated with the PEER program and separation-related costs and lower regulated generation costs.\n•\nDepreciation expense increased $59 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to a higher asset base. \n•\nDeferral of regulatory assets increased $56 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to:\n•\n$63 million due to higher deferral of storm related expenses;\n•\n$60 million due to the approval in the first quarter of 2024 to recover costs of certain retired generation stations by the WVPSC;\n•\n$31 million related to net increases in other deferrals; and\n•\n$12 million due to higher energy efficiency related deferrals.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n•\n$98 million due to lower net generation and transmission related deferrals; and\n•\n$12 million due to higher vegetation management program-related amortizations.\n•\nGeneral taxes increased $11 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher gross receipts taxes. \n47\nOther Expense —\nOther expense decreased $64 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to $76 million in lower pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges, higher interest expense on short-term borrowings and higher non-recoverable charges related to abandoned transmission projects, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.\nIncome Taxes —\nIntegrated segment’s effective tax rate was 22.2% and 11.0% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the absence of discrete tax benefits related to the expected utilization of state NOL carryforwards and the release of an uncertain tax position related to state taxes recognized in 2023, partially offset by a remeasurement of excess deferred income taxes in 2024.\nStand-Alone Transmission Segment — 2024 Compared with 2023\nStand-Alone Transmission’s earnings attributable to FE from continuing operations decreased $105 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to the dilutive effect of the FET Equity Interest Sale that closed in March 2024, and a charge for an expected refund, with interest, as a result of the Sixth Circuit ruling eliminating the 50 basis point adder associated with RTO membership, partially offset by higher revenues from regulated capital investments that increased rate base.\nRevenues —\nTotal revenues increased $39 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, \nprimarily due to higher rate base \nand recovery of higher transmission operating expenses\n partially offset by \na charge for an expected refund as a result of the Sixth Circuit ruling eliminating the 50 basis point adder associated with RTO membership. \nRevenues by transmission asset owner are shown in the following table:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nRevenues by Transmission Asset Owner\n2024\n2023\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(In millions)\nATSI\n$\n990 \n$\n974 \n$\n16 \nTrAIL\n274 \n284 \n(10)\nMAIT\n440 \n399 \n41 \nKATCo\n85 \n89 \n(4)\nOther\n(2)\n2 \n(4)\nTotal Revenues\n$\n1,787 \n$\n1,748 \n$\n39 \n    \nOperating Expenses —\nTotal operating expenses increased $73 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher operation and maintenance costs, higher property taxes and depreciation due to a higher asset base and a $11 million charge from FESC in connection with its planned exit from the Akron general office. Other than the general office charge, nearly all operating expenses are recovered through formula rates, resulting in no material impact to earnings.\nOther Expense —\nTotal other expense decreased $31 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges of $38 million, partially offset by higher net financing costs associated with new debt issuances and interest related to the expected refund associated with the Sixth Circuit ruling noted above.\nIncome Taxes —\nStand-Alone Transmission's effective tax rate was 28.1% and 23.6% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to discrete tax charges related to the FET Equity Interest Sale in 2024, as well as the absence of a discrete tax benefit related to the expected utilization of state NOL carryforwards recognized in 2023.\n48\nCorporate/Other — 2024 Compared with 2023\nFinancial results from Corporate/Other resulted in a $312 million increase in losses attributable to FE from continuing operations for 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to:\n•\n$120 million related to a civil penalty with the SEC and a settlement with the OAG's office as further discussed below in “Outlook - Other Legal Proceedings”;\n•\n$111 million (after-tax) charge related to changes in ARO liabilities associated with final CCR rules and future expected costs to remediate McElroy’s Run;\n•\n$99 million (after-tax) from higher pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges;\n•\n$80 million (after-tax) in lower investment earnings related to FEV’s equity method investment in Global Holding;\n•\n$38 million (after-tax) of higher debt redemption costs;\n•\n$10 million (after-tax) related to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024 associated with FirstEnergy's actions to exit FEV's equity method investment in Global Holding;\n•\n$9 million (after-tax) of higher investigation and other related costs associated with the government investigations; and\n•\nLower income tax benefits in 2024 as a result of tax charges related to the PA Consolidation and FET Equity Interest Sale, the absence of a reduction in state income taxes and release of valuation allowances recognized in 2023, partially offset by discrete tax benefits recognized in 2024 associated with certain equity method investments. \nThe increase in losses were partially offset by:\n•\n$116 million (after-tax) of net proceeds from the shareholder derivative lawsuit settlement as described below in “Outlook - Other Legal Proceedings”;\n•\n$23 million (after-tax) of lower other operating expenses primarily related to the absence of expenses associated with the cancellation of certain sponsorship agreements in 2023;\n•\n$19 million (after-tax) of higher interest income on the FET Equity Interest Sale promissory notes; and\n•\n$16 million (after-tax) of lower interest expense as a result of the redemption of certain FE long-term debt and lower short-term borrowings.\n49\nSummary of Segment Results of Operations — 2023 Compared with 2022\nFinancial results for FirstEnergy’s business segments for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,

Revenues\n$\n6,854 \n$\n6,425 \n$\n429 \nDistribution services revenues increased $158 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to higher weather-adjusted customer usage and demand, higher rider revenues associated with a Pennsylvania regulated investment program, and lower customer credits associated with the PUCO-approved Ohio Stipulation. Higher distribution services revenues were partially offset by lower customer usage as a result of the weather and lower recovery of transmission expenses, which have no material impact to earnings.\nGeneration sales revenues increased $265 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to higher retail generation sales as a result of higher non-shopping generation auction rates, partially offset by lower customer usage as a result of the weather and increased customer shopping in Pennsylvania. Total generation provided by alternative suppliers as a percentage of total MWh deliveries in Pennsylvania increased to 62% in 2023 as compared to 60% in 2022. Retail and wholesale generation sales revenue have no material impact to earnings. \nOperating Expenses —\nTotal operating expenses increased $406 million primarily due to the following:\n•\nPurchased power costs, which have no material impact to earnings, increased $342 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to higher volumes, partially offset by lower unit costs and capacity expenses. \n•\nOther operating expenses increased $35 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to: \n•\nLump sum compensation and severance benefits of $24 million associated with the PEER program and involuntary separations in 2023;\n•\nHigher energy efficiency and other state mandated program costs of $26 million, which were deferred for future recovery; and\n•\nHigher storm restoration expenses of $95 million, which were mostly deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact to earnings recovery;\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n•\nLower vegetation management expenses of $72 million, including accelerated work during 2022;\n•\nLower network transmission expenses of $11 million, which are deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact to earnings; and\n•\nLower uncollectible expenses of $27 million, of which $4 million was deferred for future recovery.\n•\nDepreciation expense increased $27 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to a higher asset base.\n•\nDeferral of regulatory assets increased $18 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to:\n \n52\n•\n$83 million net increase due to higher generation and transmission related deferrals; and\n•\n$98 million increase due to higher deferral of storm related expenses;\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n•\n$100 million decrease due to the absence of a return of certain Tax Act savings to Pennsylvania customers in 2022;\n•\n$51 million decrease due to the absence of the customer refunds associated with the Ohio Stipulation; and\n•\n$12 million net decreases in other deferrals.\n•\nGeneral taxes increased $20 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to higher gross receipts taxes and Ohio property taxes, partially offset by lower Ohio kWh taxes.\nOther Expense —\nOther expense increased $165 million in 2023, as compared to 2023, primarily due to lower net pension and OPEB non-service credits, a $21 million change in pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges, higher net interest expense associated with new long-term issuances and higher short-term borrowings, and a charge from an environmental agreement requiring a $10 million contribution to the EPA associated with a former generation plant of OE.\nIncome Taxes \nDistribution segment's effective tax rate was 20.0% and 23.1% for 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nIntegrated Segment — 2023 Compared with 2022\nIntegrated segment’s earnings attributable to FE from continuing operations increased $35 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to lower other operating expenses, higher revenues from regulated investment programs and higher weather-adjusted customer usage and demand, partially offset by lower customer usage as a result of the weather, lower net pension and OPEB credits, and higher interest expense and costs from the PEER.\nRevenues — \nIntegrated segment’s total revenues decreased $150 million as a result of the following sources:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nRevenues by Type of Service\n2023\n2022\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(In millions)\nDistribution services\n$\n1,411 \n$\n1,459 \n$\n(48)\nGeneration sales:\nRetail\n2,324 \n2,209 \n115 \nWholesale\n208 \n475 \n(267)\nTotal generation sales\n2,532 \n2,684 \n(152)\nTransmission revenues:\nJCP&L\n206 \n203 \n3 \nMP & PE\n112 \n79 \n33 \nTotal transmission revenues\n318 \n282 \n36 \nOther\n59 \n45 \n14 \nTotal Revenues\n$\n4,320 \n$\n4,470 \n$\n(150)\n \nDistribution services revenues decreased $48 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to lower customer usage as a result of the weather and lower recovery of transmission expenses, partially offset by higher rider revenues associated with certain investment programs, and higher weather-adjusted customer usage and demand.\n53\nGeneration sales revenues decreased $152 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to lower wholesale revenues, partially offset by higher retail revenues.\n•\nRetail generation sales increased $115 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to higher non-shopping generation auction rates, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Retail generation sales, other than those in West Virginia, have no material impact to earnings. \n•\nWholesale generation revenues decreased $267 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to lower capacity revenues, market prices and sales volumes. The difference between current wholesale generation revenues and certain energy costs incurred is deferred for future recovery or refund, with no material impact to earnings. \nTransmission revenues increased $36 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to higher rate base from regulated investment programs.\nOperating Expenses —\nTotal operating expenses decreased $203 million, primarily due to:\n•\nFuel costs decreased $192 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to lower unit costs and consumption volumes. Due to the ENEC, fuel expense has no material impact to earnings. \n•\nPurchased power costs, which have no material impact to earnings, decreased $97 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to lower unit costs and capacity expenses, partially offset by higher volumes.\n•\nOther operating expenses decreased $70 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to:\n•\nLower network transmission expenses of $30 million, which are deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact to earnings;\n•\nLower uncollectible expenses of $19 million, which are deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact to earnings;\n•\nLower storm restoration expenses of $10 million, which were mostly deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact to earnings; and\n•\nLower expenses of $60 million, primarily due to the absence of the reclassification of certain transmission capital assets to operating expenses as a result of the FERC Audit.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n•\nLump sum compensation and severance benefits of $18 million associated with the PEER program and involuntary separations in 2023; \n•\nHigher vegetation management in West Virginia, energy efficiency and other state mandated program costs of $17 million, which were deferred for future recovery; and\n•\nHigher other operating expenses of $14 million, primarily due to higher contractor expenses, partially offset by fewer regulated generation planned outages.\n•\nDepreciation expense increased $32 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to a higher asset base. \n•\nDeferral of regulatory assets decreased $118 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to:\n•\n$181 million net decrease due to lower generation and transmission related deferrals; and\n•\n$8 million decrease due to lower deferral of storm related expenses.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n•\n$40 million increase due to lower vegetation management and other program-related amortizations;\n•\n$15 million increase due to higher energy efficiency related deferrals; and\n•\n$16 million related to net increases in other deferrals.\n•\nGeneral taxes increased $6 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to higher payroll taxes.\nOther Expense —\nOther expense increased $61 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to lower net pension and OPEB non-service credits, a $7 million change in pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges, and higher net interest expense associated with new long-term issuances and higher short-term borrowings.\n54\nIncome Taxes —\nIntegrated segment’s effective tax rate was 11.0% and 23.2% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to discrete tax benefits related to the expected utilization of state NOL carryforwards and the release of an uncertain tax position related to state taxes recognized in 2023.\nStand-Alone Transmission Segment — 2023 Compared with 2022\nStand-Alone Transmission's earnings attributable to FE from continuing operations increased $84 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to the absence of a reserve for customer refunds and the reclassification of certain transmission capital assets that are not expected to be recoverable resulting from the FERC Audit that was recognized in the third quarter of 2022, as further discussed below and as a result of regulated capital investments that increased rate base, partially offset by the dilutive effect of the 19.9% sale of FET equity interest that closed in May 2022.\nRevenues —\nTotal revenues increased $151 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to the absence of a reserve for customer refunds associated with the FERC Audit, as further discussed below, a true-up adjustment for the recovery of certain transmission formula rate operating costs during 2023 and a higher rate base.\nRevenues by transmission asset owner are shown in the following table: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nRevenues by Transmission Asset Owner\n2023\n2022\nIncrease\n(In millions)\nATSI\n$\n974 \n$\n918 \n$\n56 \nTrAIL\n284 \n275 \n9 \nMAIT\n399 \n344 \n55 \nKATCo\n89 \n59 \n30 \nOther\n2 \n1 \n1 \nTotal Revenues\n$\n1,748 \n$\n1,597 \n$\n151 \n    \nOperating Expenses —\nTotal operating expenses decreased $49 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to the absence of the reclassification of certain transmission capital assets to operating expenses as a result of the FERC Audit, as further discussed below, partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expenses from a higher asset base. Other than the write-off of nonrecoverable transmission assets, nearly all operating expenses are recovered through formula rates, resulting in no material impact on current period earnings.\nOther Expense —\nTotal other expense increased $40 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to a change in pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges of $22 million and pension and OPEB non-service credits partially offset by lower interest on long-term debt and borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and higher unregulated money pool interest income at FET.\nIncome Taxes —\nStand-Alone Transmission's effective tax rate was 23.6% and 24.2% for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCorporate/Other — 2023 Compared with 2022\nFinancial results from Corporate/Other resulted in a $685 million decrease in losses attributable to FE from continuing operations for 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to:\n•\nLower income tax expense primarily due to the absence of an income tax charge of $752 million in 2022, representing the deferred tax liability associated with the deferred tax gain on the 19.9% FET equity interest sale to Brookfield, and a 2023 tax benefit of $65 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions, from the reduction of state income taxes and partial release of a valuation allowance for the expected utilization of state NOL carryforwards based on an assessment of regulated business operation and the composition of a state tax return filing group, partially offset by a $58 million tax charge in 2023 associated with a true-up adjustment associated with the deferred tax gain on the 19.9% FET equity \n55\ninterest sale;\n•\n$105 million (after-tax) of lower debt redemption costs;\n•\n$6 million (after-tax) related to higher investment earnings on corporate-owned life insurance policies; and\n•\n$6 million (after-tax) in higher investment earnings related to FEV’s equity method investment in Global Holding.\nThe decrease in losses were partially offset by:\n•\n$78 million (after-tax) related to lower pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charges;\n•\n$23 million (after-tax) of higher other operating expenses primarily related to the expenses associated with the cancellation of certain sponsorship agreements in 2023;\n•\n$20 million (after-tax) from lower pension and OPEB non-service credits;\n•\n$16 million (after-tax) of higher investigation and other related costs associated with the government investigations; \n•\n$8 million (after-tax) for a charge associated with an update to the McElroy’s Run ARO; and\n•\n$5 million (after-tax) of higher interest expense from the 2026 Convertible Notes issuance.\nREGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nRegulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through future regulated rates or amounts collected from customers for costs not yet incurred. FirstEnergy, the Electric Companies and the Transmission Companies net their regulatory assets and liabilities based on federal and state jurisdictions. \nManagement assesses the probability of recovery of regulatory assets, and settlement of regulatory liabilities, at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur. Factors that may affect probability relate to changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation. Upon material changes to these factors, where applicable, FirstEnergy will record new regulatory assets and liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered or settled in future rates.\nThe following table provides information about the composition of net regulatory assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the changes during the year 2024: \nAs of December 31,\nNet Regulatory Assets (Liabilities) by Source\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \n(In millions)\nCustomer payables for future income taxes\n$\n(2,234)\n$\n(2,382)\n$\n148 \nSpent nuclear fuel disposal costs\n(72)\n(83)\n11 \nAsset removal costs\n(681)\n(652)\n(29)\nDeferred transmission costs\n190 \n286 \n(96)\nDeferred generation costs\n481 \n572 \n(91)\nDeferred distribution costs\n287 \n247 \n40 \nStorm-related costs\n1,015 \n799 \n216 \nEnergy efficiency program costs\n349 \n198 \n151 \nNew Jersey societal benefit costs\n87 \n79 \n8 \nVegetation management costs\n125 \n102 \n23 \nOther\n75 \n(11)\n86 \nNet Regulatory Liabilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n$\n(378)\n$\n(845)\n$\n467 \nThe following is a description of the regulatory assets and liabilities described above:\nCustomer payables for future income taxes \n- Reflects amounts to be recovered or refunded through future rates to pay income taxes that become payable when rate revenue is provided to recover items such as AFUDC equity and depreciation of property, plant and equipment for which deferred income taxes were not recognized for ratemaking purposes, including amounts attributable to federal and state tax rate changes such as the Tax Act and Pennsylvania House Bill 1342. These amounts are being amortized over the period in which the related deferred tax assets reverse, which is generally over the expected life of the underlying asset.\nSpent nuclear fuel disposal costs \n- Reflects amounts collected from customers, and the investment income, losses and changes in fair value of the trusts for spent nuclear fuel disposal costs related to former nuclear generating facilities, Oyster Creek and Three Mile Island Unit 1.\n56\nAsset removal costs \n- Primarily represents the rates charged to customers that include a provision for the cost of future activities to remove assets, including obligations for which an ARO has been recognized, that are expected to be incurred at the time of retirement.\nDeferred transmission costs \n- Reflects differences between revenues earned based on actual costs for the formula-rate Transmission Companies and the amounts billed, including amounts at December 31, 2023, expected to be refunded to, or recoverable from, wholesale transmission customers resulting from the FERC Audit, which amounts are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability and recovered or refunded, respectively, in subsequent periods. Also included is the recovery of non-market based costs or fees charged to certain of the Electric Companies by various regulatory bodies including FERC and RTOs, which can include PJM charges and credits for service including, but not limited to, procuring transmission services and transmission enhancement.\nDeferred generation costs\n - Primarily relates to regulatory assets associated with the securitized recovery of certain fuel and purchased power regulatory assets at the Ohio Companies (amortized through 2034) as well as the ENEC at MP and PE. MP and PE recover net power supply costs, including fuel costs, purchased power costs and related expenses, net of related market sales revenue through the ENEC. Generally, the ENEC rate is updated annually.\nDeferred distribution costs\n - Primarily relates to the Ohio Companies' deferral of certain distribution-related expenses, including interest (amortized through 2034).\nStorm-related costs\n - Relates to the deferral of storm costs, which vary by jurisdiction. Approximately $402 million and $254 million are currently being recovered through rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nEnergy efficiency program costs\n - Relates to the recovery of costs in excess of revenues associated with energy efficiency programs including New Jersey energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, FE PA's Energy Efficiency and Conservation programs, the Ohio Companies' Demand Side Management and Energy Efficiency Rider, and PE's EmPOWER Maryland Surcharge. Investments in certain of these energy efficiency programs earn a long-term return.\nNew Jersey societal benefit costs\n - Primarily relates to regulatory assets associated with MGP remediation, universal service and lifeline funds, and the New Jersey Clean Energy Program.\nVegetation management costs\n - Relates to regulatory assets associated with the recovery of certain distribution vegetation management costs in New Jersey, certain distribution and transmission vegetation management costs in West Virginia, and certain transmission vegetation management costs at ATSI (amortized through 2030) and KATCo (amortized through 2036).\nThe following table provides information about the composition of net regulatory assets that do not earn a current return as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, of which approximately $698 million and $371 million, respectively, are currently being recovered through rates over varying periods, through 2068, depending on the nature of the deferral and the jurisdiction:\nRegulatory Assets by Source Not Earning a\nAs of December 31,\nCurrent Return\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(In millions)\nDeferred transmission costs\n$\n8 \n$\n6 \n$\n2 \nDeferred generation costs\n314 \n432 \n(118)\nDeferred distribution costs\n153 \n68 \n85 \nStorm-related costs\n694 \n602 \n92 \nVegetation management\n16 \n21 \n(5)\nOther\n58 \n68 \n(10)\nRegulatory Assets Not Earning a Current Return\n$\n1,243 \n$\n1,197 \n$\n46 \nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nFirstEnergy’s business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction and other investment expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and interest payments, dividend payments and potential contributions to its pension plan.\nFE and its subsidiaries expect their existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet their respective anticipated obligations. In addition to internal sources to fund liquidity and capital requirements for 2025 and beyond, FE and its subsidiaries expect to rely on external sources of funds. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided from operations are generally satisfied through short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs may be met through the issuance of long-term debt by FE and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, fund capital expenditures and other capital-like investments, and \n57\nrefinance short-term and maturing long-term debt, subject to market conditions and other factors. FE may utilize instruments other than senior notes to fund its liquidity and capital requirements, including hybrid securities.\nCapital investments by business segment are included below: \nBusiness Segment\n2022 Actual\n2023 Actual\n2024\nActual\n \n(In millions)\nDistribution\n$\n1,047 \n$\n1,020 \n$\n1,285 \nIntegrated\n(1)\n1,111 \n1,336 \n1,690 \nStand-Alone Transmission\n1,005 \n1,273 \n1,427 \nCorporate/Other\n81 \n118 \n97 \nTotal\n$\n3,244 \n$\n3,747 \n$\n4,499 \n(1)\n Includes capital expenditures and capital-like investments that earn a return.\nCapital investment forecasts for the years ended 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, and 2029 by business segment are included below:\nBusiness Segment\n2025\nForecast\n2026 Forecast\n2027 Forecast\n2028 Forecast\n2029 Forecast\n \n(In millions)\nDistribution\n$\n1,405 \n$\n1,390 \n$\n1,460 \n$\n1,540 \n$\n1,645 \nIntegrated\n(1)\n1,835 \n1,910 \n2,150 \n2,410 \n2,530 \nStand-Alone Transmission\n(2)\n1,650 \n1,790 \n1,885 \n1,980 \n2,180 \nCorporate/Other\n85 \n70 \n75 \n65 \n70 \nTotal\n$\n4,975 \n$\n5,160 \n$\n5,570 \n$\n5,995 \n$\n6,425 \n(1)\n Includes capital expenditures and capital-like investments that earn a return.\n(2)\n Consolidated plan includes Brookfield's non-controlling interest in FET\nIn alignment with FirstEnergy’s strategy to invest in its segments as a fully regulated company, FirstEnergy is focused on maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility. Specifically, at the regulated businesses, regulatory authority has been obtained for various regulated subsidiaries to issue and/or refinance debt.\nAny financing plans by FE or any of its consolidated subsidiaries, including the issuance of equity and debt, and the refinancing of short-term and maturing long-term debt are subject to market conditions and other factors. No assurance can be given that any such issuances, financing or refinancing, as the case may be, will be completed as anticipated or at all. Any delay in the completion of financing plans could require FE or any of its consolidated subsidiaries to utilize short-term borrowing capacity, which could impact available liquidity. In addition, FE and its consolidated subsidiaries expect to continually evaluate any planned financings, which may result in changes from time to time.\nOn February 2, 2023, FE, along with FET, entered into the FET P&SA II with Brookfield and the Brookfield Guarantors, pursuant to which FE agreed to sell to Brookfield at the closing, and Brookfield agreed to purchase from FE, an incremental 30% equity interest in FET for a purchase price of $3.5 billion. The FET Equity Interest Sale closed on March 25, 2024 and FET continues to be consolidated in FirstEnergy’s financial statements. The purchase price was paid in part by the issuance of two promissory notes at closing having an aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion with: (i) one promissory note having an aggregate principal amount of $750 million, at an interest rate of 5.75% per annum, with a maturity date of September 25, 2025 and (ii) one promissory note having an aggregate principal amount of $450 million, at an interest rate of 7.75% per annum, with a maturity date of December 31, 2024. The remaining $2.3 billion of the purchase price was paid in cash at closing. On July 17, 2024, Brookfield paid FE approximately $1.2 billion in full satisfaction of the promissory notes. Interest income associated with the promissory notes was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and is reported within “Miscellaneous income, net” on FirstEnergy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result of the consummation of the transaction, Brookfield’s interest in FET increased from 19.9% to 49.9%, while FE retained the remaining 50.1% ownership interests of FET.\nOn January 1, 2024, FirstEnergy consolidated the Pennsylvania Companies into FE PA, rendering FE PA a new, single operating entity and the successor-in-interest to all assets and liabilities of the Pennsylvania Companies. As of January 1, 2024, FE PA is FE’s only regulated distribution power company in Pennsylvania encompassing the operations previously conducted individually by the Pennsylvania Companies. \nAlso on January 1, 2024, WP transferred certain of its Pennsylvania-based transmission assets to KATCo, and PN and ME contributed their respective Class B equity interests of MAIT to FE, which were ultimately contributed to FET in exchange for a special purpose membership interest in FET. So long as FE holds the FET special purpose membership interests, it will receive 100% of any Class B distributions made by MAIT.\n58\nEconomic conditions have stabilized across numerous material categories, but not all lead times have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Several key suppliers have seen improvements with capacity, but FirstEnergy continues to monitor the situation as demand increases across the industry, including due to data center usage. Inflationary pressures have moderated, which has improved the cost of materials, but certain categories have remained elevated. FirstEnergy continues to implement mitigation strategies to address supply constraints and does not expect any corresponding service disruptions or any material impact on its capital investment plan. However, the situation remains fluid and a prolonged continuation or further increase in demand, or the continuation of uncertain or adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures and new or increased existing tariffs, could lead to an increase in supply chain disruptions that could, in turn, have an adverse effect on FirstEnergy’s results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nIn February 2025, the new U.S. presidential administration announced the imposition of widespread and substantial tariffs on imports, with plans for additional tariffs to potentially be adopted in the future. Although certain of these tariffs were subsequently temporarily stayed, the situation is dynamic and subject to rapid change. The imposition of these or any other new or increased tariffs or resultant trade wars could have an adverse effect on FirstEnergy's results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nIn December 2023, FirstEnergy, executed a lift-out transaction with Banner Life Insurance Company and Reinsurance Group of America that transferred approximately $683 million of plan assets and $719 million of plan obligations, associated with approximately 1,900 former competitive generation employees, who will assume future and full responsibility to fund and administer their benefit payments. There was no change to the pension benefits for any participants as a result of the transfer. The transaction was funded by pension plan assets and resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $36 million, which was included in the fourth quarter 2023 pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment charge.\nAdditionally, in January 2025, FirstEnergy executed a lift-out transaction with MetLife, that transferred approximately $640 million of plan assets and $652 million of plan obligations, associated with approximately 2,000 former competitive generation employees, who will assume future and full responsibility to fund and administer their benefit payments. Similar to the lift-out in 2023, there was no change to the pension benefits for any participant as a result of the transfer and the transaction was funded by pension plan assets. FirstEnergy believes that this lift-out transaction, in addition to the lift-out in 2023, further de-risked potential volatility with the pension plan assets and liabilities, and will continue to evaluate other lift-outs in the future based on market and other conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, FirstEnergy’s net deficit in working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was primarily due to accounts payable, current portion of long-term debt, short-term borrowings and accrued interest, taxes, and compensation and benefits. FirstEnergy believes its cash from operations and available liquidity will be sufficient to meet its current working capital needs. See further discussion on cash from operations below.\nShort-Term Borrowings / Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn October 24, 2024, FE and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the following amendments to each of the 2021 Credit Facilities to, among other things: (i) extend the maturity date of the 2021 Credit Facilities for an additional one-year period, from October 18, 2027 to October 18, 2028, and (ii) increase the borrowing limit of the JCP&L credit facility from $500 million to $750 million. Also on October 24, 2024, each of FET and KATCo entered into amendments of the 2023 Credit Facilities, to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the 2023 Credit Facilities for an additional one-year period, from October 20, 2028 to October 20, 2029 and from October 20, 2027 to October 20, 2028, for the FET credit facility and KATCo credit facility, respectively.\nThe 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities, as amended on October 24, 2024, are as follows:\n•\nFE, $1.0 billion revolving credit facility;\n•\nFET, $1.0 billion revolving credit facility;\n•\nOhio Companies, $800 million revolving credit facility;\n•\nFE PA, $950 million revolving credit facility;\n•\nJCP&L, $750 million revolving credit facility;\n•\nMP and PE, $400 million revolving credit facility;\n•\nATSI, MAIT and TrAIL, $850 million revolving credit facility; and\n•\nKATCo, $150 million revolving credit facility. \nBorrowings under the 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Generally, borrowings under each of the credit facilities are available to each borrower separately and mature on the earlier of 364 days from the date of borrowing or the commitment termination date, as the same may be extended. Each of the 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities contain financial covenants requiring each borrower, with the exception of FE, to maintain a consolidated debt-to-total-capitalization ratio (as defined under each of the 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities) of no more than 65%, and 75% for FET, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. FE is required under its credit facility to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 times, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter for the last four fiscal quarters.\n59\nThe 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities bear interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on SOFR, including term SOFR and daily simple SOFR. FirstEnergy has not hedged its interest rate exposure with respect to its floating rate debt. Accordingly, FirstEnergy’s interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on SOFR and other variable interest rates. Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could have an adverse effect on FirstEnergy’s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\nFirstEnergy had $550 million and $775 million of outstanding short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

However, FE is required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 times, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter for the last four fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 2021. FE's consolidated interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2024 was approximately 4.5 times. \nSubject to each borrower’s sublimit, the amounts noted below are available for the issuance of LOCs (subject to borrowings drawn under the 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities) expiring up to one year from the date of issuance. The stated amount of outstanding LOCs will count against total commitments available under each of the 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities and against the applicable borrower’s borrowing sublimit.

Pricing is defined in “pricing grids,” whereby the cost of funds borrowed under the 2021 Credit Facilities and the 2023 Credit Facilities are related to the credit ratings of the company borrowing the funds. Additionally, borrowings under each of the 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities are subject to the usual and customary provisions for acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default, including a cross-default for other indebtedness in excess of $100 million.\nAs of December 31, 2024, FE was in compliance with its applicable consolidated interest coverage ratio and the borrowers in each case as defined under the 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities, were in compliance with their debt-to-total-capitalization ratio covenants.\nFirstEnergy Money Pools \nFirstEnergy’s regulated operating subsidiary companies also have the ability to borrow from each other and FE to meet their short-term working capital requirements. Effective September 23, 2024, AGC and KATCo became participants in the regulated companies’ money pool. Similar but separate arrangements exist among FirstEnergy’s unregulated companies with AE Supply, FE, FET, FEV and certain other unregulated subsidiaries. As of June 1, 2024, FET no longer participated in the unregulated money pool. FESC administers these money pools and tracks surplus funds of FE and the respective regulated and unregulated subsidiaries, as the case may be, as well as proceeds available from bank borrowings. Companies receiving a loan under the money pool agreements must repay the principal amount of the loan, together with accrued interest, within 364 days of borrowing the funds. The rate of interest is the same for each company receiving a loan from their respective pool and is based on the average cost of funds available through the pool.\nAverage Interest Rates\nRegulated Companies’ Money Pool\nUnregulated Companies’ Money Pool\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nFor the Years Ended December 31, \n5.74 \n%\n6.30 \n%\n6.44 \n%\n6.01 \n%\n61\nLong-Term Debt Capacity\nFE’s and its subsidiaries’ access to capital markets and costs of financing are influenced by the credit ratings of their securities.

The applicable fee paid on the undrawn commitments under the 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities are based on each borrower’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt ratings as determined by S&P and Moody’s. The fees paid on actual borrowings are determined based on each borrower’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt ratings as determined by S&P and Moody’s.\nThe interest rates payable on approximately $2.1 billion in FE’s senior unsecured notes are subject to adjustments from time to time if the ratings on the notes from any one or more of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch decreases to a rating set forth in the applicable governing documents. Generally, a one-notch downgrade by the applicable rating agency may result in a 25 basis point coupon rate increase beginning at BB, Ba1, and BB+ for S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, to the extent such rating is applicable to the series of outstanding senior unsecured notes, during the next interest period, subject to an aggregate cap of 2% from issuance interest rate.\nDebt capacity is subject to the consolidated interest coverage ratio in FE's credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, FirstEnergy could incur approximately $930 million of incremental interest expense or incur an approximate $2.3 billion reduction to the consolidated interest coverage earnings numerator, as defined under the covenant, and FE would remain within the limitations of the financial covenant requirements of FE's credit facility.\n62\nCash Requirements and Commitments \nFirstEnergy has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, including contracts executed in connection with certain of the planned construction expenditures. \nAs of December 31, 2024 (Undiscounted): \nTotal\n2025\n2026-2027\n2028-2029\nThereafter\n(In millions)\nLong-term debt\n(1)\n$\n23,594 \n$\n973 \n$\n4,879 \n$\n3,517 \n$\n14,225 \nShort-term borrowings\n550 \n550 \n— \n— \n— \nInterest on long-term debt\n9,994 \n996 \n1,730 \n1,404 \n5,864 \nOperating leases\n(2)\n282 \n61 \n104 \n71 \n46 \nFinance leases\n(2)\n15 \n4 \n7 \n4 \n— \nFuel and purchased power\n(3)\n1,494 \n221 \n429 \n341 \n503 \nCommitted investments\n(4)\n7,284 \n3,247 \n2,555 \n1,482 \n— \nPension funding\n(5)\n1,791 \n— \n311 \n587 \n893 \nTotal\n$\n45,004 \n$\n6,052 \n$\n10,015 \n$\n7,406 \n$\n21,531 \n(1)\n Excludes unamortized discounts and premiums, fair value accounting adjustments and finance leases.\n(2)\n See Note 8, \"Leases,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(3)\n Based on estimated annual amounts under contract with fixed or minimum quantities, and includes payment obligations under termination agreements.\n(4)\n Amounts represent committed capital expenditures and other capital-like investments that earn a return.\n(5) \nAs discussed further below, FirstEnergy does not currently expect to have a required contribution to the pension plan until 2027.\nExcluded from the table above are estimates for the cash outlays from power purchase contracts entered into by most of the Electric Companies and under which they procure the power supply necessary to provide generation service to their customers who do not choose an alternative supplier. Although actual amounts will be determined by future customer behavior, consumption levels and power prices, management currently estimates these cash outlays will be approximately $4.1 billion in 2025.\nThe table above also excludes AROs, reserves for litigation, injuries and damages and environmental remediation since the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. The table also excludes accumulated deferred income taxes since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each applicable fiscal year and/or the application of the corporate AMT which, as further discussed below, is uncertain and subject to the issuance of future U.S. Treasury regulations.\nFirstEnergy’s pension funding policy is based on actuarial computations using the projected unit credit method. FirstEnergy does not currently expect to have a required contribution to the pension plan until 2027, which based on various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on assets of 8.5% for 2025, is expected to be approximately $300 million. However, FirstEnergy may elect to contribute to the pension plan voluntarily.\nConvertible Notes\nAs discussed above, on May 4, 2023, FE issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes, with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2023. The 2026 Convertible Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of FE, and will mature on May 1, 2026, unless required to be converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. However, FE may not elect to redeem the 2026 Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date. The 2026 Convertible Notes are included within “Long-term debt and other long-term obligations” on the FirstEnergy Consolidated Balance Sheets. Proceeds from the issuance were approximately $1.48 billion, net of issuance costs.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 1, 2026, the 2026 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only under the following conditions:\n•\nDuring any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of FE’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\n•\nDuring the five consecutive business day period immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes for each trading day of such 10 trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of FE’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or\n•\nUpon the occurrence of certain corporate events specified in the indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Notes. \n63\nOn and after February 1, 2026, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Convertible Notes at their option at any time at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions. FE will settle conversions of the 2026 Convertible Notes, if any, by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes being converted and by paying cash or delivering shares of FE’s common stock (or a combination of each), at its election, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes being converted.\nThe conversion rate for the 2026 Convertible Notes will initially be 21.3620 shares of FE’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $46.81 per share of FE’s common stock). The initial conversion price of the 2026 Convertible Notes represents a premium of approximately 20% over the last reported sale price of FE’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2023. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. FE may not elect to redeem the 2026 Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date.\nIf FE undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes may require FE to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2026 Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the relevant indenture). In addition, if certain fundamental changes occur, FE may be required, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for any 2026 Convertible Notes converted in connection with such fundamental changes by a specified number of shares of its common stock.\nChanges in Cash Position\nAs of December 31, 2024, FirstEnergy had $111 million of cash and cash equivalents and $43 million of restricted cash compared to $137 million of cash and cash equivalents and $42 million of restricted cash as of December 31, 2023, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nThe following table summarizes the major classes of cash flow items:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided from operating activities\n$\n2,891 \n$\n1,387 \n$\n2,683 \nNet cash used for investing activities\n(4,350)\n(3,652)\n(3,076)\nNet cash provided from (used for) financing activities\n1,434 \n2,238 \n(912)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(25)\n(27)\n(1,305)\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period\n179 \n206 \n1,511 \nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period\n$\n154 \n$\n179 \n$\n206 \nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nFirstEnergy’s most significant sources of cash are derived from electric service provided by its operating subsidiaries. The most significant use of cash from operating activities is buying electricity to serve non-shopping customers, return of cash collateral associated with certain generation suppliers that serve shopping customers, pension contributions and paying fuel suppliers, employees, tax authorities, lenders and others for a wide range of materials and services. \nNet cash provided from operating activities was $2,891 million during 2024, $1,387 million during 2023, and $2,683 million during 2022. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2024 from 2023 is primarily due to:\n•\nLower payments, primarily on generation energy purchases for certain customers, net of related customer receivable receipts;\n•\nThe return of cash collateral in 2024 that was previously posted with PJM, which was replaced with issuances of letters of credit;\n•\nThe absence of cash collateral returned to certain generation suppliers that serve shopping customers during 2023 that was previously received as a result of changes in power prices;\n•\n$750 million cash contribution to qualified pension plan in the second quarter of 2023;\n•\nReceipt of the derivative lawsuit settlement proceeds in the second quarter of 2024;\n•\nHigher net transmission revenue collection based on the timing of formula rate collections; and\n•\nHigher returns from distribution, integrated, and transmission capital investments.\n64\nThe increase in cash provided from operating activities was partially offset by:\n•\nLower dividend distribution received by FEV from its equity investments in Global Holding;\n•\nHigher payments associated with Pennsylvania gross receipts taxes; and\n•\nPayment of the SEC civil penalty and OAG settlement in the third quarter of 2024.\nFirstEnergy's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows combines cash flows from discontinued operations with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow category.

On October 8, 2024, FET filed a registration statement on Form S-4 for the exchange offer with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 20, 2024. On January 24, 2025, FET completed an exchange offer of these senior notes for like principal amounts registered under the Securities Act.\nAs noted above, on December 5, 2024, JCP&L issued $700 million of unsecured senior notes due in 2035 in a private offering that included a registration rights agreement in which JCP&L agreed to conduct an exchange offer of these senior notes for like principal amounts registered under the Securities Act. JCP&L also agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC to cover resales of the senior notes under certain circumstances. In the event that JCP&L's exchange offer is not completed or the shelf registration statement, if required, is not effective by the 366th day after December 5, 2024, or the effective shelf registration stops being effective for 60 days during any 12-month period, then additional interest will accrue on the coupon. Interest will accrue at a rate of 25 basis points for the first 90 days and an additional 25 basis points in the subsequent 90-day period, but not to exceed 50 basis points per year. However, if the additional interest is triggered, the interest rate will reset to the original notes rate once the registration statement is effective, or the shelf registration, if required, becomes effective. JCP&L plans to file a registration statement for the exchange offer before the end of the first quarter of 2025.\nFE or its affiliates may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as FE or its affiliates may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nGUARANTEES AND OTHER ASSURANCES\nFirstEnergy has various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications which are issued in the normal course of business. These contracts include performance guarantees, stand-by LOCs, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. FirstEnergy enters into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. As of December 31, 2024, outstanding guarantees and other assurances aggregated approximately $923 million, consisting of parental guarantees on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries ($495 million) and other assurances ($428 million). \nCollateral and Contingent-Related Features\nIn the normal course of business, FE and its subsidiaries may enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the sale and purchase of electric capacity, energy, fuel and emission allowances. Certain agreements contain provisions that require FE or its subsidiaries to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon FE's or its subsidiaries' credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $170 million of collateral, in the form of LOCs, has been posted by FE or its subsidiaries. FE or its subsidiaries are holding $29 million of net cash collateral as of December 31, 2024, from certain generation suppliers, and such amount is included in \"Other current liabilities\" on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThese credit-risk-related contingent features stipulate that if the subsidiary were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide additional collateral. See Note 15, \"Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nMARKET RISK INFORMATION\nFirstEnergy uses various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts, primarily to manage the risk of price and interest rate fluctuations. FirstEnergy’s Enterprise Risk Management Committee, comprised of members of senior management, provides general oversight for risk management activities throughout FirstEnergy, including market risk.\nCommodity Price Risk\nFirstEnergy has limited exposure to financial risks resulting from fluctuating commodity prices, including prices for electricity, coal and energy transmission. \nThe valuation of derivative contracts is based on observable market information. As of December 31, 2024, FirstEnergy has a net asset of $7 million in non-hedge derivative contracts that are related to FTRs at certain of the Electric Companies. FTRs are subject to regulatory accounting and do not impact earnings.\n67\nEquity Price Risk\nAs of December 31, 2024, the FirstEnergy pension plan assets were allocated approximately as follows: 25% in public equity securities, 23% in fixed income securities, 4% in hedge funds, 1% in insurance-linked securities, (1)% in derivatives, 9% in real estate funds, 20% in private equity and debt funds and 19% in cash and short-term securities. FirstEnergy does not currently expect to have a required contribution to the pension plan until 2027, which based upon various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on assets of 8.5% for 2025, is expected to be approximately $300 million. However, FirstEnergy may elect to contribute to the pension plan voluntarily. \nAs of December 31, 2024, FirstEnergy's OPEB plan assets were allocated approximately as follows: 55% in equity securities, 25% in fixed income securities and 20% in cash and short-term securities. See Note 5, \"Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on FirstEnergy's pension and OPEB plans. \nDuring 2024, FirstEnergy's pension plan assets have lost approximately 0.4% as compared to an annual expected return on plan assets of 8.0%, and FirstEnergy's OPEB plan assets have gained approximately 13.4% as compared to an annual expected return on plan assets of 7.0%. \nInterest Rate Risk\nFirstEnergy’s exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is largely mitigated as all long-term debt, with the exception of the 2021 Credit Facilities and the 2023 Credit Facilities, has fixed interest rates, as noted in the table below. However, FirstEnergy is subject to the inherent interest rate risks related to refinancing maturing debt by issuing new debt securities.\nComparison of Carrying Value to Fair Value as of December 31, 2024\nYear of Maturity or Notice of Redemption\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThere-after\nTotal\nFair Value\n(In millions)\nAssets:\nInvestments Other Than Cash and Cash Equivalents:\nFixed Income\n$\n24 \n$\n20 \n$\n15 \n$\n2 \n$\n6 \n$\n203 \n$\n270 \n$\n270 \nAverage interest rate\n4.9 \n%\n4.5 \n%\n4.8 \n%\n5.1 \n%\n4.9 \n%\n4.9 \n%\n4.5 \n%\nLiabilities:\nLong-term Debt:\nFixed rate\n$\n973 \n$\n2,876 \n$\n2,003 \n$\n2,453 \n$\n1,064 \n$\n14,225 \n$\n23,594\n$\n22,128 \nAverage interest rate\n3.3 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n3.8 \n%\n3.8 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n4.6 \n%\n4.3 \n%\nFirstEnergy recognizes net actuarial gains or losses for its pension and OPEB plans in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement (which occurred during the second quarter of 2023). A primary factor contributing to these actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rates used to value pension and OPEB obligations as of the measurement date and the difference between expected and actual returns on the plans’ assets. \nThe remaining components of pension and OPEB expense, primarily service costs, interest cost on obligations, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs, are set at the beginning of the calendar year (unless a remeasurement is triggered) and are recorded on a monthly basis. Changes in asset performance and discount rates will not impact these pension costs during the year, however, future years could be impacted by changes in the market.\nOn May 12, 2023, FirstEnergy made a $750 million voluntary cash contribution to the qualified pension plan. The size of the voluntary contribution made on May 12, 2023, in relation to total pension assets triggered a remeasurement of the pension plan. FirstEnergy elected the practical expedient to remeasure pension plan assets and obligations as of April 30, 2023, which is the month-end closest to the date of the voluntary contribution.\nFirstEnergy utilizes a spot rate approach in the estimation of the components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the full yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The discount rate used to measure pension obligations was 5.72% as of December 31, 2024 compared to 4.94% as of April 30, 2023 and 5.05% as of December 31, 2023. The discount rate used to measure OPEB obligations was 5.60% as of December 31, 2024 as compared to 4.97% as of December 31, 2023.\nThe 2021 Credit Facilities and 2023 Credit Facilities bear interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on SOFR, including term SOFR and daily simple SOFR. FirstEnergy has not hedged its interest rate exposure with respect to its floating rate debt. Accordingly, FirstEnergy’s interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on SOFR and other variable interest rates. \n68\nEconomic Conditions \nEconomic conditions have stabilized across numerous material categories, but not all lead times have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Several key suppliers have seen improvements with capacity, but FirstEnergy continues to monitor the situation as demand increases across the industry, including due to data center usage. Inflationary pressures have moderated, which has improved the cost of materials, but certain categories have remained elevated. FirstEnergy continues to implement mitigation strategies to address supply constraints and does not expect any corresponding service disruptions or any material impact on its capital investment plan. However, the situation remains fluid and a prolonged continuation or further increase in demand, or the continuation of uncertain or adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures and new or increased existing tariffs, could lead to an increase in supply chain disruptions that could, in turn, have an adverse effect on FirstEnergy’s results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nIn February 2025, the new U.S. presidential administration announced the imposition of widespread and substantial tariffs on imports, with plans for additional tariffs to potentially be adopted in the future. Although certain of these tariffs were subsequently temporarily stayed, the situation is dynamic and subject to rapid change. The imposition of these or any other new or increased tariffs or resultant trade wars could have an adverse effect on FirstEnergy's results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nCREDIT RISK\nCredit risk is the risk that FirstEnergy would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. FirstEnergy maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstance in order to limit counterparty credit risk. FirstEnergy has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact FirstEnergy's overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. In the event an energy supplier of the Ohio Companies, FE PA, JCP&L or PE defaults on its obligation, the affected company would be required to seek replacement power in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, it is expected that appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities. FirstEnergy's credit policies to manage credit risk include the use of an established credit approval process, daily credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit. \nOUTLOOK\nINCOME TAXES\nThe IRA of 2022, among other things, imposes a new 15% corporate AMT based on AFSI applicable to corporations with a three-year average AFSI over $1 billion. The AMT is effective for the 2023 tax year and, if applicable, corporations must pay the greater of the regular corporate income tax or the AMT. The IRA of 2022 requires the U.S. Treasury to provide regulations and other guidance necessary to administer the AMT, including further defining allowable adjustments to determine AFSI, which directly impacts the amount of AMT to be paid. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Treasury issued proposed regulations for the AMT for comments. FirstEnergy is assessing the proposed regulations but continues to believe that it is more likely than not it will be subject to AMT, however, the completion of the U.S. Treasury’s rulemaking process and the future issuance of final regulations, as well as potential future federal tax legislation or presidential executive orders, could significantly change FirstEnergy’s AMT estimates or its conclusion as to whether it is an AMT payer at all. As further discussed below, FirstEnergy expects to pay regular federal corporate income tax for the 2024 tax year, due in large part to the gain realized from closing the FET Equity Interest Sale. The regulatory treatment of the IRA of 2022 may also be subject to regulation by FERC and/or applicable state regulatory authorities. Any adverse development in the IRA of 2022, including guidance from the U.S. Treasury and/or the IRS or unfavorable regulatory treatment, could negatively impact FirstEnergy’s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, on March 25, 2024, FirstEnergy closed on the FET Equity Interest Sale realizing an approximate $7 billion tax gain from the combined sale of 49.9% of the equity interests of FET for consideration received and recapture of negative tax basis in FET. As of December 31, 2023, FirstEnergy had approximately $8.1 billion of gross federal NOL carryforwards available to offset a majority of the tax gain and expected taxable income in 2024. Due to certain limitations on NOL utilization enacted in the Tax Act, approximately $1.6 billion NOL will carry forward into 2025 and possibly beyond. In the first quarter of 2024, FirstEnergy recognized a net tax charge of approximately $46 million, comprised of updates to estimated deferred tax liability for the deferred gain from the 19.9% FET equity interest sale in May 2022, deferred tax liability related to its ongoing investment in FET, and valuation allowance associated with the expected utilization of certain state NOL carryforwards impacted by the sale and the PA consolidation, and recognized a reduction to OPIC of approximately $803 million for federal and state income tax associated with the tax gain from closing on the FET Equity Interest Sale. Previously, in the fourth quarter of 2023, FirstEnergy recognized a charge to income tax expense of approximately $58 million as a true-up of the deferred tax liability associated with the deferred tax gain. \n69\nSTATE REGULATION\nEach of the Electric Companies retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and other matters are subject to regulation in the states in which it operates - in Maryland by the MDPSC, in New Jersey by the NJBPU, in Ohio by the PUCO, in Pennsylvania by the PPUC, in West Virginia by the WVPSC and in New York by the NYPSC. The transmission operations of PE and TrAIL in Virginia, ATSI in Ohio, the Transmission Companies in Pennsylvania, PE and MP in West Virginia, and PE in Maryland are subject to certain regulations of the VSCC, PUCO, PPUC, WVPSC, and MDPSC, respectively. In addition, under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate rates of a public utility, subject to appeal to the PUCO if not acceptable to the utility. Further, if any of the FirstEnergy affiliates were to engage in the construction of significant new transmission facilities, depending on the state, they may be required to obtain state regulatory authorization to site, construct and operate the new transmission facility. \nThe following table summarizes the key terms of state base rate orders in effect for the Electric Companies as of December 31, 2024: \nCompany\nRates Effective For Customers\nAllowed Debt/Equity\nAllowed ROE\nCEI\nMay 2009\n51%/ 49%\n10.5%\nFE PA\n(1)\nJanuary 2017\nSettled\n(2)\nSettled\n(2)\nMP\nMarch 2024\nSettled\n(2)\n9.8%\nJCP&L\nJune 2024\n48.1% / 51.9%\n9.6%\nOE\nJanuary 2009\n51% /49%\n10.5%\nPE (West Virginia)\nMarch 2024\nSettled\n(2)\n9.8%\nPE (Maryland)\nOctober 2023\n47% / 53%\n9.5%\nTE\nJanuary 2009\n51% / 49%\n10.5%\n(1) \nAs further discussed below, new rates became effective for customers on January 1, 2025, and did not disclose allowed debt/equity and ROE rates.\n(2) \nCommission-approved settlement agreements did not disclose allowed debt/equity and/or ROE rates.\nMARYLAND\nPE operates under MDPSC approved distribution base rates that were effective as of October 19, 2023, and that were subsequently modified by an MDPSC order dated January 3, 2024, which became effective as of March 1, 2024. PE also provides SOS pursuant to a combination of settlement agreements, MDPSC orders and regulations, and statutory provisions. SOS supply is competitively procured in the form of rolling contracts of varying lengths through periodic auctions that are overseen by the MDPSC and a third-party monitor. Although settlements with respect to SOS supply for PE customers have expired, service continues in the same manner until changed by order of the MDPSC. PE recovers its costs plus a return for providing SOS.\nThe EmPOWER Maryland program previously required each electric utility to file a plan to reduce electric consumption and demand 0.2% per year, up to the ultimate goal of 2% annual savings. The passage of the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 modified the annual incremental energy efficiency targets to 2% per year from 2022 through 2024, 2.25% per year in 2025 and 2026, and 2.5% per year in 2027 and thereafter. On August 1, 2023, PE filed its proposed plan for the 2024-2026 cycle as required by the MDPSC. Additionally, at the direction of the MDPSC, PE together with other Maryland utilities were required to address GHG reductions in addition to energy efficiency. In compliance with the MDPSC directive, PE submitted three scenarios with projected costs over a three-year cycle of $311 million, $354 million, and $510 million, respectively. The MDPSC conducted hearings on the proposed plans for all Maryland utilities on November 6-8, 2023. On December 29, 2023, the MDPSC issued an order approving the $311 million scenario for most programs, with some modifications. On August 15, 2024, in accordance with the MDPSC directive, PE filed a revised plan for the remainder of the 2024-2026 cycle to comply with refined GHG reduction targets with a total budget of $314 million. On December 27, 2024, the MDPSC issued an order approving PE’s revised plan. PE recovers EmPOWER program costs with a return on unamortized balances through an annually reconciled surcharge, with certain costs subject to recovery over a five-year amortization period. Maryland law only allows for the utility to recover lost distribution revenue attributable to energy efficiency or demand reduction programs through a base rate case proceeding. Consistent with a December 29, 2022, order by the MDPSC phasing out the unamortized balances of EmPOWER investments, PE is required to expense 33% of its EmPOWER program costs in 2024, 67% in 2025, and 100% in 2026 and beyond. Notwithstanding the order to phase out the unamortized balances of EmPOWER investments, all previously unamortized costs for prior cycles were to be collected by the end of 2029, consistent with the plan PE submitted on January 11, 2023. In the 2024-2026 order issued on December 29, 2023, the period to pay down the unamortized balances was extended through the end of 2030. On February 21, 2024, the MDPSC approved PE’s tariff to recover costs in 2024 but directed PE to analyze alternative amortization methods for possible use in later years. On November 27, 2024, PE filed for approval of revised tariff pages reflecting an update of the PE tariff becoming effective in 2025, which included the requested analysis of alternative amortization methods. On December 18, 2024, the MDPSC approved the revised tariff pages permitting PE to continue to use its preferred amortization method. New legislation signed into law on May 9, 2024, and effective July 1, 2024, is expected to reduce \n70\nthe return on the EmPOWER unamortized balances for PE by a total of $25 to $30 million over the period of 2024-2030. On July 31, 2024, the MDPSC issued an order implementing revised EmPOWER surcharge rates for PE in accordance with the new law and denying PE’s request for a hearing that sought to challenge certain portions of the law. On August 30, 2024, PE filed a petition seeking judicial review of its challenge to the law. The MDPSC and Maryland Office of People’s Counsel filed intents to participate. On November 15, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to postpone the February 7, 2025 hearing date scheduled by the court and proposed a briefing schedule. The motion was granted on December 28, 2024. PE filed a Petitioner Memorandum on December 17, 2024. The MDPSC and Maryland Office of People’s Counsel filed a Response Memorandum on January 28, 2025. PE filed a Reply Memorandum on February 20, 2025. A hearing is scheduled for March 7, 2025. \nNEW JERSEY\nJCP&L operates under NJBPU approved rates that took effect as of February 15, 2024, and became effective for customers as of June 1, 2024. JCP&L provides BGS for retail customers who do not choose a third-party EGS and for customers of third- party EGSs that fail to provide the contracted service. All New Jersey EDCs participate in this competitive BGS procurement process and recover BGS costs directly from customers as a charge separate from base rates.\nThe base rate increase approved by the NJBPU on February 14, 2024, took effect on February 15, 2024, and became effective for customers on June 1, 2024. Until those new rates became effective for customers, JCP&L was amortizing an existing regulatory liability totaling approximately $18 million to offset the base rate increase that otherwise would have occurred in this period. Under the base rate case settlement agreement, JCP&L also agreed to a two-phase reliability improvement plan to enhance the reliability related to 18 high-priority circuits, the first phase of which began on February 14, 2024, and represents an approximate investment of $95 million. Additionally, JCP&L recognized a $53 million pre-tax charge in the first quarter 2024 at the Integrated segment within “Other operating expenses” on the FirstEnergy Consolidated Statements of Income, associated with certain corporate support costs recorded to capital accounts from the FERC Audit that were determined, as a result of the settlement agreement, to be disallowed from future recovery.\nJCP&L has implemented energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs in accordance with the New Jersey Clean Energy Act as approved by the NJBPU in April 2021. The NJBPU approved plans include recovery of lost revenues resulting from the programs and a three-year plan (July 2021-June 2024) including total program costs of $203 million, of which $160 million of investment is recovered over a ten-year amortization period with a return as well as $43 million in operations and maintenance expenses and financing costs recovered on an annual basis. On May 22, 2024, the NJBPU approved JCP&L’s request for a six-month extension of the EE&C Plan I, to December 31, 2024. The budget for the extension period adds approximately $69 million to the original program cost and JCP&L will recover the costs of the extension period and the revenue impact of sales losses resulting therefrom through two separate tariff riders. On December 1, 2023, JCP&L filed a related petition with the NJBPU requesting approval of its EE&C Plan II, which covers the January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2027 period and had a proposed budget of approximately $964 million. EE&C Plan II, as filed, consisted of a portfolio of ten energy efficiency programs, one peak demand reduction program and one building decarbonization program. Under the proposal, JCP&L would recover its EE&C Plan II revenue requirements and lost revenues from reduced electricity sales associated with EE&C Plan II. On October 30, 2024, the NJBPU approved the parties’ stipulation of settlement, wherein the parties agreed to a budget of approximately $817 million for EE&C Plan II, including $784 million of investments that will earn a return on equity of 9.6%, with an equity ratio of 52%, and be recovered over 10 years.\nThe settlement of the distribution rate case in 2020, provided among other things, that JCP&L would be subject to a management audit, which began in May 2021. On April 12, 2023, the NJBPU accepted the final management audit report for filing purposes and ordered that interested stakeholders file comments on the report by May 22, 2023, which deadline was extended until July 31, 2023. JCP&L and one other party filed comments on July 31, 2023.\nOn September 17, 2021, in connection with Mid-Atlantic Offshore Development, LLC, a transmission company jointly owned by Shell New Energies US and EDF Renewables North America, JCP&L submitted a proposal to the NJBPU and PJM to build transmission infrastructure connecting offshore wind-generated electricity to the New Jersey power grid. On October 26, 2022, the JCP&L proposal was accepted, in part, in an order issued by NJBPU. The proposal, as accepted, included approximately $723 million in investments for JCP&L to both build new and upgrade existing transmission infrastructure. JCP&L’s proposal projects an investment ROE of 10.2% and includes the option for JCP&L to acquire up to a 20% equity stake in Mid-Atlantic Offshore Development, LLC. The resulting rates associated with the project are expected to be shared among the ratepayers of all New Jersey electric utilities. On April 17, 2023, JCP&L applied for the FERC “abandonment” transmission rates incentive, which would provide for recovery of 100% of the cancelled prudent project costs that are incurred after the incentive is approved, and 50% of the costs incurred prior to that date, in the event that some or all of the project is cancelled for reasons beyond JCP&L’s control. On August 21, 2023, FERC approved JCP&L’s application, effective August 22, 2023. On October 31, 2023, offshore wind developer, Orsted, announced plans to cease development of two offshore wind projects in New Jersey—Ocean Wind 1 and 2—having a combined planned capacity of 2,248 MWs. Orsted’s cancellation does not affect JCP&L’s awarded projects and JCP&L is moving forward with preconstruction activities for the planned transmission infrastructure. Construction is expected to begin in 2025. \nConsistent with the commitments made in its proposal to the NJBPU, JCP&L formally submitted in November 2023 the first part of its application to the DOE to finance a substantial portion of the project using low-interest rate loans available under the DOE’s \n71\nEnergy Infrastructure Reinvestment Program of the IRA of 2022. JCP&L submitted the second part of its two-part application on March 13, 2024, which was approved on May 17, 2024. The DOE Loan Program Office has initiated a due diligence review of the application.\nOn November 9, 2023, JCP&L filed a petition for approval of its EnergizeNJ with the NJBPU that would, among other things, support grid modernization, system resiliency and substation modernization in technologies designed to provide enhanced customer benefits. JCP&L proposes EnergizeNJ will be implemented over a five-year budget period with estimated costs of approximately $935 million over the deployment period, of which, $906 million is capital investments and $29 million is operating and maintenance expenses. Under the proposal, the capital costs of EnergizeNJ would be recovered through JCP&L’s base rates via annual and semi-annual base rate adjustment filings. The 2023 base rate case stipulation that was filed on February 2, 2024, necessitated amendments to the EnergizeNJ program. On February 14, 2024, the NJBPU approved the stipulated settlement between JCP&L and various parties, resolving JCP&L’s request for a distribution base rate increase. On February 27, 2024, as part of the stipulated settlement, JCP&L amended its pending EnergizeNJ petition following receipt of NJBPU approval of the base rate case settlement, to remove the high-priority circuits that are to be addressed in the first phase of its reliability improvement plan and to include the second phase of its reliability improvement plan that is expected to further address certain high-priority circuits that require additional upgrades. EnergizeNJ, if approved as amended, will result in the investment of approximately $930.5 million of total estimated costs over five years. JCP&L and various parties are engaged in settlement discussions with respect to the pending EnergizeNJ petition.\nOHIO\nThe Ohio Companies operate under PUCO-approved base distribution rates that became effective in 2009. The Ohio Companies operated under ESP IV through May 31, 2024, which provided for the supply of power to non-shopping customers at a market-based price set through an auction process. From June 1, 2024 until January 31, 2025, the Ohio Companies operated under ESP V, as modified by the PUCO, and as further described below. On December 18, 2024, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies’ notice to withdraw ESP V and approved the Ohio Companies’ proposal for returning to ESP IV, with modifications. ESP IV, as modified, continues the DCR rider, which supports continued investment related to the distribution system for the benefit of customers, with an annual revenue cap of $390 million. In addition, ESP IV, as modified, includes: (1) continuation of a base distribution rate freeze until ESP VI becomes effective or the Ohio Companies’ obtain the PUCO’s staff agreement; (2) a goal across FirstEnergy to reduce CO2 emissions by 90% below 2005 levels by 2045; and (3) contributions, totaling $6.39 million per year to: (a) fund energy conservation, economic development and job retention programs in the Ohio Companies’ service territories; and (b) establish fuel-funds in each of the Ohio Companies’ service territories to assist low-income customers.\nOn April 5, 2023, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO for approval of ESP V, for an eight-year term beginning June 1, 2024, and continuing through May 31, 2032. On May 15, 2024, the PUCO issued an order approving ESP V with modifications, which became effective June 1, 2024 and would have continued through May 31, 2029. ESP V, as modified by the PUCO, provided for, among other things, the continuation of existing riders related to purchased power, transmission and uncollectibles, the continuation of the DCR rider with proposed annual revenue cap increases until new base rates are established, the continuation of the AMI rider, and the addition of new riders for recovery of storm and vegetation management expenses. Many of the terms and conditions were to be reconsidered in the base rate case. The ESP V order additionally directed the Ohio Companies to file another base distribution rate case not later than May 31, 2028, and contribute $32.5 million during the term of ESP V to fund low-income customer bill assistance programs and bill assistance for income-eligible senior citizens, and to develop an electric vehicle education program to assist customers in transitioning to electric vehicles which was recognized in the second quarter of 2024 within “Other operating expenses” at the Regulated Distribution segment and on FirstEnergy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Due to the risks and uncertainty resulting from the Ohio Companies’ application for rehearing being denied by operation of law, on October 29, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed a notice of their intent to withdraw ESP V and proposed the terms under which they would resume operating under ESP IV. On December 18, 2024, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies’ notice of withdrawal. Also on December 18, 2024, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies’ proposal for returning to ESP IV, with modifications. Consistent with ESP IV, the PUCO authorized the Ohio Companies’ reinstatement of the DCR rider, with an annual revenue cap of $390 million, and denied the Ohio Companies’ request to continue ESP IV’s DCR rider revenue cap increases of $15 million per year. Additionally, the PUCO ordered that storm costs deferred under ESP V since June 1, 2024 remain on the Ohio Companies’ books and subject to review in a future case. The PUCO also denied the Ohio Companies’ request to lift the base rate freeze in ESP IV, permitting the Ohio Companies’ pending base rate case to continue, but prohibiting new rates from going into effect until either the effective date of ESP VI, or the staff agrees that the freeze be lifted and new rates be implemented. On January 22, 2025, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies’ revised ESP IV tariffs, effective February 1, 2025, at which time the Ohio Companies resumed operating under ESP IV. \nOn January 31, 2025, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO for ESP VI, for a term beginning on the date new base distribution rates from the pending base rate case go into effect, in an effort to align with the ongoing base distribution rate case, and continuing through May 31, 2028. ESP VI proposes to continue providing power to non-shopping customers at market-based prices set through an auction process, and proposes to continue riders supporting investment in the Ohio Companies’ distribution system, including Rider DCR with annual reliability performance-based revenue cap increases of $37 to $43 million, and an AMI rider for recovery of approved grid modernization investments. ESP VI additionally proposes riders to support continued maintenance of the distribution system, including recovery of vegetation management and storm restoration \n72\noperations and maintenance expenses. In addition, ESP VI proposes energy efficiency programs for low-income customers, and includes a commitment to spend $6.5 million annually over the ESP VI term, without recovery from customers, on initiatives to assist low-income customers, as well as education and incentives to help ensure customers have good experiences with electric vehicles. The PUCO has scheduled a technical conference for March 12, 2025.\nOn May 31, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed their application for an increase in base distribution rates based on a 2024 calendar year test period. The Ohio Companies requested a net increase in base distribution revenues of approximately $94 million compared to test period revenues, with a return on equity of 10.8% and capital structures of 44% debt and 56% equity for CEI, 46% debt and 54% equity for OE, and 45% debt and 55% equity for TE, which reflects a roll-in of current riders such as DCR and AMI. Key components of the base rate case filing include a proposal to change pension and OPEB recovery to the delayed recognition method and to implement a mechanism to establish a regulatory asset (or liability) to recover (or refund) net differences between the amount of pension and OPEB expense requested in the proceeding and the actual amount each year using this method. Additionally, the Ohio Companies request recovery of certain incurred costs, including the impact of major storms, a program to convert streetlights to LEDs, and others. On June 14, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed supporting testimony. On July 31, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed an update that adjusted the net increase in base distribution revenues to approximately $190 million compared to test period revenues and incorporated matters in the rate case as directed by the PUCO’s ESP V order. On January 27, 2025, the Ohio Companies filed a notice in the base rate case notifying parties that they will update their application for an increase in base distribution rates to reflect the withdrawal of ESP V and the reversion to ESP IV. The PUCO Staff hired a third party to assist in the review of the Ohio Companies' base rate case filing, and on February 21, 2025, PUCO staff and the third party auditor each filed their reports. The auditor’s report recommended adjustments which would result in a net increase of the Ohio Companies’ base distribution revenues of approximately $8 million with a return on equity of 9.63% and capital structures of 48.8% debt and 51.2% equity for each of the Ohio Companies. PUCO staff’s report takes limited positions on the auditor’s finding and recommendations and makes additional findings. The Ohio Companies plan to respond and file supplemental testimony by March 24, 2025.\nOn May 16, 2022, May 15, 2023, and May 15, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed their SEET applications for determination of the existence of significantly excessive earnings under ESP IV for calendar years 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. Each application demonstrated that each of the individual Ohio Companies did not have significantly excessive earnings. These matters remain pending before the PUCO.\nOn July 15, 2022, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO for approval of phase two of their distribution grid modernization plan that would, among other things, provide for the installation of an additional 700 thousand smart meters, distribution automation equipment on approximately 240 distribution circuits, voltage regulating equipment on approximately 220 distribution circuits, and other investments and pilot programs in related technologies designed to provide enhanced customer benefits. The Ohio Companies proposed that phase two would be implemented over a four-year budget period with estimated capital investments of approximately $626 million and operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $144 million over the deployment period. Under the proposal, costs of phase two of the grid modernization plan would be recovered through the Ohio Companies’ AMI rider, pursuant to the terms and conditions approved in ESP IV. On April 12, 2024, the Ohio Companies and certain of the parties filed a stipulation that modified the Ohio Companies’ application for phase two of its grid modernization plan, which was approved by the PUCO on December 18, 2024 and implementation has since begun. The stipulation provides for the deployment of smart meters to the balance of the Ohio Companies’ customers or approximately 1.4 million meters. Phase two of the distribution grid modernization plan, as modified by the stipulation, would be completed over a four-year budget period with estimated capital investments of approximately $421 million.\nOn September 8, 2020, the OCC filed motions in the Ohio Companies’ corporate separation audit and DMR audit dockets, requesting the PUCO to open an investigation and management audit, hire an independent auditor, and require FirstEnergy to show it did not improperly use money collected from consumers or violate any utility regulatory laws, rules or orders in its activities regarding HB 6. On December 30, 2020, in response to the OCC's motion, the PUCO reopened the DMR audit docket, and directed PUCO staff to solicit a third-party auditor and conduct a full review of the DMR to ensure funds collected from customers through the DMR were only used for the purposes established in ESP IV. On June 2, 2021, the PUCO selected an auditor, and the auditor filed the final audit report on January 14, 2022, which made certain findings and recommendations. The report found that spending of DMR revenues was not required to be tracked, and that DMR revenues, like all rider revenues, are placed into the regulated money pool as a matter of routine, where the funds lose their identity. Therefore, the report could not suggest that DMR funds were used definitively for direct or indirect support for grid modernization. The report also concluded that there was no documented evidence that ties revenues from the DMR to lobbying for the passage of HB 6, but also could not rule out with certainty uses of DMR funds to support the passage of HB 6. The report further recommended that the regulated companies' money pool be audited more frequently and the Ohio Companies adopt formal dividend policies. Final comments and responses were filed by parties during the second quarter of 2022. The proceeding was stayed in its entirety, including discovery and motions, continuously at the request of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio beginning in August 2022 and was lifted on February 26, 2024. On February 26, 2024, the Attorney Examiner consolidated this proceeding with the expanded DCR rider audit proceeding described below and on November 22, 2024, the administrative law judge ordered that the bifurcated portion of the corporate separation audit, discussed further below, be consolidated with the already-consolidated DMR audit and expanded DCR rider audit proceeding. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin May 13, 2025.\n73\nOn September 15, 2020, the PUCO opened a new proceeding to review the political and charitable spending by the Ohio Companies in support of HB 6 and the subsequent referendum effort, and directed the Ohio Companies to show cause, demonstrating that the costs of any political or charitable spending in support of HB 6, or the subsequent referendum effort, were not included, directly or indirectly, in any rates or charges paid by customers. The Ohio Companies initially filed a response stating that the costs of any political or charitable spending in support of HB 6, or the subsequent referendum effort, were not included, directly or indirectly, in any rates or charges paid by customers, but on August 6, 2021, filed a supplemental response explaining that, in light of the facts set forth in the DPA and the findings of the DCR rider audit report further discussed below, political or charitable spending in support of HB 6, or the subsequent referendum effort, affected pole attachment rates paid by approximately $15 thousand. On October 26, 2021, the OCC filed a motion requesting the PUCO to order an independent external audit to investigate FE’s political and charitable spending related to HB 6, and to appoint an independent review panel to retain and oversee the auditor. In November and December 2021, parties filed comments and reply comments regarding the Ohio Companies’ original and supplemental responses to the PUCO’s September 15, 2020, show cause directive. On May 4, 2022, the PUCO selected a third-party auditor to determine whether the show cause demonstration submitted by the Ohio Companies is sufficient to ensure that the cost of any political or charitable spending in support of HB 6 or the subsequent referendum effort was not included, directly or indirectly, in any rates or charges paid by ratepayers. The proceeding was stayed in its entirety, including discovery and motions, continuously at the request of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio beginning in August 2022 and the stay was lifted on February 26, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the third-party auditor’s report was filed. The audit examined 53 payments totaling approximately $75 million made in support of the passage of HB 6 and subsequent referendum efforts, and concluded that less than $5 million was allocated to the Ohio Companies. The audit report affirmed the Ohio Companies’ conclusion in its August 6, 2021 filing that a rate impact of less than $15 thousand was charged to the Ohio Companies’ pole attachment customers associated with political and charitable spending in support of HB 6. On October 22, 2024, parties filed comments on the audit report, and on November 5, 2024, parties filed reply comments. The parties' comments remain pending with the PUCO.\nIn connection with an ongoing audit of the Ohio Companies’ policies and procedures relating to the code of conduct rules between affiliates, on November 4, 2020, the PUCO initiated an additional corporate separation audit as a result of the FirstEnergy leadership transition announcement made on October 29, 2020, as further discussed below. The additional audit is to ensure compliance by the Ohio Companies and their affiliates with corporate separation laws and the Ohio Companies’ corporate separation plan. The additional audit is for the period from November 2016 through October 2020. The final audit report was filed on September 13, 2021. The audit report makes no findings of major non-compliance with Ohio corporate separation requirements, minor non-compliance with eight requirements, and findings of compliance with 23 requirements. Parties filed comments and reply comments on the audit report. The proceeding was stayed in its entirety, including discovery and motions, continuously at the request of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio beginning in August 2022 and the stay was lifted on February 26, 2024. On September 10, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed testimony describing their compliance with Ohio corporate separation laws and the implementation of the recommendations made in the audit reports. On September 20, 2024, intervenors filed testimony recommending fines for alleged violations of the Ohio corporate separation requirements. Evidentiary hearings were held on October 9 and 10, 2024; the scope of the hearings excluded allegations involving activities related to the passage of HB 6 and the former PUCO chairman, which will be addressed at a later time. Initial and reply briefs have been filed by the Ohio Companies, PUCO staff and the intervening parties. To the extent the PUCO ultimately accepts the intervenors’ recommendations and issues a fine to the Ohio Companies, such amount is not expected to be material.\nOn September 3, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed an application to amend their corporate separation plan to incorporate certain recommendations from prior audit reports, which include, but are not limited to, improving controls for non-regulated competitive employees’ physical space and access to data, updating and implementing a process to annually review the cost allocation manual, developing state specific codes of conduct practices, and implementing additional training related to the cost allocation manual and the state codes of conduct. On October 23, 2024, the administrative law judge issued an entry suspending automatic approval of the amended corporate separation plan and establishing a procedural schedule. \nIn connection with an ongoing annual audit of the Ohio Companies’ DCR rider for 2020, and as a result of disclosures in FirstEnergy’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed on February 18, 2021), the PUCO expanded the scope of the audit on March 10, 2021, to include a review of certain transactions that were either improperly classified, misallocated, or lacked supporting documentation, and to determine whether funds collected from customers were used to pay the vendors, and if so, whether or not the funds associated with those payments should be returned to customers through the DCR rider or through an alternative proceeding. On August 3, 2021, the auditor filed its final report on this phase of the audit, and the parties submitted comments and reply comments on this audit report in October 2021. Additionally, on September 29, 2021, the PUCO expanded the scope of the audit in this proceeding to determine if the costs of the naming rights for FirstEnergy Stadium have been recovered from the Ohio Companies’ customers. On November 19, 2021, the auditor filed its final report, in which the auditor concluded that the FirstEnergy Stadium naming rights expenses were not recovered from Ohio customers. On December 15, 2021, the PUCO further expanded the scope of the audit to include an investigation into an apparent nondisclosure of a side agreement in the Ohio Companies’ ESP IV settlement proceedings, but stayed its expansion of the audit until otherwise ordered by the PUCO. The proceeding was stayed in its entirety, including discovery and motions, continuously at the request of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio beginning in August 2022 and the stay was lifted on February 26, 2024. On February 26, 2024, the Attorney Examiner consolidated this proceeding with the Rider DMR audit proceeding described above, and further lifted the stay of the portion of the investigation relating to an apparent nondisclosure of a side agreement. On November 22, 2024, the administrative law judge ordered that the bifurcated portion of the corporate separation audit be consolidated with the \n74\nalready-consolidated DMR audit and the expanded DCR rider audit proceeding. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin May 13, 2025.\nOn September 22, 2023, OCC filed an application for rehearing challenging the PUCO’s August 23, 2023, order to stay the pending HB 6 related matters above, which the PUCO denied on October 18, 2023. On November 17, 2023, OCC filed an application for rehearing challenging the October 18, 2023 entry to the extent the PUCO decided not to stay pending proceedings regarding ESP V as well as phases one and two of the Ohio Companies’ distribution grid modernization plans. On November 27, 2023, the Ohio Companies filed a memorandum contra OCC’s application for rehearing. As the PUCO did not rule on OCC’s November 17, 2023 application for rehearing within 30 days of filing, the application for rehearing was denied by operation of law.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, motions were filed with the PUCO requesting that the PUCO amend the Ohio Companies’ riders for collecting the OVEC-related charges required by HB 6 to provide for refunds in the event such provisions of HB 6 are repealed. Neither the Ohio Companies nor FE benefit from the OVEC-related charges the Ohio Companies collect. Instead, the Ohio Companies are further required by HB 6 to remit all the OVEC-related charges they collect to non-FE Ohio electric distribution utilities. The Ohio Companies contested the motions, which are pending before the PUCO.\nSee “Outlook - Other Legal Proceedings” below for additional details on the government investigations and subsequent litigation surrounding the investigation of HB 6.\nPENNSYLVANIA\nOn January 1, 2024, each of the Pennsylvania Companies merged with and into FE PA. As a result of the PA Consolidation, FE PA has five rate districts in Pennsylvania – four that correspond to the territories previously serviced by ME, PN, Penn, and WP and one rate district that corresponds to WP’s service provided to The Pennsylvania State University. The rate districts created by the PA Consolidation will not reach full rate unity until the earlier of 2033 or the conclusion of three base rate cases filed after January 1, 2025. FE PA operates under rates approved by the PPUC, effective as of January 1, 2025, as further discussed below.\nPursuant to Pennsylvania Act 129 of 2008 and PPUC orders, the Pennsylvania Companies implemented energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs with demand reduction targets, relative to 2007-2008 peak demands, at 2.9% MW for ME, 3.3% MW for PN, 2.0% MW for Penn, and 2.5% MW for WP; and energy consumption reduction targets, as a percentage of the Pennsylvania Companies’ historic 2009 to 2010 reference load at 3.1% MWh for ME, 3.0% MWh for PN, 2.7% MWh for Penn, and 2.4% MWh for WP. The fourth phase of FE PA’s energy efficiency and peak demand reduction program, which runs for the five-year period beginning June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2026, was approved by the PPUC on June 18, 2020, providing through cost recovery of approximately $390 million to be recovered through Energy Efficiency and Conservation Phase IV Riders for each FE PA rate district.\nPennsylvania EDCs are permitted to seek PPUC approval of an LTIIP for accelerated infrastructure improvements and costs related to highway relocation projects, after which a DSIC may be approved to recover LTIIP costs. On January 16, 2020, the PPUC approved the Pennsylvania Companies’ LTIIPs for the five-year period beginning January 1, 2020 and ending December 31, 2024 for a total capital investment of approximately $572 million for certain infrastructure improvement initiatives. On July 22, 2024, FE PA filed its application with the PPUC seeking approval for the next phase of its LTIIP program, which is expected to result in approximately $1.6 billion in investments, with approximately $1.4 billion of such investments going in service during the five-year period beginning January 1, 2025 and ending December 31, 2029. The PPUC approved FE PA’s application on December 19, 2024, and implementation began in January 2025.\nOn May 5, 2023, FirstEnergy and Brookfield submitted applications to FERC and to the PPUC to facilitate the FET Equity Interest Sale. On May 12, 2023, the parties also filed an application with the VSCC, which was approved on June 20, 2023. On August 14, 2023, FERC issued an order approving the FET Equity Interest Sale. On November 24, 2023, CFIUS notified FET, Brookfield and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as an indirect investor in FET through Brookfield, that it had determined that there were no unresolved national security issues and its review of the transaction was concluded. On November 29, 2023, the parties filed a settlement agreement recommending that the PPUC approve the transaction subject to the terms of the settlement, which includes among other things, a number of ring-fencing provisions and a commitment to improve transmission reliability over the next five years. The settlement was approved by the PPUC on March 14, 2024. The transaction closed on March 25, 2024.\nOn April 2, 2024, FE PA filed a base rate case with the PPUC, based on a projected 2025 annual test year. The rate case requested a net increase in base distribution revenues of approximately $502 million with a return on equity of 11.3% and capital structure of 46.2% debt and 53.8% equity, and reflected a roll-in of several current riders such as DSIC, Tax Act and smart meter. The increase represented an overall net average rate increase in FE PA rates by approximately 7.7%, and a 10.5% average residential rate increase. Key components of the base rate case filing included a proposal to change pension recovery from average cash contributions to the delayed recognition method and to implement a mechanism to establish a regulatory asset (or liability) to recover (or refund) net differences between the amount of pension expense requested in the proceeding and the actual annual amount each year using this method. Additionally, FE PA requested an enhanced ten-year vegetation management \n75\nprogram and recovery of certain incurred costs, including major storms, COVID-19, a program to convert streetlights to LEDs, and others. On September 13, 2024, FE PA and the active parties to the proceeding filed a joint settlement agreement requesting that the administrative law judges to approve FE PA’s requested distribution base rate case increase subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement, which included, among other things, an annual net revenue increase of $225 million. Other key components of the settlement agreement included recovery of costs incurred for storms and COVID-19, additional cost recovery of ongoing storm costs, inspection and maintenance of overhead lines and transformers, and rate case expenses, as well as an enhanced vegetation management program. On October 15, 2024, the administrative law judges issued a decision recommending that the PPUC approve, without modification, the September 13, 2024 settlement agreement. On November 21, 2024, the PPUC unanimously approved the settlement agreement without modification. New rates became effective on January 1, 2025.\nWEST VIRGINIA\nMP and PE provide electric service to all customers through traditional cost-based, regulated utility ratemaking and operate under WVPSC-approved rates. MP and PE recover net power supply costs, including fuel costs, purchased power costs and related expenses, net of related market sales revenue through the ENEC. MP’s and PE’s ENEC rate is typically updated annually.\nOn August 31, 2023, MP and PE filed with the WVPSC their annual ENEC case requesting an increase in ENEC rates of $167.5 million beginning January 1, 2024, which represented a 9.9% increase in overall rates. This increase, which was driven primarily by higher fuel expenses, included the approximate $92 million carried over from the 2022 ENEC proceeding and a portion of the approximately $267 million under recovery balance at the end of the review period (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023). The remaining $75.6 million of the under recovery balance not recovered in 2024 was to be deferred for collection during 2025, with an annual carrying charge of 4%. A hearing was held on November 30, 2023, at which time a joint stipulation for settlement that was agreed to by all but one party was presented to the WVPSC. The settlement provided for a net $55.4 million increase in ENEC rates beginning March 27, 2024 with the net deferred ENEC balance of approximately $184 million to be recovered from 2025 through 2026. There will be no 2024 ENEC case unless MP and PE over or under recover by more than $50 million from January through June 2024 and a party elects to invoke a case filing, neither of which occurred. An order was issued on March 26, 2024 approving the settlement without modification and rates became effective on March 27, 2024. MP and PE will file their next ENEC filing on or before September 1, 2025.\nOn April 21, 2022, the WVPSC issued an order approving, effective May 1, 2022, a tariff to offer solar power on a voluntary basis to West Virginia customers and requiring MP and PE to subscribe at least 85% of the planned 50 MWs of solar generation before seeking approval for surcharge cost recovery. MP and PE must seek separate approval from the WVPSC to recover any solar generation costs in excess of the approved solar power tariff. On April 24, 2023, MP and PE sought approval for surcharge cost recovery from the WVPSC for three of the five solar sites, representing 30 MWs of generation. On August 23, 2023, the WVPSC approved the customer surcharge and granted approval to construct three of the five solar sites. The surcharge went into effect January 1, 2024. The first solar generation site went into service in January 2024 and the second solar generation site went into service in September 2024. On December 4, 2024, MP and PE submitted for approval a settlement agreement to increase its solar surcharge rate. The WVPSC approved the settlement without modification on December 27, 2024 and new rates went into effect on January 1, 2025.\nOn January 13, 2023, MP and PE filed a request with the WVPSC seeking approval of new depreciation rates for existing and future capital assets. Specifically, MP and PE were seeking to increase depreciation expense by approximately $76 million per year, primarily for regulated generation-related assets. Any depreciation rates approved by the WVPSC would not become effective until new base rates were established. On August 22, 2023, a unanimous settlement of the case was filed recommending a $33 million per year increase in depreciation expense, effective April 1, 2024. An order from the WVPSC was issued on March 26, 2024 approving the settlement without modification and new depreciation rates became effective on April 1, 2024.\nOn May 31, 2023, MP and PE filed a base rate case with the WVPSC requesting a total revenue increase of approximately $207 million utilizing a test year of 2022 with adjustments plus a request to establish a regulatory asset (or liability) to recover (or refund) in a subsequent base rate case the net differences between the amount of pension and OPEB expense requested in the proceeding (based on average expense from 2018 to 2022) and the actual annual amount each year using the delayed recognition method. Among other things, the increase included the approximate $75 million requested in a depreciation case filed on January 13, 2023 and described above, and amounts to support a new low-income customer advocacy program, storm restoration work and service reliability investments. On January 23, 2024, MP, PE and various parties filed a joint settlement agreement with the WVPSC, which recommended a base rate increase of $105 million, inclusive of the $33 million increase in depreciation expense, but deferred issues related to a change in the net energy metering credit. Additionally, the settlement included a new low-income customer advocacy program, a pilot program for service reliability investments and recovery of costs related to storm restoration, retired generation assets and COVID-19. The settlement did not include the request to establish a regulatory asset (or liability) for recovery (or refund) associated with pension and OPEB expense, however, it did not preclude MP and PE from pursuing that in a future separate proceeding. On February 16, 2024, interested parties filed a settlement on the net energy metering credit for consideration by the WVPSC. An order was issued on March 26, 2024 approving the $105 million increase and accepting the settlements with slight non-material modifications with new rates going into effect on March 27, 2024. \n76\nAdditionally, due to the order including approval by the WVPSC to recover certain costs associated with retired generation assets, MP recognized a $60 million pre-tax benefit in the first quarter of 2024 to establish a regulatory asset. See “Outlook - Environmental Matters - Clean Water Act\" below, for additional details on the EPA's ELG.\nFERC REGULATORY MATTERS\nUnder the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates rates for interstate wholesale sales and transmission of electric power, regulatory accounting and reporting under the Uniform System of Accounts, and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects. With respect to their wholesale services and rates, the Electric Companies, AE Supply and the Transmission Companies are subject to regulation by FERC. FERC regulations require JCP&L, MP, PE and the Transmission Companies to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, terms and conditions. Transmission facilities of JCP&L, MP, PE and the Transmission Companies are subject to functional control by PJM and transmission service using their transmission facilities is provided by PJM under the PJM Tariff. On January 1, 2024, WP transferred certain of its Pennsylvania-based transmission assets to KATCo.\nThe following table summarizes the key terms of FERC rate orders in effect for transmission customer billings for FirstEnergy's transmission owner entities as of December 31, 2024:\nCompany\nRates Effective\nCapital Structure\nAllowed ROE\nATSI\nJanuary 2015\nActual (13-month average)\n9.88%\n(1)\nJCP&L\nJanuary 2020\nActual (13-month average)\n10.20%\nMP\nJanuary 2021\nLower of Actual (13-month average) or 56% equity\n10.45%\nPE \nJanuary 2021\nLower of Actual (13-month average) or 56% equity\n10.45%\nKATCo\n(2)\nJanuary 2021\nHypothetical 49.3% equity\n(3)\n10.45%\nMAIT\nJuly 2017\nLower of Actual (13-month average) or 60%\n10.3%\nTrAIL\nJuly 2008\nActual (year-end)\n12.7%\n(2) \n/ 11.7%\n(3)\n(1) \nReflects a 0.5% reduction to the 10.38% approved ROE due to the January 2025 Sixth Circuit ruling eliminating the 50 basis point adder associated with RTO membership (see \nTransmission ROE Incentive: OCC v.

The Electric Companies and AE Supply each have the necessary authorization from FERC to sell their wholesale power, if any, in interstate commerce at market-based rates, although in the case of the Electric Companies major wholesale purchases remain subject to review and regulation by the relevant state commissions.\nFederally enforceable mandatory reliability standards apply to the bulk electric system and impose certain operating, record-keeping and reporting requirements on the Electric Companies, AE Supply, and the Transmission Companies. NERC is the Electric Reliability Organization designated by FERC to establish and enforce these reliability standards, although NERC has delegated day-to-day implementation and enforcement of these reliability standards to six regional entities, including RFC. All of the facilities that FirstEnergy operates are located within the RFC region. FirstEnergy actively participates in the NERC and RFC stakeholder processes, and otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to the ongoing development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability standards implemented and enforced by RFC.\nFirstEnergy believes that it is in material compliance with all currently effective and enforceable reliability standards. Nevertheless, in the course of operating its extensive electric utility systems and facilities, FirstEnergy occasionally learns of isolated facts or circumstances that could be interpreted as excursions from the reliability standards. If and when such occurrences are found, FirstEnergy develops information about the occurrence and develops a remedial response to the specific circumstances, including in appropriate cases “self-reporting” an occurrence to RFC. Moreover, it is clear that NERC, RFC and FERC will continue to refine existing reliability standards as well as to develop and adopt new reliability standards. Any inability on FirstEnergy’s part to comply with the reliability standards for its bulk electric system could result in the imposition of financial penalties, or obligations to upgrade or build transmission facilities, that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n77\nFERC Audit\nFERC’s Division of Audits and Accounting initiated a nonpublic audit of FESC in February 2019. Among other matters, the audit is evaluating FirstEnergy’s compliance with certain accounting and reporting requirements under various FERC regulations. On February 4, 2022, FERC filed the final audit report for the period of January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2021, which included several findings and recommendations that FirstEnergy has accepted. The audit report included a finding and related recommendation on FirstEnergy’s methodology for allocation of certain corporate support costs to regulatory capital accounts under certain FERC regulations and reporting. Effective in the first quarter of 2022 and in response to the finding, FirstEnergy had implemented a new methodology for the allocation of these corporate support costs to regulatory capital accounts for its regulated distribution and transmission companies on a prospective basis. With the assistance of an independent outside firm, FirstEnergy completed an analysis during the third quarter of 2022 of these costs and how it impacted certain FERC-jurisdictional wholesale transmission customer rates for the audit period of 2015 through 2021. As a result of this analysis, FirstEnergy recorded in the third quarter of 2022 approximately $45 million ($34 million after-tax) in expected customer refunds, plus interest, due to its wholesale transmission customers and reclassified approximately $195 million of certain transmission capital assets to operating expenses for the audit period, of which $90 million ($67 million after-tax) are not expected to be recoverable and impacted FirstEnergy’s earnings since they relate to costs capitalized during stated transmission rate time periods. FirstEnergy has recovered approximately $105 million of costs reclassified to operating expenses in its transmission formula rate revenue requirements as of December 31, 2024. These reclassifications also resulted in a reduction to the Stand-Alone Transmission segment’s rate base by approximately $160 million, which is not expected to materially impact FirstEnergy or the segment’s future earnings. The expected wholesale transmission customer refunds were recognized as a reduction to revenue, and the amount of reclassified transmission capital assets that are not expected to be recoverable were recognized within “Other operating expenses” at the Stand-Alone Transmission segment and on FirstEnergy’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Furthermore, the Ohio Companies are in the process of addressing the outcomes of the FERC Audit with the PUCO, which includes seeking continued rate base treatment of approximately $100 million of certain corporate support costs allocated to distribution capital assets in Ohio.\nOn December 8, 2023, FERC audit staff issued a letter advising that two unresolved audit matters, primarily related to FirstEnergy’s plan to recover the reclassified operating expenses in formula transmission rates, were being referred to other offices within FERC for further review. On July 5, 2024 and September 26, 2024, the FERC Office of Enforcement issued additional data requests related to the 2022 reclassification of operating expenses, to which FirstEnergy replied. On September 10, 2024, the FERC Office of Enforcement issued a set of data requests related to the classification and recovery of a since terminated fuel consulting contract, to which FirstEnergy responded. The FERC Office of Enforcement issued another set of data requests related to the same fuel consulting contract on January 13, 2025. Responses are due March 5, 2025. If the FERC Office of Energy Market Regulation and the FERC Office of Enforcement were to successfully challenge the recovery of the 2022 reclassified operating expenses and formula transmission rates it could have material adverse effect on FirstEnergy financial conditions, result of operations, and cash flows. \nTransmission ROE Incentive: OCC v. ATSI, et al.\nOn February 24, 2022, the OCC filed a complaint with FERC against ATSI, AEP’s Ohio affiliates and American Electric Power Service Corporation, and Duke Energy Ohio, LLC asserting that FERC should reduce the ROE utilized in the utilities’ transmission formula rates by eliminating the 50 basis point adder associated with RTO membership, effective February 24, 2022. The OCC contends that this result is required because Ohio law mandates that transmission owning utilities join an RTO and that the 50 basis point adder is applicable only where RTO membership is voluntary. On December 15, 2022, FERC denied the complaint as to ATSI and Duke, but granted it as to AEP. AEP and OCC appealed FERC’s orders to the Sixth Circuit. On January 17, 2025, the Sixth Circuit ruled that the 50 basis point adder is available only where RTO membership is voluntary, that Ohio law requires Ohio’s transmission utilities to be members of an RTO, and that it was unlawful for FERC to excise the adder from AEP rates, but not from the Duke and ATSI rates. FirstEnergy expects to pursue further appeal. During the fourth quarter of 2024, ATSI recognized a $46 million pre-tax charge, with interest, of which $42 million is reported in “Transmission Revenues” and $4 million is reported in “Miscellaneous income, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Income at the Stand-Alone Transmission segment to reflect the expected refund owed to transmission customers back to February 24, 2022. \n78\nTransmission ROE Methodology\nA proposed rulemaking proceeding concerning transmission rate incentives provisions of Section 219 of the 2005 Energy Policy Act was initiated in March of 2020 and remains pending before FERC. Among other things, the rulemaking explored whether utilities should collect an “RTO membership” ROE incentive adder for more than three years. FirstEnergy is a member of PJM, and its transmission subsidiaries could be affected by the proposed rulemaking. FirstEnergy participated in comments on the supplemental rulemaking that were submitted by a group of PJM transmission owners and by various industry trade groups. If there were to be any changes to FirstEnergy's transmission incentive ROE, such changes will be applied on a prospective basis.\nTransmission Planning Supplemental Projects: Ohio Consumers Counsel v ATSI, et al. \nOn September 27, 2023, the OCC filed a complaint against ATSI, PJM and other transmission utilities in Ohio alleging that the PJM Tariff and operating agreement are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory because they include no provisions to ensure PJM’s review and approval for the planning, need, prudence and cost-effectiveness of the PJM Tariff Attachment M-3 “Supplemental Projects.” Supplemental Projects are projects that are planned and constructed to address local needs on the transmission system. The OCC demands that FERC: (i) require PJM to review supplemental projects for need, prudence and cost-effectiveness; (ii) appoint an independent transmission monitor to assist PJM in such review; and (iii) require that Supplemental Projects go into rate base only through a “stated rate” procedure whereby prior FERC approval would be needed for projects with costs that exceed an established threshold. ATSI and the other transmission utilities in Ohio and PJM filed comments and the complaint is pending before FERC.\nLocal Transmission Planning Complaint: Industrial Energy Consumers of America, et al. v. Avista Corporation, et al.\nOn December 19, 2024, the Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a group representing large industrial customers, and state consumer advocates filed a complaint at FERC that asserts that transmission owners are overbuilding “local transmission facilities” with corresponding unjustified increases in transmission rates. The complaint demands that FERC: (i) prohibit transmission owners from planning “local transmission facilities” that are rated at 100kV or higher, (ii) appoint “independent transmission monitors” to conduct such planning, and (iii) condition construction of local transmission facilities on the facility having been planned by the “independent transmission monitor.” FirstEnergy expects to participate in this matter through a consortium of PJM transmission owners and through certain trade groups, including EEI. FirstEnergy is unable to predict the outcome or estimate the impact that this complaint may have on its Transmission Companies, however, whether this lawsuit moves forward could have a material impact on FirstEnergy’s transmission capital investment strategy.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nVarious federal, state and local authorities regulate FirstEnergy with regard to air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, and other environmental matters. While FirstEnergy’s environmental policies and procedures are designed to achieve compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are subject to periodic review and potential revision by the implementing agencies. FirstEnergy cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any of these reviews or how any future actions taken as a result thereof may materially impact its business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \nClean Air Act\nFirstEnergy complies with SO\n2\n and NOx emission reduction requirements under the CAA and SIP by burning lower-sulfur fuel, utilizing combustion controls and post-combustion controls and/or using emission allowances.\nCSAPR requires reductions of NOx and SO\n2\n emissions in two phases (2015 and 2017), ultimately capping SO\n2\n emissions in affected states to 2.4 million tons annually and NOx emissions to 1.2 million tons annually. CSAPR allows trading of NOx and SO\n2\n emission allowances between power plants located in the same state and interstate trading of NOx and SO\n2\n emission allowances with some restrictions. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit ordered the EPA to reconsider the CSAPR caps on NOx and SO\n2\n emissions from power plants in 13 states, including West Virginia. This followed the 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling generally upholding the EPA’s regulatory approach under CSAPR but questioning whether the EPA required upwind states to reduce emissions by more than their contribution to air pollution in downwind states. The EPA issued a CSAPR Update on September 7, 2016, reducing summertime NOx emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern U.S., including West Virginia, beginning in 2017. Various states and other stakeholders appealed the CSAPR Update to the D.C. Circuit in November and December 2016. On September 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit remanded the CSAPR Update to the EPA citing that the rule did not eliminate upwind states’ significant contributions to downwind states’ air quality attainment requirements within applicable attainment deadlines. \nAlso in March 2018, the State of New York filed a CAA Section 126 petition with the EPA alleging that NOx emissions from nine states (including West Virginia) significantly contribute to New York’s inability to attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The petition sought suitable emission rate limits for large stationary sources that are allegedly affecting New York’s air quality within the three years allowed by CAA Section 126. On September 20, 2019, the EPA denied New York’s CAA Section 126 petition. On October 29, 2019, the State of New York appealed the denial of its petition to the D.C. Circuit. On July 14, 2020, \n79\nthe D.C. Circuit reversed and remanded the New York petition to the EPA for further consideration. On March 15, 2021, the EPA issued a revised CSAPR Update that addressed, among other things, the remands of the prior CSAPR Update and the New York Section 126 petition. In December 2021, MP purchased NOx emissions allowances to comply with 2021 ozone season requirements. On April 6, 2022, the EPA published proposed rules seeking to impose further significant reductions in EGU NOx emissions in 25 upwind states, including West Virginia, with the stated purpose of allowing downwind states to attain or maintain compliance with the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. On February 13, 2023, the EPA disapproved 21 SIPs, which was a prerequisite for the EPA to issue a final Good Neighbor Plan or FIP. On June 5, 2023, the EPA issued the final Good Neighbor Plan with an effective date 60 days thereafter. Certain states, including West Virginia, have appealed the disapprovals of their respective SIPs, and some of those states have obtained stays of those disapprovals precluding the Good Neighbor Plan from taking effect in those states. On August 10, 2023, the 4th Circuit granted West Virginia an interim stay of the disapproval of its SIP and on January 10, 2024, after a hearing held on October 27, 2023, granted a full stay which precludes the Good Neighbor Plan from going into effect in West Virginia. In addition to West Virginia, certain other states, and certain trade organizations, including the Midwest Ozone Group of which FE is a member, separately filed petitions for review and motions to stay the Good Neighbor Plan itself at the D.C. Circuit. On September 25, 2023, the D.C. Circuit denied the motions to stay the Good Neighbor Plan. On October 13, 2023, the aggrieved parties filed an Emergency Application for an Immediate Stay of the Good Neighbor Plan with the U.S. Supreme Court. Oral argument was heard on February 21, 2024. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Good Neighbor Plan pending disposition of the petition for review in the D.C. Circuit. On February 6, 2025, the EPA filed a motion at the D.C. Circuit to hold the proceedings in abeyance for 60 days to allow the EPA time to familiarize itself with the Good Neighbor Plan and in particular, time to brief the new administration about these consolidated petitions and the underlying Rule to allow them to decide what action, if any, is necessary.\nClimate Change\nIn recent years, regulators in the U.S. have focused efforts on increasing disclosures by companies related to climate change and mitigation efforts. There are several initiatives to reduce GHG emissions at the state and international level. Certain northeastern states are participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and western states, including California, have implemented programs to control emissions of certain GHGs and enhance public disclosures relating to the same. Additional policies reducing GHG emissions, such as demand reduction programs, renewable portfolio standards and renewable subsidies have been implemented across the nation.\nFirstEnergy has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 with respect to GHGs within FirstEnergy’s direct operational control (known as Scope 1 emissions). Our ability to achieve our GHG reduction goal is subject to our ability to make operational changes and is conditioned upon numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. With respect to our coal-fired plants in West Virginia, which serve as the primary source of our Scope 1 emissions, we have identified that the end of the useful life date is 2035 for Fort Martin and 2040 for Harrison. Determination of the useful life of the regulated coal-fired generation could result in changes in depreciation, and/or continued collection of net plant in rates after retirement, securitization, sale, impairment, or regulatory disallowances. If MP is unable to recover these costs, it could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy’s and/or MP’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. FirstEnergy cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies, including the final SEC climate disclosure rules, which are currently stayed, although potential legislative or regulatory programs restricting CO\n2\n emissions, or litigation alleging damages from GHG emissions, could require material capital and other expenditures or result in changes to its operations.\nIn December 2009, the EPA released its final “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for GHGs under the Clean Air Act,” concluding that concentrations of several key GHGs constitute an “endangerment” and may be regulated as “air pollutants” under the CAA and mandated measurement and reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, including electric generating plants. Subsequently, the EPA released its final CPP regulations in August 2015 to reduce CO\n2\n emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs and finalized separate regulations imposing CO\n2\n emission limits for new, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired EGUs. Numerous states and private parties filed appeals and motions to stay the CPP with the D.C. Circuit in October 2015. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the rule during the pendency of the challenges to the D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court. On March 28, 2017, an executive order, entitled “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth,” instructed the EPA to review the CPP and related rules addressing GHG emissions and suspend, revise or rescind the rules if appropriate. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the CPP and replaced it with the ACE rule that established guidelines for states to develop standards of performance to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired generation. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE rule declaring that the EPA was “arbitrary and capricious” in its rule making and, as such, the ACE rule is no longer in effect and all actions thus far taken by states to implement the federally mandated rule are now null and void. Vacating the ACE rule had the unintended effect of reinstating the CPP because the repeal of the CPP was a provision within the ACE rule. The D.C. Circuit decision was appealed by several states and interested parties, including West Virginia, arguing that the EPA did not have the authorization under Section 111(d) of the CAA to require “generation shifting” as a way to limit GHGs. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court in \nWest Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency\n held that the method the EPA used to regulate GHGs (generation shifting) under Section 111(d) of the CAA (the CPP) was not authorized by Congress and remanded the rule to the EPA for further reconsideration. In response, on May 23, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule pursuant to CAA Section 111 (b) and (d) in line with the decision in \nWest Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency\n intended to reduce power sector GHG emissions (primarily CO\n2\n emissions) from fossil fuel based EGUs. The rule, which proposed stringent GHG emissions limitations based on fuel type and unit retirement date, was issued as final by the EPA on April 25, 2024. In May 2024, a group of 25 states, including West Virginia, filed a challenge to the \n80\nrule in the D.C. Circuit. Also in May 2024, other utility groups, including the Midwest Ozone Group and Electric Generators for a Sensible Transition, both of which MP is a member, filed petitions for review of the GHG rule as well as motions to stay the rule in the D.C. Circuit. On July 19, 2024, the D.C. Circuit denied the stay motions and on July 23 and 26, 2024 the aggrieved petitioners filed emergency stay applications to the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 16, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the stay applications. On December 6, 2024, oral arguments on the merits of the challenge were heard by the D.C. Circuit. On February 5, 2025, the Department of Justice filed an unopposed motion on behalf of EPA in the D.C. Circuit, seeking to hold the litigation in abeyance, and forego issuing its opinion, for a period of 60 days while the new leadership at EPA evaluates the rule and determines how it wishes to proceed On February 19, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA’s motion. Depending on the outcome of any appeals, compliance with these standards could require additional capital expenditures or changes in operation at the Ft. Martin and Harrison power stations.\nClean Water Act\nVarious water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergy’s facilities. In addition, the states in which FirstEnergy operates have water quality standards applicable to FirstEnergy’s operations. \nOn September 30, 2015, the EPA finalized new, more stringent effluent limits for the Steam Electric Power Generating category (40 CFR Part 423) for arsenic, mercury, selenium and nitrogen for wastewater from wet scrubber systems and zero discharge of pollutants in ash transport water. The treatment obligations were to phase-in as permits are renewed on a five-year cycle from 2018 to 2023. However, on April 13, 2017, the EPA granted a Petition for Reconsideration and on September 18, 2017, the EPA postponed certain compliance deadlines for two years. On August 31, 2020, the EPA issued a final rule revising the effluent limits for discharges from wet scrubber systems, retaining the zero-discharge standard for ash transport water, (with some limited discharge allowances), and extending the deadline for compliance to December 31, 2025 for both. In addition, the EPA allows for less stringent limits for sub-categories of generating units based on capacity utilization, flow volume from the scrubber system, and unit retirement date. On March 29, 2023, the EPA published proposed revised ELGs applicable to coal-fired power plants that include more stringent effluent limitations for wet scrubber systems and ash transport water, and new limits on landfill leachate. The rule was issued as final by the EPA on April 25, 2024. On May 30, 2024, the Utility Water Act Group, of which FirstEnergy is a member, filed a Petition for Review of the 2024 ELG Rule with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth and Eighth Circuit Courts, and on June 18, 2024, the Utility Water Group filed a motion to stay the Rule pending disposition on the merits. A number of other parties have challenged the final rule in various petitions for review across several circuits. Those petitions and motions for stay have been consolidated and will be reviewed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit Court. On October 10, 2024, the Eighth Circuit denied the motions for stay. Depending on the outcome of appeals and how final revised rules are ultimately implemented, compliance with these standards could require additional capital expenditures or changes in operation at closed and active landfills, and at the Ft. Martin and Harrison power stations from what was approved by the WVPSC in September 2022 to comply with the 2020 ELG rule. FirstEnergy is currently assessing the impact of the final rule.\nRegulation of Waste Disposal\nFederal and state hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated as a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act. Certain CCRs, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal requirements pending the EPA’s evaluation of the need for future regulation.\nIn April 2015, the EPA finalized regulations for the disposal of CCRs (non-hazardous), establishing national standards for landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to assure the safe disposal of CCRs from electric generating plants. On September 13, 2017, the EPA announced that it would reconsider certain provisions of the final regulations. On July 29, 2020, the EPA published a final rule again revising the date that certain CCR impoundments must cease accepting waste and initiate closure to April 11, 2021. The final rule allowed for an extension of the closure deadline based on meeting identified site-specific criteria. On November 30, 2020, AE Supply submitted a closure deadline extension request to the EPA seeking to extend the cease accepting waste date for the McElroy's Run CCR impoundment facility to October 2024, which request was withdrawn by AE Supply on July 9, 2024, prior to the completion of the technical review by the EPA. As of May 31, 2024, AE Supply ceased accepting waste at the McElroy’s Run CCR impoundment facility from Pleasants Power Station. As of December 31, 2024, AE Supply continues to operate the dry landfill adjacent to McElroy’s Run as a disposal facility for Pleasants Power Station. During the second quarter of 2024, as a result of the evaluation of closure options for McElroy’s Run and the adjacent landfill, AE Supply reviewed its ARO and future expected costs to remediate, resulting in an increase to the ARO liability and corresponding increase to “Other operating expense” of $87 million at Corporate/Other for segment reporting. On February 3, 2025, AE Supply executed an environmental liability transfer agreement with a subsidiary of IDA Power, LLC, whereby AE Supply will transfer the McElroy’s Run CCR impoundment facility and adjacent dry landfill and related remediation obligations. The agreement requires AE Supply to establish a $160 million escrow account that AE Supply will fund over five years. The escrow funding obligation will be secured by a surety bond, which will be guaranteed by FE. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the first quarter of 2025 and the derecognition of the ARO is not expected to have a material impact to FirstEnergy’s financial statements, however, no assurances of the closing of the transfer will be satisfied, including transfer of all required environmental permits.\n81\nOn May 8, 2024, the EPA finalized changes to the CCR regulations addressing inactive surface impoundments at inactive electric utilities, known as legacy CCR surface impoundments. The rule extends 2015 CCR Rule requirements for groundwater monitoring and protection, operational and reporting procedures as well as closure requirements to impoundments and landfills that were not originally included for coverage by the 2015 CCR Rule. Furthermore, the EPA’s interpretations of the EPA CCR regulations continue to evolve through enforcement and other regulatory actions. FirstEnergy is currently assessing the potential impacts of the final rule, including a review of additional sites to which the new rule might be applicable. Depending on the outcome of appeals and the ultimate implementation of the final rule, compliance with these standards could require remedial actions, including removal of coal ash. See Note 8, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” above for a description of the $139 million increase to its ARO that FirstEnergy recorded during 2024 as a result of its analysis.\nFE or its subsidiaries have been named as potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites, which may require cleanup under the CERCLA. Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however, federal law provides that all potentially responsible parties for a particular site may be liable on a joint and several basis. Environmental liabilities that are considered probable have been recognized on FirstEnergy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 based on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, FirstEnergy’s proportionate responsibility for such costs and the financial ability of other unaffiliated entities to pay. Total liabilities of approximately $98 million have been accrued through December 31, 2024, of which approximately $69 million are for environmental remediation of former MGP and gas holder facilities in New Jersey, which are being recovered by JCP&L through a non-bypassable societal benefits charge. FE or its subsidiaries could be found potentially responsible for additional amounts or additional sites, but the loss or range of losses cannot be determined or reasonably estimated at this time.\nOTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nUnited States v. Larry Householder, et al.\nOn July 21, 2020, a complaint and supporting affidavit containing federal criminal allegations were unsealed against the now former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and other individuals and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Householder. In March 2023, a jury found Mr. Householder and his co-defendant, Matthew Borges, guilty and in June 2023, the two were sentenced to prison for 20 and five years, respectively. Messrs. Householder and Borges have appealed their sentences. Also, on July 21, 2020, and in connection with the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s investigation, FirstEnergy received subpoenas for records from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio. FirstEnergy was not aware of the criminal allegations, affidavit or subpoenas before July 21, 2020. On January 17, 2025, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced that a federal grand jury charged two former FirstEnergy senior officers with one count of participating in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act conspiracy. The allegations in the indictment are largely based on the conduct described in the DPA.\nOn July 21, 2021, FE entered into a three-year DPA with the U.S. Attorney’s Office that, subject to court proceedings, resolves this matter as to FE. Under the DPA, FE agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging FE with one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. The DPA required that FirstEnergy, among other obligations: (i) continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in all matters relating to the conduct described in the DPA and other conduct under investigation by the U.S. government; (ii) pay a criminal monetary penalty totaling $230 million within sixty days, consisting of (x) $115 million paid by FE to the United States Treasury and (y) $115 million paid by FE to the ODSA to fund certain assistance programs, as determined by the ODSA, for the benefit of low-income Ohio electric utility customers; (iii) publish a list of all payments made in 2021 to either 501(c)(4) entities or to entities known by FirstEnergy to be operating for the benefit of a public official, either directly or indirectly, and update the same on a quarterly basis during the term of the DPA; (iv) issue a public statement, as dictated in the DPA, regarding FE’s use of 501(c)(4) entities; and (v) continue to implement and review its compliance and ethics program, internal controls, policies and procedures designed, implemented and enforced to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. laws throughout its operations, and to take certain related remedial measures. The $230 million payment will neither be recovered in rates or charged to FirstEnergy customers, nor will FirstEnergy seek any tax deduction related to such payment. The entire amount of the monetary penalty was recognized as expense in the second quarter of 2021 and paid in the third quarter of 2021. As of July 22, 2024, FirstEnergy had successfully completed the obligations required within the three-year term of the DPA. Under the DPA, FirstEnergy has an obligation to continue (i) publishing quarterly a list of all payments to 501(c)(4) entities and all payments to entities known by FirstEnergy operating for the benefit of a public official, either directly or indirectly; (ii) not making any statements that contradict the DPA; (iii) notifying the U.S. Attorney’s Office of any changes in FirstEnergy’s corporate form; and (iv) cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s Office until the conclusion of any related investigation, criminal prosecution, and civil proceeding brought by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, including the aforementioned January 17, 2025, indictment. Within 30 days of those matters concluding, and FirstEnergy’s successful completion of its remaining obligations, the U.S. Attorney’s Office will dismiss the criminal information.\n82\nLegal Proceedings Relating to United States v. Larry Householder, et al.\nOn August 10, 2020, the SEC, through its Division of Enforcement, issued an order directing an investigation of possible securities laws violations by FE, and on September 1, 2020, issued subpoenas to FE and certain FE officers relating to the conduct described in the DPA. On April 28, 2021, July 11, 2022, and May 25, 2023, the SEC issued additional subpoenas to FE, with which FE has complied. FirstEnergy cooperated fully with the SEC investigation, and on September 12, 2024, the SEC issued a settlement order that concluded and resolved the investigation in its entirety. Under the terms of the settlement, FE agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100 million and to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of specified provisions of the federal securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder, which was recognized as a loss contingency of $100 million in the second quarter of 2024 at Corporate/Other for segment reporting and paid on September 25, 2024.\nOn June 29, 2023, the OOCIC served FE a subpoena, seeking information relating to the conduct described in the DPA. FirstEnergy was not aware of the OOCIC’s investigation prior to receiving the subpoena and understood that the OOCIC’s investigation was also focused on the conduct described in the DPA, other than with respect to the March 25, 2024, felony indictment of Mr. Householder brought in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. FirstEnergy is cooperating with the OOCIC in its investigation. On February 12, 2024, and in connection with the OOCIC’s ongoing investigation, an indictment by a grand jury of Summit County, Ohio was unsealed against the now-deceased, former chairman of the PUCO, and two former FirstEnergy senior officers, charging each of them with several felony counts, including bribery, telecommunications fraud, money laundering and aggravated theft, related to payments described in the DPA. On August 12, 2024, FirstEnergy entered into a settlement with the OAG's Office and the Summit County Prosecutor’s Office to resolve both the OOCIC investigation and State of Ohio ex rel. Dave Yost, Ohio Attorney General v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al. and City of Cincinnati and City of Columbus v. FirstEnergy Corp., noted below. The settlement includes, among other things, a non-prosecution agreement and a payment of $19.5 million, which was recorded as a loss contingency in the second quarter of 2024 in FirstEnergy’s Consolidated Statements of Income at Corporate/Other for segment reporting and was paid on August 16, 2024.\nIn addition to the subpoenas referenced above under “\nUnited States v. Larry Householder, et. al.\n” and the SEC investigation, certain FE stockholders and FirstEnergy customers filed several lawsuits against FirstEnergy and certain current and former directors, officers and other employees, and the complaints in each of these suits is related to allegations in the complaint and supporting affidavit relating to HB 6 and the now former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and other individuals and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Householder. The plaintiffs in each of the below cases seek, among other things, to recover an unspecified amount of damages (unless otherwise noted). Unless otherwise indicated, no contingency has been reflected in FirstEnergy’s consolidated financial statements with respect to these lawsuits as a loss is neither probable, nor is a loss or range of a loss reasonably estimable.\n•\nIn re FirstEnergy Corp. Securities Litigation \n(S.D. Ohio); on July 28, 2020 and August 21, 2020, purported stockholders of FE filed putative class action lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws. Those actions have been consolidated and a lead plaintiff, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, has been appointed by the court. A consolidated complaint was filed on February 26, 2021. The consolidated complaint alleges, on behalf of a proposed class of persons who purchased FE securities between February 21, 2017 and July 21, 2020, that FE and certain current or former FE officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by issuing alleged misrepresentations or omissions concerning FE’s business and results of operations. The consolidated complaint also alleges that FE, certain current or former FE officers and directors, and a group of underwriters violated Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 as a result of alleged misrepresentations or omissions in connection with offerings of senior notes by FE in February and June 2020. On March 30, 2023, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On April 14, 2023, FE filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit seeking to appeal that order; the Sixth Circuit granted FE’s petition on November 16, 2023, and heard oral argument on July 17, 2024. On November 30, 2023, FE filed a motion with the S.D. Ohio to stay all proceedings pending that circuit court appeal. Discovery was stayed during the pendency of that motion to stay all proceedings and on August 20, 2024, the S.D. Ohio denied FE’s motion and lifted the stay as to fact discovery. On July 29, 2024, FE filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit a Petition for Writ of Mandamus asking the Sixth Circuit to direct the district court to deny plaintiffs’ motion to compel disclosure of FE’s privileged internal investigation materials. On September 11, 2024, FE filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit a motion to stay discovery of the privileged internal investigation materials pending resolution of the Petition for Writ of Mandamus. FE believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss in connection with the resolution of this lawsuit. Given the ongoing nature and complexity of such litigation, FE cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss.\n•\nMFS Series Trust I, et al. v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al. and Brighthouse Funds II – MFS Value Portfolio, et al. v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al. \n(S.D. Ohio); on December 17, 2021 and February 21, 2022, purported stockholders of FE filed complaints against FE, certain current and former officers, and certain current and former officers of EH. The complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by issuing alleged misrepresentations or omissions regarding FE’s business and its results of operations, and seek the same relief as the \nIn re FirstEnergy Corp. Securities Litigation \ndescribed above. FE believes that it is probable that it will incur losses in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits. Given the ongoing nature and complexity of such litigation, FE cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss.\n \n83\n•\nState of Ohio ex rel. Dave Yost, Ohio Attorney General v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al. and City of Cincinnati and City of Columbus v. FirstEnergy Corp. \n(Common Pleas Court, Franklin County, OH, all actions have been consolidated); on September 23, 2020 and October 27, 2020, the OAG and the cities of Cincinnati and Columbus, respectively, filed complaints against several parties including FE, each alleging civil violations of the Ohio Corrupt Activity Act and related claims in connection with the passage of HB 6. On January 13, 2021, the OAG filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against FirstEnergy seeking to enjoin FirstEnergy from collecting the Ohio Companies' decoupling rider. On January 31, 2021, FE reached a partial settlement with the OAG and the cities of Cincinnati and Columbus with respect to the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction request and related issues. In connection with the partial settlement, the Ohio Companies filed an application on February 1, 2021, with the PUCO to set their respective decoupling riders (Conservation Support Rider) to zero. On February 2, 2021, the PUCO approved the application of the Ohio Companies setting the rider to zero, and no additional customer bills included new decoupling rider charges after February 8, 2021. On August 13, 2021, new defendants were added to the complaint, including two former officers of FirstEnergy. On December 2, 2021, the cities and FE entered a stipulated dismissal with prejudice of the cities’ suit. This matter was stayed through a criminal trial in \nUnited States v. Larry Householder, et al\n. described above, but resumed pursuant to an order, dated March 15, 2023. On July 31, 2023, FE and other defendants filed motions to dismiss in part the OAG’s amended complaint, which the OAG opposed. On February 16, 2024, the OAG moved to stay discovery in the case in light of the February 9, 2024, indictments against defendants in this action, which the court granted on March 14, 2024. As described above, FE reached a settlement with the OAG of this civil action and the OOCIC investigation, which resolves this civil action. FE recognized a loss contingency of $19.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, which was paid on August 16, 2024.\nOn February 9, 2022, FE, acting through the SLC, agreed to a settlement term sheet to resolve the following shareholder derivative lawsuits relating to HB 6 and the now former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and other individuals and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Householder that were filed in the S.D. Ohio, the N.D. Ohio, and the Ohio Court of Common Pleas, Summit County:\n•\nGendrich v. Anderson, et al. and Sloan v. Anderson, et al.\n (Common Pleas Court, Summit County, Ohio, all actions have been consolidated); on July 26, 2020 and July 31, 2020, respectively, purported stockholders of FE filed shareholder derivative action lawsuits against certain current and former FE directors and officers, alleging, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duty. On August 30, 2022, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the state court action, which the court granted on September 2, 2022.\n•\nMiller v. Anderson, et al. \n(N.D. Ohio); on August 7, 2020, purported stockholders of FE filed shareholder derivative actions alleging the then FE Board and officers breached their fiduciary duties and committed violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. On August 24, 2022, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the action pending in the N.D. Ohio based upon the approval of the settlement by the S.D. Ohio, which was granted on May 17, 2024.\n \n•\nBloom, et al. v. Anderson, et al.; Employees Retirement System of the City of St. Louis v. Jones, et al.; Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. Anderson et al.; Massachusetts Laborers Pension Fund v. Anderson et al.; The City of Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement v. Anderson et al.; Atherton v. Dowling et al.; Behar v. Anderson, et al.\n (S.D. Ohio, all actions have been consolidated); on September 1, 2020, purported stockholders of FE filed shareholder derivative actions alleging the then FE Board and officers breached their fiduciary duties and committed violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. On March 11, 2022, the parties executed a stipulation and agreement of settlement, and filed a motion the same day requesting preliminary settlement approval in the S.D. Ohio, which the S.D. Ohio granted on May 9, 2022. Subsequently, following a hearing on August 4, 2022, the S.D. Ohio granted final approval of the settlement on August 23, 2022, which was appealed by a purported FE stockholder on June 15, 2023. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s final settlement approval. All appeal options were exhausted on May 16, 2024.\nThe above settlement included a series of corporate governance enhancements and a payment to FE of $180 million, less approximately $36 million in court-ordered attorney’s fees awarded to plaintiffs, and a $7 million net return on deposited funds, which was received in the second quarter of 2024. The judgment and settlement are final and, therefore, the derivative lawsuits are now fully resolved. \nThe outcome of any of these lawsuits, governmental investigations and audit is uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on FE’s or its subsidiaries’ reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nOther Legal Matters \nThere are various lawsuits, claims (including claims for asbestos exposure) and proceedings related to FirstEnergy’s normal business operations pending against FE or its subsidiaries. The loss or range of loss in these matters is not expected to be material to FE or its subsidiaries. The other potentially material items not otherwise discussed above are described under Note 13, “Regulatory Matters.” \nFirstEnergy accrues legal liabilities only when it concludes that it is probable that it has an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount of such costs. In cases where FirstEnergy determines that it is not probable, but reasonably possible that it has a material obligation, it discloses such obligations and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can \n84\nbe made. If it were ultimately determined that FE or its subsidiaries have legal liability or are otherwise made subject to liability based on any of the matters referenced above, it could have a material adverse effect on FE’s or its subsidiaries’ financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nFirstEnergy prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Application of these principles often requires a high degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions that affect financial results. FirstEnergy's accounting policies require significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions underlying the amounts included in the financial statements. Additional information regarding the application of accounting policies is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoss Contingencies \nFirstEnergy is involved in a number of investigations, litigation, regulatory audits, arbitration, mediation, and similar proceedings, including those surrounding HB 6. FirstEnergy regularly assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establishes reserves when appropriate. In the preparation of the financial statements, FirstEnergy makes judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events based on currently available information and accrues liabilities when it concludes that it is probable that it has an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount of such costs. In cases where FirstEnergy determines that it is not probable, but reasonably possible that it has a material obligation, it discloses such obligations and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be made. Circumstances change over time and actual results may vary significantly from estimates. See Note 14, “Regulatory Matters” and Note 15, “Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable authoritative guidance. FirstEnergy accounts for revenues from contracts with customers under ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” Revenue from financial instruments, derivatives, late payment charges and other contractual rights or obligations and other revenues that are not from contracts with customers are outside the scope of the standard and accounted for under other existing GAAP.\nContracts with Customers\nFirstEnergy follows the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing revenue for electricity that has been delivered to customers but not yet billed through the end of the accounting period. The determination of electricity sales to individual customers for the Electric Companies is based on meter readings, which occur on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, electricity delivered to customers since the last meter reading is estimated and a corresponding accrual for unbilled sales is recognized. The determination of unbilled sales and revenues requires management to make estimates regarding electricity available for retail load, transmission and distribution line losses, demand by customer class, applicable billing demands, weather-related impacts, number of days unbilled and tariff rates in effect within each customer class. \nTransmission revenues are primarily derived from forward-looking formula rates. Forward-looking formula rates recover costs that the regulatory agencies determine are permitted to be recovered and provide a return on transmission capital investment. Under forward-looking formula rates, the revenue requirement is updated annually based on a projected rate base and projected costs, which is subject to an annual true-up based on actual rate base and costs. Revenues and cash receipts for the stand-ready obligation of providing transmission service are recognized ratably over time.\nFirstEnergy has elected the optional invoice practical expedient for most of its revenues and utilizes the optional short-term contract exemption for transmission revenues due to the annual establishment of revenue requirements, which eliminates the need to provide certain revenue disclosures regarding unsatisfied performance obligations. See Note 2, \"Revenue,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRegulatory Accounting\nFE's subsidiaries are subject to regulation that sets the prices (rates) the Electric Companies and the Transmission Companies are permitted to charge customers based on costs that the regulatory agencies determine are permitted to be recovered. At times, regulatory agencies permit the future recovery of costs that would be currently charged to expense by an unregulated company. The ratemaking process results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on anticipated future cash inflows and outflows. \nFirstEnergy reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets, and settlement of regulatory liabilities, at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur. Factors that may affect probability include changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of a regulatory commission order, or passage of new legislation. Upon material changes to these factors, where applicable, FirstEnergy will record new regulatory assets or liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that currently \n85\nrecorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered or settled in future rates. If recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, FirstEnergy will write off that regulatory asset as a charge against earnings. FirstEnergy considers the entire regulatory asset balance as the unit of account for the purposes of balance sheet classification rather than the next year's recovery and as such net regulatory assets and liabilities are presented in the non-current section on the FirstEnergy Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 14, \"Regulatory Matters,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPension and OPEB Accounting\nFirstEnergy provides noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of its employees and non-qualified pension plans that cover certain employees. FirstEnergy provides a modest amount of noncontributory life insurance to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance to a closed group of retired employees. Health care benefits, which include certain employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments, are also available upon retirement to certain employees, their dependents and, under certain circumstances, their survivors. FirstEnergy also has obligations to former or inactive employees after employment, but before retirement, for disability-related benefits.\nFirstEnergy pension and OPEB obligations are based on various assumptions in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality rates, among others. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions are recognized as a pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for remeasurement and affect obligations. \nDiscount Rate\n -\n \nIn selecting an assumed discount rate, FirstEnergy considers currently available rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and OPEB obligations. FirstEnergy utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and other postretirement benefits by applying specific spot rates along the full yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. \nExpected Return on Plan Assets - \nThe expected return on pension and OPEB assets is based on input from investment consultants, including the trusts’ asset allocation targets, the historical performance of risk-based and fixed income securities and other factors. The gains or losses generated as a result of the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets is recognized as a pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for remeasurement. The expected return on pension and OPEB assets for 2025 is 8.5% and 7.0%, respectively.\nMortality Rates - \nThe mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. The Pri-2012 mortality table with projection scale MP-2021, actuarially adjusted to reflect increased mortality due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 was utilized to determine the 2025 benefit cost and obligation as of December 31, 2024, for FirstEnergy's pension and OPEB plans. The MP-2021 scale was published in 2021 by the Society of Actuaries. \nHealth Care Trend Rates\n - Included in determining trend rate assumptions are the specific provisions of FirstEnergy’s health care plans, the demographics and utilization rates of plan participants, actual cost increases experienced in FirstEnergy’s health care plans, and projections of future medical trend rates. \nNet Periodic Benefit Costs (Credits)\n - In addition to service costs, interest on obligations, expected return on plan assets, and prior service costs, FirstEnergy recognizes in net periodic benefit costs a pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment for the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement.\nThe following table reflects the pre-tax portion of pension and OPEB costs that were charged (credited) to expense, including pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustments and special termination benefits, in the three years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\nNet Periodic Benefit Costs (Credits)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nPension\n$\n5 \n$\n57 \n$\n(389)\nOPEB\n(59)\n(40)\n(12)\nTotal\n$\n(54)\n$\n17 \n$\n(401)\nThe annual pre-tax pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, (gains) or losses, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $22 million, $78 million and $(72) million, respectively.\n86\nFirstEnergy expects its 2025 pre-tax net periodic expense, including amounts capitalized and the impact of the 2025 lift-out transaction described below (excluding any potential mark-to-market adjustments) to be approximately $29 million based upon the following assumptions: \nAssumption \nPension\nOPEB\nEffective rate for interest on benefit obligations\n5.41 \n%\n5.28 \n%\nEffective rate for service costs\n5.89 \n%\n5.98 \n%\nEffective rate for interest on service costs\n5.66 \n%\n5.88 \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n8.50 \n%\n7.00 \n%\nRate of compensation increase\n4.30 \n%\nN/A\nThe approximate effects on 2025 pension and OPEB net periodic benefit costs and the 2024 benefit obligation from changes in key assumptions are as follows:\nApproximate Effect on 2025\n \nNet Periodic Benefit Costs from Changes in Key Assumptions\nAssumption\n Change\nPension\nOPEB\nTotal\n \n \n(In millions)\nDiscount rate\nChange by 0.25%\n(1)\n$\n188 \n$\n7 \n$\n195 \nExpected return on plan assets\nChange by 0.25%\n$\n14 \n$\n1 \n$\n15 \nHealth care trend rate\nChange by 1.0%\nN/A\n$\n9 \n$\n9 \n \n (1)\nAssumes a parallel shift in yield curve.\nApproximate Effect on December 31, 2024 Benefit Obligation from Changes in Key Assumptions\nAssumption\nChange\nPension\nOPEB\nTotal\n \n \n(In millions)\nDiscount rate\nChange by 0.25%\n(1)\n$\n203 \n$\n8 \n$\n211 \nHealth care trend rate\nChange by 1.0%\nN/A\n$\n9 \n$\n9 \n \n(1)\nAssumes a parallel shift in yield curve.\nSee Note 5, \"Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n87\nIncome Taxes \nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes, reserve amounts for uncertain tax positions, and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities such as the interpretation of tax laws and associated regulations. FirstEnergy is required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations in order to estimate its obligations to taxing authorities. \nAccounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. FirstEnergy records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for tax purposes. Investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being amortized over the recovery period of the related property. Deferred income tax liabilities related to temporary tax and accounting basis differences and tax credit carryforward items are recognized at the statutory income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. Deferred tax assets are recognized based on income tax rates expected to be in effect when they are settled.\nFirstEnergy accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in its financial statements using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement. If it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. FirstEnergy recognizes interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions by applying the applicable statutory interest rate to the difference between the tax position recognized and the amount previously taken, or expected to be taken, on the tax return. \nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including future changes in income tax laws, or new regulations or guidance, forecasted results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities.\nSee Note 7, \"Taxes,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 1, \"Organization and Basis of Presentation,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.",
