Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeneral\nMarsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries (Marsh McLennan or the \"Company\") is a global professional services firm in the areas of risk, strategy and people. The Company helps clients build the confidence to thrive through the power of its four market-leading businesses. With annual revenue of over $24 billion, the Company has more than 90,000 colleagues advising clients in 130 countries.    \nMarsh provides data-driven risk advisory services and insurance solutions to commercial and consumer clients. Guy Carpenter develops advanced risk, reinsurance and capital strategies that help clients grow profitably and pursue emerging opportunities. Mercer delivers advice and technology-driven solutions that help organizations redefine the world of work, reshape retirement and investment outcomes, and unlock health and well-being for a changing workforce. Oliver Wyman Group serves as a critical strategic, economic and brand advisor to private sector and governmental clients. The four businesses also collaborate together to deliver new solutions to help clients manage complex and interconnected risks.\nThe Company conducts business through two segments:\n•\nRisk and Insurance Services (RIS)\n includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter.\n•\nConsulting\n includes health, wealth and career advice, solutions and products, and specialized management, strategic, economic and brand consulting services. The Company conducts business in this segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group.\nThe results of operations in the Management Discussion & Analysis (\"MD&A\") include an overview of the Company's consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the corresponding periods in 2024, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes. This section also includes a discussion of the key drivers impacting the Company's financial results of operations both on a consolidated basis and by reportable segments.  \nWe describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each reportable segment in the discussion of segment financial results. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 18, Segment Information, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this report. \nFor information and comparability of the Company's results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, refer to \"Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to \"Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" at the outset of this report. \nNon-GAAP measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), referred to as in accordance with \"GAAP\" or \"reported\" results. The Company also refers to and presents a non-GAAP financial measure in non-GAAP revenue, within the meaning of Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company has included a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP as part of the consolidated revenue and expense discussion. Percentage changes, referred to as non-GAAP underlying revenue, are calculated by dividing the period over period change in non-GAAP revenue by the prior period non-GAAP revenue. \nThe Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods. Management also uses this measure internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider this non-GAAP measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measure \n40\nincludes adjustments that reflect how management views its businesses and may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nFinancial Highlights\n•\nConsolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $6.4 billion, an increase of 11%, or 4% on an underlying basis.

As a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period over period comparisons of revenue. Similarly, certain other items such as acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, may impact period over period comparisons of revenue. Non-GAAP revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to the next by isolating these impacts on an underlying revenue basis. Percentage changes, referred to as non-GAAP underlying revenue, are calculated by dividing the period over period change in non-GAAP revenue by the prior period non-GAAP revenue. \nThe non-GAAP revenue measure is presented on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company isolates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements period over period, by translating the current period foreign currency GAAP revenue into U.S. Dollars based on the difference in the current and corresponding prior period exchange rates. \nThe percentage change for acquisitions, dispositions, and other includes the impact of current and prior year items excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP underlying revenue for comparability purposes. Details on these items are provided in the reconciliation of non-GAAP revenue to GAAP revenue tables.\nThe following tables present the Company's non-GAAP revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related non-GAAP underlying revenue change:\nThree Months Ended September 30,   \n(In millions, except percentages)\nGAAP Revenue\n% Change \nGAAP

Expenses also reflect an 8% increase from acquisitions.\nConsolidated operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased due to acquisitions, primarily in Risk and Insurance Services, resulting in higher compensation and benefits and amortization of identified intangibles.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the Company launched a three-year program, Thrive, which focuses on our brand strategy, delivering greater value to clients, accelerating growth and improving efficiency. The Company also announced the formation of Business Client Services (\"BCS\"), to accelerate innovation and centralize investments in operational excellence, data, AI and other analytics. BCS brings together operations and technology teams across the Company to improve client service through enhancing our technology and effective deployment of resources. \nThe Program will generate savings from process and automation efficiencies and optimization of our global operating model. \nBased on current Program estimates, the Company expects to incur approximately $500 million of cost over the three years. Costs will primarily relate to severance, technology and outside services. Annualized savings are expected to be approximately $400 million. The Company expects savings realized and charges incurred to be evenly distributed over the Program period. \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 costs incurred in connection with the Program were $38 million, related to severance and outside services. \nThe Company continues to refine its detailed plans for the Program which may change the timing, expected costs, and related savings. \n47\nRisk and Insurance Services\nIn the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, in\nsurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking, insurance program management, risk consulting, analytical modeling and alternative risk financing services, primarily under the brand of Marsh, and engage in specialized reinsurance broking expertise, strategic advisory services and analytics solutions, primarily under the brand of Guy Carpenter.\nThe results of operations for the Risk and Insurance Services segment are as follows:\nThree Months Ended\n September 30,\nNine Months Ended \n September 30,\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRevenue\n$\n3,907\n$\n3,453\n$\n13,294\n$\n11,748\nCompensation and benefits\n2,424\n2,095\n7,337\n6,321\nOther operating expenses\n \n733\n625\n2,151\n1,832\nOperating expenses\n3,157\n2,720\n9,488\n8,153\nOperating income\n$\n750\n$\n733\n$\n3,806\n$\n3,595\nOperating income margin\n19.2\n%\n21.2\n%\n28.6\n%\n30.6\n%\nRevenue\nRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased $454 million, or 13%, to $3.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $3.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue increased 3% on an underlying basis, 9% from acquisitions, and 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. Interest earned on fiduciary funds decreased $29 million to $109 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $138 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to lower average interest rates compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year.  \nRevenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment increased $1.5 billion, or 13%, to $13.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $11.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Interest earned on fiduciary funds decreased $74 million to $311 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $385 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to lower average interest rates compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.  \nIn Risk and Insurance Services, underlying revenue growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was driven by growth in new business and renewal revenue at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, partially offset by declining insurance and reinsurance rates.\nMarsh's revenue increased $466 million, or 16%, to $3.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $2.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This reflects an increase of 4% on an underlying basis, 11% from acquisitions, and 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. U.S./Canada rose 3% on an underlying basis.

This reflects an increase of 5% on an underlying basis and 1%\n \nfrom acquisitions.\n48\nGuy Carpenter’s underlying revenue growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was driven by growth across most regions\n.\nThe Risk and Insurance Services segment completed 8 acquisitions for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Information regarding these acquisitions is included in Note 8, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \nOperating Expenses\nExpenses in the Risk and Insurances Services segment increased $437 million, or 16%, to $3.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $2.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

This reflects an increase of 4% on an underlying basis and 3% from acquisitions.\nIn Consulting, underlying revenue growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was driven by growth in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group.\nMercer's revenue increased $127 million, or 9%, to $1.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This reflects an increase of 3% on an underlying basis, 4% from acquisitions, and 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. \n49\nOn an underlying basis, revenue for Health and Wealth increased 6% and 3%, respectively, and remained flat in Career, as compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year.\nMercer's revenue increased $317 million, or 7%, to $4.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $4.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This reflects an increase of 3% on an underlying basis and 4% from acquisitions. On an underlying basis, revenue for Health and Wealth increased 6% and 3%, respectively, and decreased 2% in Career, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.\nUnderlying revenue growth at Mercer was driven by continued solid growth in Health and stable growth at Wealth. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was offset by a contraction in Career. Health reflected strong growth across all regions. Wealth growth was driven by investment management, primarily reflecting positive net flows and the impact of capital markets. Career reflected continued softness in project-related work in the U.S. and Canada, offset by growth in workforce products. \nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a net gain of $21 million from the sale of the Mercer U.K. pension administration and U.S. health and benefits administration businesses.\nOliver Wyman Group's revenue increased $76 million, or 9%, to $886 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $810 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

This reflects an increase of 5% on an underlying basis and 1%\n \nfrom the impact of foreign currency translation. \nThe increase in underlying revenue growth at Oliver Wyman Group for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was driven by growth in each of the regions. Underlying revenue growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was driven by growth in the Americas and the Middle East.\nThe Consulting segment completed 4 acquisitions for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Information regarding these acquisitions is included in Note 8, Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Expenses\nExpenses in the Consulting segment increased $164 million, or 9%, to $2.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Expenses reflect a 2% increase from acquisitions and 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation.\nExpenses in the Consulting segment increased $349 million, or 6%, to $5.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $5.4 billion for the nine\n \nmonths ended\n \nSeptember 30, 2024. Expenses reflect a 3% increase from acquisitions.\nExpenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased due to compensation and benefits driven by higher base salaries and incentive compensation. Expenses also increased due to acquisitions.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, expenses also reflected acquisition and disposition costs of $21 million, primarily related to exit costs for the disposition of the Mercer U.K. pension administration and U.S. health benefits administration businesses in 2024.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate expenses decreased $6 million, or 6%, to $81 million\n \nfor the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $87 million\n \nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024. Corporate expenses decreased $9 million, or 4%, to $215 million\n \nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $224 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $10 million, compared to $12 million\n \nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $34 million, compared to $61 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \nInterest income decreased $2 million and\n \n$27 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, due to lower average interest rates compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. \n50\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $237 million, compared to $154 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $725 million, compared to $469 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \nInterest expense increased $83 million\n \nand $256 million\n \nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, due to debt raised to fund the McGriff acquisition.\nInvestment Income\nThe caption \"Investment income\" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on the Company's investments in private equity funds. The Company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds. \nThe Company recorded net investment income of $15 million and $27 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to net investment income of $1 million and $3 million, respectively,\n \nfor the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in 2025 for both periods is primarily driven by higher mark-to-market gains from the Company's investments. \nIncome and Other Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was 25.1%, compared with 27.3% for the corresponding quarter of 2024. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were 24.2% and 25.8%, respectively.\nThe tax rate in each period reflects the impact of discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, enacted tax legislation, changes in uncertain tax positions, deferred tax adjustments, non-taxable adjustments related to contingent consideration for acquisitions, and valuation allowances for certain tax credits and attributes. \nThe excess tax benefit related to share-based payments is the most significant discrete item in both periods, reducing the effective tax rate by 0.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and by 1.0% and 1.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the Company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates. Therefore, a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions, or changes in the Company's repatriation strategy to access offshore cash, can affect the effective tax rate. \nIn addition, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate in a particular period, depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized. A valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized. The effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitations.\nThe Company has established liabilities for uncertain tax positions in relation to potential assessments in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In 2024, the Company received closure notices and assessments from the U.K. tax authority in relation to its 2016-2020 examinations which disallowed certain interest expense deductions. The Company has appealed the assessments and resolving this matter through litigation or alternative dispute resolution may take several years. The Company believes the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company. However, an adverse resolution of tax matters could have a material impact on the Company's net income or cash flows and on its effective tax rate in a particular future period. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to approximately $69 million within the next twelve months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations.\nChanges in tax laws, rulings, policies, or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate.\n51\nOn July 4, 2025, U.S tax legislation was signed into law (known as the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" or \"OBBBA\") which makes permanent many of the tax provisions enacted in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that were set to expire at the end of 2025. In addition, the OBBBA makes changes to certain U.S. corporate tax provisions, but many are generally not effective until 2026. The enactment of the OBBBA does not have a material impact on the results from operations for the current year or future years.\nIn 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") released model rules for a 15% global minimum tax, known as Pillar Two. Pillar Two has now been enacted by most key non-U.S. jurisdictions where the Company operates, including the U.K. and Ireland. Parts of the minimum tax rules were applicable in 2024, with the remaining provisions becoming fully effective for 2025. This minimum tax is treated as a period cost and does not have a material impact on the Company's financial results from operations for the current period. The Company continues to monitor legislative developments, as well as additional guidance from countries that have enacted Pillar Two legislation, and will ensure it complies with any changes.\nAs a U.S. domiciled parent holding company, the Company is the issuer of essentially all the Company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the U.S. The Company’s interest expense deductions are not currently limited. However, the Company may not be able to fully deduct intercompany interest on loans used to finance the Company's foreign operations. \nFurther, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the U.S. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the U.S. Some of these expenses may not be deductible in the U.S., which may impact the effective tax rate. Changes to the U.S. tax law in recent years have allowed the Company to repatriate foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal income tax costs as foreign income is generally already taxed in the U.S. However, permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the Company's global capital strategy. The Company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements and potential costs of repatriation, which are generally limited to local country withholding taxes. \n52\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. As the Company does not have significant operations of its own, the Company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. The Company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of Guy Carpenter. Other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed in the Financing Cash Flows section.\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the U.S. Funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the U.S. out of annual earnings. At September 30, 2025, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $516 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. The Company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. Where appropriate, a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested. \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which increased net eq\nuity\n by $770 million. \nContinu\ned weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would further increase the translated U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the translated U.S. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries. \nCash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Fiduciary assets are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, with a corresponding amount in current liabilities. Fiduciary assets cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the Company. \nOperating Cash Flows\nThe Company provided $3.1 billion of cash from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $2.3 billion for the first nine months of 2024. These amounts reflect the net income of the Company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities, including incentive compensation, or receipts of receivables and pension plan contributions. The Company used cash of $138 million and $195 million related to its restructuring activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nPension Related Items\nContributions\nThe Company's policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in accordance with applicable law. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company contributed $9 million and $29 million, respectively, to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $12 million and $27 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company contributed $8 million and $25 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans, respectively, and $8 million and $42 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, respectively. \nIn the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") guidelines and the Company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined in accordance with the ERISA guidelines. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company made contributions of $9 million and $27 million, respectively, to its non-qualified plans. The Company also made $2 million of required contributions to its U.S. qualified plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The Company expects to make approximately $8 million of additional contributions to it's U.S. non-qualified plans over the remainder of 2025. \nOutside the U.S., the Company has a large number of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the U.K., which comprise approximately 78% of non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2024. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n53\nIn the U.K., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occur every 3 years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. Currently, this results in a lower funded status compared to U.S. GAAP and may result in contributions irrespective of the U.S. GAAP funded status.\nIn 2021, the JLT Pension Scheme was merged into the MMC U.K. Pension Fund with a new segregated JLT section created (referred to as the \"JLT section\"). The Company is not required to make any deficit contributions to the JLT section in 2025. The funding level will be re-assessed during the fourth quarter of 2025 as part of the December 31, 2024 actuarial valuation to determine if contributions are required in 2026.\nFor the MMC U.K. Pension Fund, excluding the JLT section, an agreement was reached with the trustee in the fourth quarter of 2022, based on the surplus funding position at December 31, 2021. In accordance with the agreement, no deficit funding is required at the earliest until 2026. The funding level will be re-assessed during the fourth quarter of 2025 as part of the December 31, 2024 actuarial valuation to determine if contributions are required in 2026. In December 2022, the Company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions that may be required by the U.K. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to £450 million (or $603 million) over a seven year period. This is part of an agreement which gives the Company greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions.\nThe Company expects to fund an additional $16 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans over the remainder of 2025, mainly to plans outside of the U.K. \nFinancing Cash Flows\nNet cash used for financing activities was $2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with $1.8 billion used for financing activities for the corresponding period in 2024. \nCredit Facilities\nThe Company has a $3.5 billion multi-currency unsecured five-year credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") expiring October 2028.

The Company is required to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios for the Credit Facility, which are evaluated quarterly.\nThe Credit Facility includes provisions for determining a benchmark replacement rate in the event existing benchmark rates are no longer available, or in certain other circumstances, in which an alternative rate may be required.

As a result, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations between the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rates. As part of its risk management program, the Company designated its €1.1 billion senior note debt instruments (\"Euro notes\") as a net investment hedge (the \"hedge\") of its Euro denominated subsidiaries. The hedge is re-assessed each quarter to confirm that the designated equity balance at the beginning of each period continues to equal or exceed 80% of the outstanding balance of the Euro debt instrument and that all the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged net investment continue to match. If the hedge is highly effective, the change in the debt balance related to foreign exchange fluctuations is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. \nThe U.S. dollar value of the Euro notes increased by $141 million through September 30, 2025, due to the change in foreign exchange rates. The Company concluded that the hedge was highly effective and recorded an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. \nFiduciary Liabilities\nSince fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, with a corresponding amount in current liabilities.
