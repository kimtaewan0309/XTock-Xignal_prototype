Through breakthrough technologies, world-class evidence and partnerships with clinicians and healthcare stakeholders, our employees are inspired by our patient-focused culture to deliver life-changing innovations to structural heart patients who need them most.\n \nEdwards Lifesciences has been a leader in our field for over six decades.\n \nSince our founder, Miles Lowell Edwards, first dreamed of using engineering to address diseases of the human heart, we have steadily built a company on the premise of imagining, building, and realizing a better future for patients.\nOur innovative work encompasses both surgical and transcatheter therapies. In addition, our unique portfolio of repair and replacement technologies for both mitral and tricuspid heart valves provides a broad set of treatment options to serve the many diverse and complex patients in need. Edwards remains committed to its strategy of transformative product innovation, robust and expanding clinical evidence to support approvals and adoption, as well as comprehensive support to ensure excellent real-world patient outcomes.    \nCardiovascular disease is the number-one cause of death in the world and is the top disease in terms of health care spending in nearly every country. In the U.S. alone, one cardiovascular patient dies every 33 seconds. Cardiovascular disease is progressive in that it tends to worsen over time and often affects the structure of\n \nan individual's heart. Our vision is to transform patient care where patients are diagnosed earlier, treated in a routine fashion, live longer, and enjoy a better quality of life. Our future growth opportunities include offering solutions for treating patients with both valvular and non-valvular structural heart disease, such as heart failure, which is a natural progression of the disease for many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation\nPatients undergoing treatment for cardiovascular disease can be treated with a number of our medical technologies, which are designed to address individual patient needs with respect to disease process, comorbidities, and health status. For example, an individual with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve that is affecting the function of his or her heart or blood flow throughout his or her body. A cardiac surgeon may elect to remove the valve and replace it with one of our bioprosthetic surgical tissue heart valves or surgically re-shape and repair the faulty valve with an Edwards annuloplasty ring. Alternatively, a clinician (typically an interventional cardiologist) may implant an Edwards transcatheter valve or repair system via a catheter-based approach that does not require traditional open-heart surgery and can be done while the heart continues to beat. \nCorporate Background\nOur principal executive offices are located at One Edwards Way, Irvine, California 92614. The telephone number at that address is (949) 250-2500. We make available, free of charge on our website located at www.edwards.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this report.\nEdwards Lifesciences' Product and Technology Offerings\nThe following discussion summarizes the main groups of products and technologies we offer to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Our products are categorized into the following groups: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (\"TAVR\"), Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (\"TMTT\"), and Surgical Structural Heart (\"Surgical\"). For more information on net sales from these three main groups, see \"\nNet Sales by Product Group\n\" in Part II, Item 7 \"\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\" \nTranscatheter Aortic Valve Replacement \nWe are the global leader in transcatheter heart valve replacement technologies designed for the minimally-invasive replacement of aortic heart valves. The \nEdwards SAPIEN\n family of valves, including the \nEdwards SAPIEN 3\n, the \nEdwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra\n, and the\n Edwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA\n systems, are catheter-based approaches for treating patients who have severe aortic stenosis. The \nSAPIEN 3 \nvalves are delivered while the heart is still beating. The majority of these procedures are conducted without the use of general anesthesia and patients are discharged home within one to two days. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the \nSAPIEN 3\n family of valves enables patients to recover more quickly and return to a better quality of life sooner than patients receiving traditional open heart surgical therapies. Edwards' transcatheter aortic heart valves \n2\nTable of Contents\nwere first commercialized in Europe in 2007, in the United States in 2011, and in Japan in 2013.\n \nEdwards has partnered with the physician community to generate optimistic data that has expanded access to patients of all risk profiles. In 2024, \nEARLY TAVR\n trial data were presented, demonstrating the superiority of early TAVR intervention in severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis patients with the \nSAPIEN 3\n platform versus clinical surveillance. The \nSAPIEN 3 \nplatform remains the only transcatheter heart valve with a THV-in-THV indication for patients assessed at high-risk for surgical replacement, offering patients the ability to have a second minimally invasive procedure. The \nSAPIEN\n family of valves are the most widely implanted transcatheter heart valves in the world with over one million patient lives impacted since launch. Additionally, the \nEdwards\n \nSAPIEN 3\n system and \nAlterra\n system offer a minimally invasive option for pulmonary valve replacement for patients with congenital heart disease.\nSales of our TAVR products represented 75%, 77%, and 79% of our net sales in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nTranscatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies\nWe continue to make significant investments in the development of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases. While several technologies are in the development and clinical phases, the \nPASCAL Precision \ntranscatheter repair system (in Europe, the United States, and Japan), \nEVOQUE \ntricuspid valve replacement system (in Europe and the United States), and \nCardioband \ntricuspid valve reconstruction system (in Europe) are commercially available. The \nPASCAL Precision\n system addresses the needs of patients with mitral or tricuspid regurgitation through leaflet approximation, while the \nCardioband\n system enables clinicians to reduce the size of a valve's annulus to lower regurgitation. The \nEVOQUE\n system, the world's first transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement therapy to receive regulatory approval, addresses tricuspid valve regurgitation by replacing the native valve with a bioprosthetic valve. In addition to these therapies, we are pursuing a transcatheter mitral replacement strategy which we believe would position us for leadership in the mid-to-long term. The \nSAPIEN M3\n transcatheter mitral valve replacement system is based on the proven \nSAPIEN\n valve and is designed specifically for mitral patients. We believe both transcatheter repair and replacement are necessary to unlock the full mitral and tricuspid opportunity. \nSurgical Structural Heart\nWe continue to invest in bringing innovations to cardiac surgery patients. Our \nRESILIA\n tissue, with published clinical data showing 99% freedom from structural valve deterioration through seven years\n1\n, has set the new standard for tissue valve durability. Our flagship \nINSPIRIS RESILIA\n aortic valve, offers \nRESILIA\n tissue and \nVFit\n technology. \nINSPIRIS\n is the leading aortic surgical valve in the world. Sales of our surgical therapies in the United States also continue to gain traction with \nKONECT RESILIA\n, the first pre-assembled, ready to implant, tissue valved conduit for complex combined procedures. \nOur latest innovation, the \nMITRIS RESILIA\n valve, is commercially available in the United States, Europe, and Japan, as well as other geographies, where it has been widely adopted by surgeons as the leading product in our mitral valve portfolio. We believe the demand for surgical structural heart therapies is growing worldwide, and that our innovation strategy will continue to strengthen our leadership and positive impact on patients.\nSales of our surgical tissue heart valve products represented 18%, 19%, and 19% of our net sales in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nCompetition\nThe medical technology industry is highly competitive. We compete with divisions of larger companies as well as smaller companies that offer competitive product lines in certain geographies in which we operate. We also compete with both established and newer technologies that target the patients served by our products. New product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including drug therapies. Our strategy is to develop and produce safe and effective therapies supported by rigorous clinical studies with extensive data and with innovative features that can enhance patient benefits and product performance and reliability, as well as benefit healthcare systems. The benefits associated with our products are in part due to the level of customer and clinical support we provide. \n1\n \nBeaver T, Bavaria JE, Griffith B, et al. Seven-year outcomes following aortic valve replacement with a novel tissue bioprosthesis. Presented at the 103rd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, May 2023. \n3\nTable of Contents\nThe cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs. The ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers.\n    \nWe believe that we are a leading global competitor in each of our product lines. In TAVR, our primary competitors include Medtronic plc (\"Medtronic\"), Abbott Laboratories (\"Abbott\"), and Boston Scientific Corporation. In TMTT, our primary competitor is Abbott, and there are a considerable number of large and small companies with development efforts in these fields. In Surgical, our primary competitors include Medtronic, Abbott, and Artivion, Inc (formerly CryoLife). \nSales and Marketing\nOur portfolio includes some of the most recognizable cardiovascular device product brands in treating structural heart disease today. We have a number of product lines that require sales and marketing strategies that are tailored to deliver high-quality, cost-effective products and technologies to customers worldwide. Because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve, our distribution system consists of several direct sales forces as well as independent distributors. We are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in 2024.\nTo achieve optimal outcomes for patients, we conduct educational symposia and best practices training for our physician, hospital executive, service line leadership, nursing, and clinical-based customers. We rely extensively on our sales and field clinical specialist personnel who work closely with our customers in hospitals. Field clinical specialists routinely attend procedures where Edwards' products are being used in order to provide guidance on the use of our devices, thereby enabling physicians and staff to reach expert proficiency and deliver positive patient outcomes. In addition to working closely with physicians, nurses, and other clinical personnel, our customers include decision makers such as service line leaders, material managers, biomedical staff, hospital administrators and executives, purchasing managers, and ministries of health. Also, for certain of our product lines and where appropriate, our corporate sales team actively pursues approval of Edwards Lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations (\"GPOs\") that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products. Additionally, we have contracts with a number of United States and European national and regional buying groups, including healthcare systems and Integrated Delivery Networks. Where we choose to market our products is also influenced by the existence of, or potential for, adequate reimbursement to hospitals and other providers by national healthcare systems. \nUnited States.\n In the United States, we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales forces. In 2024, 59% of our net sales were derived from sales to customers in the United States.\nOutside of the United States.\n In 2024, 41% of our net sales were derived outside of the United States through our direct sales forces and independent distributors. Of the total sales outside of the United States, 59% were in Europe, 15% were in Japan, and 26% were in Rest of World. We sell our products in approximately 100 countries, including Germany, Japan, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, and China. A majority of the sales and marketing approach outside of the United States is direct sales, although it varies depending on each country's size and state of development.\nRaw Materials and Manufacturing\nWe operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world. We manufacture our TAVR, TMTT, and Surgical products primarily in the United States, Singapore, Costa Rica, and Ireland. \nWe use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design, development, and manufacture of our products. We manufacture our non-implantable products from fabricated raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics, and metals. Most of our replacement heart valves are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as fabricated materials. We purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of sole source availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.\nWe work with our suppliers to mitigate risk and seek continuity of supply while maintaining quality and reliability. Alternative supplier options are generally considered, identified, and approved for materials deemed critical to our products, although we do not typically pursue immediate regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.\nWe comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products incorporating animal tissue intended to be implanted in humans. We follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential \n4\nTable of Contents\nrisks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"BSE\"). We obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the United States and Australia, where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist. In addition, bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility. Our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses.\nQuality Assurance\nWe are committed to providing quality products to patients and have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization. The quality system starts with the initial design concept, risk management, and product specification, and continues through the design of the product, packaging and labeling, and the manufacturing, sales, support, and servicing of the product. The quality system is intended to design quality into the products and uses continuous improvement concepts, including Lean/Six Sigma principles, throughout the product lifecycle.\nOur operations are frequently inspected by the many regulators that oversee medical device manufacturing, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), European Notified Bodies, and other regulatory entities. The medical technology industry is highly regulated and our facilities and operations are designed to comply with all applicable quality systems standards, including the International Organization for Standardization (\"ISO\") 13485:2016. These standards require, among other items, quality system controls that are applied to product design, component material, suppliers, and manufacturing operations. These regulatory approvals and ISO certifications can be obtained only after a successful audit of a company's quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditors. Periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications.\nEnvironmental, Health, and Safety\nWe are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace and complying with all relevant regulations and medical technology industry standards. Through our corporate and site level Environmental, Health, and Safety functions, we establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution, prevent injuries, and maintain compliance with applicable regulations. In order to measure performance, we monitor and report on a number of metrics, including regulated and non-regulated waste disposal, energy usage, water consumption, air emissions, and injuries from our production activities. Each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of Environmental, Health, and Safety criteria.\nResearch and Development\nIn 2024, we made significant investments in research and development, both internally and through acquisitions, as we worked to develop therapies that we believe have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Research and development spending increased 9% year over year, representing 19% of 2024 sales. This increase was primarily the result of significant investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs, including an increase in clinical research for our mitral, aortic, and tricuspid therapies. We are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety, and reliability of our current leading products, and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate. We focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease.\nA considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions, and required post-market approval studies involving applications of our products. Our investment in clinical studies also includes outcomes and cost-effectiveness data for payers, clinicians, and healthcare systems.\nIn TAVR, we are developing new products to further improve and streamline transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement procedures. \nIn TMTT, we are making significant investments in innovation and clinical evidence to develop technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases.  \nOur Surgical development programs include innovative platforms for patients who are best treated surgically, specifically active patients and patients with more complex combined procedures. \nOur future growth opportunities include offering solutions for treating patients with both valvular and non-valvular structural heart disease, such as heart failure, which is a natural progression of the disease for many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\n5\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nEdwards Lifesciences Corporation is the leading global structural heart innovation company, driven by a passion to improve patient lives.

Our experienced research and development staff are focused on product design and development, quality, clinical research, and regulatory compliance. To pursue primary research efforts, we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities, and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products.\nProprietary Technology\nPatents, trademarks, and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing innovations, licensing opportunities, and non-disclosure agreements to develop and maintain our competitive position.\nWe own or have rights to a substantial number of patents and have patent applications pending both in the United States and in foreign countries. We continue to innovate and file new patent applications to protect our new products and technologies.\nAdditionally, we are a party to license agreements and other arrangements with various third parties pursuant to which we have obtained, for varying terms, the exclusive or non-exclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for cross-licensing rights and/or royalty payments. We have also licensed certain patent rights to others.\nWe undertake reasonable measures to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us, and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents.\nMoreover, we own certain United States registered trademarks used in our business. Many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.\n6\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulation and Other Matters\nOur products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA, European Union (\"EU\") member states competent authorities, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. These entities confirm our compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products. \nWe are also governed by federal, state, local, and international laws of general applicability, including, but not limited to, those regulating employee health and safety, labor, competition, governance and securities, privacy, anti-corruption, trade secret, commercial, trade, and the protection of the environment. Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date, but new regulations, amendments to existing regulations, or new interpretations of existing regulations could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.\nUnited States Regulation.\n    In the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices. The FDA regulates the design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, and record keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Many of our devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements. The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly. A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales. Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other regulatory standards. Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may impose restrictions or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.\nThe FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear to be violative of its regulations. The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements. The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution. Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review. Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the import of medical devices into the United States, which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.\nWe are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:\n•\nfederal, state, and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments to anyone, including physicians, as an inducement to purchase or recommend a product;\n•\nthe Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider;\n•\nfederal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996;\n•\nthe Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of United States physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers, including medical device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies;\n7\nTable of Contents\n•\nthe False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payor; and\n•\nthe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute United States companies for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties, or for not keeping accurate financial records or maintaining adequate internal controls to prevent and detect arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties. \nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities. To assist in our compliance efforts, we work to adhere to our many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our business activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate. In addition, we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies.\nRegulation Outside of the United States.\n    Outside of the United States, the regulation of medical devices is also complex. In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. The regulatory regime in the EU for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998. It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose. National laws conforming to the EU's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system. Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions. The EU medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark. Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body. In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.\nIn May 2017, the EU implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation (\"MDR\"). The MDR became effective on May 26, 2021, and brought significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain, and additional post-market surveillance and vigilance. Compliance with the MDR requires re-certification of many of our products to the enhanced standards, and has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial additional expense. In addition, in the European Economic Area, we import some of our devices to supply product to Switzerland. Switzerland is not a member state of the EU, but is linked to the EU through bilateral treaties; therefore, the free movement of goods, including medical devices, between the EU and Switzerland after implementation of the MDR required a revised Mutual Recognition Agreement (\"MRA\") that had not been agreed to until recently and which requires additional regulatory steps on registration and labeling.  \nIn Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices. Clinical studies are subject to a stringent Japanese \"Good Clinical Practices\" standard. Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device. In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the \"Good Import Practices\" regulations. As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.\nIn many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:\n•\nproduct standards and specifications;\n•\npackaging requirements;\n•\nlabeling requirements;\n•\nproduct collection and disposal requirements;\n•\nquality system requirements;\n8\nTable of Contents\n•\nimport restrictions;\n•\ntariffs;\n•\nduties; and\n•\ntax requirements.\nMany of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs. In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.\nHealth Care Initiatives.\n    Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, increasing evidentiary demands, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe, and Japan. As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. For example, government programs, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before covering payment of new or innovative devices or therapies that are used by patients. These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.\nThe delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services. Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare. HHS' Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries. Changes in current coverage and reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.  \nHealth care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power. The medical technology industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past. These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may have a material impact on product pricing.\nThese laws or any future legislation, including deficit reduction legislation, could impact medical procedure volumes, reimbursement for our products, and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.\nSeasonality\nOur quarterly sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors. Sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.\nHuman Capital Management Strategy\nHuman Capital Management (\"HCM\") Governance\nThe primary goals of our talent management strategy are to attract, develop and retain a motivated, professional workforce and to strive for alignment on our patient-focused innovation strategy.\nOur Board of Directors routinely engages with leadership to review and discuss our human capital management (\"HCM\"), with time dedicated at each regularly scheduled meeting to discuss talent management, which includes topics such as talent strategy, succession planning, employee development, critical role talent acquisition, employee health, safety, and welfare, results of employee surveys, and compensation. Our Board of Directors also annually approves the strategic talent imperatives \n9\nTable of Contents\nthat are tied to our Key Operating Drivers (\"KODs\"). Our KODs are tracked using a point system across our entire organization that focus the Company and management toward short-, medium-, and long-term goals. The strategic talent imperatives are developed to identify talent related initiatives that support achievement of the KODs.  \nIn addition, the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and his leadership team have talent management related performance goals tied to their compensation; these Performance Management Objectives are reviewed on an annual basis, tracked, and then reported to and evaluated by our Board of Directors.\nAs we scale to reach more patients around the world, we have integrated our Talent & Organization (“T&O”) Strategy with our Edwards Strategic Planning process. The purpose of our T&O Strategy is to anticipate global trends related to our workforce, develop our talent to meet future organizational needs, and enable us to be well-poised to meet these needs. Our T&O Strategy enables us to explore external workforce signals, share insights, and identify and build emerging capabilities across our organization. We have also developed a comprehensive succession planning process that allows us to build strong talent from within while we pursue an aggressive recruiting process to fill any gaps with highly qualified external talent. This consistent and scalable approach looks across all our product groups, regions, and significant functions to align and elevate priorities, critical capabilities, and organizational evolutions in line with our strategic plan. This integrated approach informs our yearly objectives and fuels our talent roadmap across the strategic horizon.\nOur HCM governance includes a global talent development review (\"TDR\") process to align our talent strategies with our business strategy, assess talent against future organizational needs, evaluate critical talent populations, and enhance the strength of our succession planning. We track our performance regularly.\nCulture\nInvesting in our workforce means our employees can stay focused on our patient-focused innovation strategy and the development of life-saving therapies for the patients we serve. We are committed to maintaining an ethical culture where we celebrate diversity, promote good health and safety, empower employees to speak up, and ensure that employees' voices are heard. We strive to offer competitive employee well-being packages and are committed to fair and equitable pay practices. We track compensation patterns in all geographies where we operate, and we regularly look for ways to ensure fair and equitable pay.\nWe are proud of our patient-focused culture, and the way we work together globally to bring life-saving innovations to patients in need. We recognize the need for diverse perspectives and experiences, and we foster inclusion, belonging, and collaboration across Edwards. We are committed to fostering an environment where all employees can grow and thrive, understanding that diverse perspectives enable our commitment to innovation. We believe this commitment can be best achieved by always selecting the best candidate and building a culture that celebrates excellence. We aim to deliver this by centering our decisions on the following focus areas whose overriding priority is \"The Patient\" - Business, People, Communication, and Community. As a practice, all employees receive global business practice standards and unconscious bias training as a foundational aspect of our culture, and we include a non-discrimination clause in our Global Business Practice Standards and Third Party Code of Conduct.\nEmployee Listening\nWe believe in empowering our employees and providing avenues that enable their voices to be heard. We conduct a multilingual global employee survey, called \nmy\nVoice, to gain employees' feedback in a confidential manner. The CEO and Executive Leadership Team hold themselves accountable to consider and act on the results of the survey, and these results are reviewed by management with our Board of Directors. This initiative helps us gain insights on various topics including patient focus, diversity, inclusion and belonging, quality, innovation, engagement, as well as a sense of support at all levels of the organization. Speak-Up is a resource available to all employees to bring forth compliance-related concerns; a key element of our compliance program is that each employee is accountable for maintaining ethical business practices. In addition, during each quarterly global employee meeting, our CEO answers questions that have been submitted to him by employees. Answers to questions that are not covered in the townhall meeting are posted online internally.  \n10\nTable of Contents\nTotal Benefits and Well-being\nWe understand that good health leads to better performance. We offer competitive employee benefits and well-being packages that include, among other things, health and wellness insurance, health savings accounts, family support services, and a variety of site-specific programs. We regularly evaluate our benefits package to make modifications that are aligned with the competitive landscape, legislative changes, and the unique needs of our population. We also provide robust well-being programs that address prevention, nutrition, mental health, physical activity, financial fitness, and community service. As part of our regular evaluation and commitment to putting employees first, we determined our employees could benefit from support in four main areas related to health: Mind+, metabolic, heart, and musculoskeletal health. We offer a variety of programs and education to support employees in these areas. In recent years, mental well-being has become a central topic for organizations worldwide. Mind+ offers a wide variety of mental well-being programs for our employees. This commitment extends to creating a work environment where employees can feel confident speaking about mental well-being with their managers and know how best to access the tools and resources available to support them. We believe there are strong benefits when employees are feeling their best. Employees who are mentally healthy are more innovative, resilient, better decision-makers, and able to build stronger relationships. We also believe that prioritizing and promoting Mind+ allows us to help patients around the world to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives and supports employees to be their best self at home and at work.\nTalent Development\nDeveloping talent around the globe is critical to achieving our mission at Edwards. We believe in developing talent from within and have a long-term commitment to building the leadership and technical skills for the present and future needs of the business. Edwards provides in-depth learning and development resources for employees at all levels, including blended learning opportunities such as in-person, virtual, and online courses, capability assessments, coaching, and developmental experiences. We are committed to enabling our employees to have long-term careers at Edwards by encouraging each employee to take ownership of their professional development, engage in the significant resources available, and leverage the performance management and feedback process to be on a journey of continuous growth. We also encourage managers to be involved in helping their employees develop enhanced personal, professional, and leadership skills. Our learning and development strategy aims to have a balanced focus on building leadership and technical capabilities, with resources dedicated to building learning and development for global leaders, such as our course on ethical decision making for managers, and developing technical skills and capabilities for unique talent segments. Our learning and development initiatives are designed to support and sustain Edwards’ values and unique culture, inspiring our employees to collaborate, innovate, and grow, ultimately enabling us to better serve our patients.\nHeadcount and Labor Representation\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 15,800 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located in the United States, Singapore, and Costa Rica. None of our North American employees are represented by a labor union. In various countries outside of North America, we interact with trade unions and works councils that represent employees.\nAdditional details regarding talent development, compensation, and employee health and safety can be found in our Corporate Impact Report posted on our website at www.edwards.com under \"Investors — Governance & Corporate Impact.\"\nReferences to our website in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are provided for convenience only and the content on our website is not being incorporated by reference herein and does not constitute a part of this Report.\n11\nTable of Contents",
  "item7": "Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the two years ended December 31, 2024. Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2024, and our consolidated cash flows for 2024 compared to 2023. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. For a discussion related to the results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022 and a discussion related to our consolidated cash flows for 2023 compared to 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\"\n in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10–K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2024. \nOverview\nWe are the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease. Driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with the world's leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease. We conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World. Our products are categorized into the following groups: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (\"TAVR\"), Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (\"TMTT\"), and Surgical Structural Heart (\"Surgical\").  \n On June 3, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Critical Care product group (\"Critical Care\") to\nBecton, Dickinson and Company (\"BD\") in an all cash-transaction for $4.2 billion, subject to certain customary adjustments as set forth in the agreement. We completed the sale of Critical Care on September 3, 2024. We believe that the sale will enable us to pursue expanded opportunities for TAVR, TMTT, and Surgical patients, as well as new investments in interventional heart\nfailure technologies. In addition, as a next step in our disposal plan to exit businesses that are not focused on implantable\nmedical innovations for structural heart disease, we have committed to a plan to sell a non-core product group, with the sale\nexpected to occur in 2025. We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the divestiture of\nCritical Care and the aforementioned non-core product group (collectively, the \"discontinued product groups\"), including its\nsignificance to our overall net income and total assets, and determined that, when considered together, the conditions for\ndiscontinued operations presentation with respect to the discontinued product groups had been met. As such, the historical\nfinancial condition and results of the discontinued product groups have been reflected as discontinued operations in our\nconsolidated financial statements, including a $3.3 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of Critical Care. Prior period\namounts have been adjusted to reflect the discontinued operations presentation. Our discussion and analysis of our results of\noperations is reflective of our continuing operations. See Note 5 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nFinancial Highlights and Market Update\n26\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Highlights\nOur net sales for 2024 were $5.4 billion, representing an increase of $429.5 million over 2023, driven by sales growth of our TAVR and TMTT products.  \nOur gross profit increased in 2024, driven by our sales growth. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The increase in our net income and diluted earnings per share in 2024 was driven primarily by the aforementioned increase in net sales and a one-time after-tax charge of $134.9 million in 2023 related to an intellectual property agreement. See Note 3 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.  \nHealthcare Environment, Opportunities, and Challenges\nThe medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and innovations, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments. Our vision for growth is to treat patients with both valvular and non-valvular structural heart disease, such as heart failure, which is a natural progression of the disease for many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. In 2024, we invested 19% of our net sales in research and development. The following is a summary of important developments since January 1, 2024:\n•\nwe received United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approval and launched the \nEVOQUE\n tricuspid valve replacement system for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation in the United States;\n•\nwe launched the \nEdwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA\n valve in Europe;\n•\nwe announced results from the EARLY TAVR trial, the first randomized, controlled trial designed to study the best strategy for the treatment of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (\"AS\") patients and demonstrate the benefits of early intervention with TAVR;\n•\nwe announced results from the TRISCEND II trial, a randomized pivotal trial designed to study the \nEVOQUE\n system and which demonstrated superiority compared to medical therapy alone for the one-year primary endpoint;\n•\nwe completed enrollment in the CLASP II TR trial for the \nPASCAL\n tricuspid implant;\n•\nwe completed enrollment in PROGRESS, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate AS patients;\n•\nwe sold our Critical Care product group to Becton, Dickinson and Company in an all-cash transaction for $4.2 billion. The sale will enable us to pursue expanded opportunities for TAVR, TMTT, and Surgical patients, as well as new investments in interventional heart failure technologies; \n•\nwe completed the acquisition of Endotronix, Inc., a leader in heart failure management solutions;\n•\nwe completed the acquisition of Innovalve Bio Medical Ltd., an early-stage transcatheter mitral replacement company; and\n•\nwe completed the acquisition of JC Medical, Inc., an early-stage company developing a TAVR technology for patients with aortic regurgitation.\nWe are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality-of-life evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes.\n27\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales by Geographic Region\n(dollars in millions)\n \nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nUnited States\n$\n3,206.0 \n$\n2,947.9 \n$\n258.1 \n8.8 \n%\nEurope\n1,321.7 \n1,180.2 \n141.5 \n12.0 \n%\nJapan\n339.8 \n350.8 \n(11.0)\n(3.1)\n%\nRest of World\n572.0 \n531.1 \n40.9 \n7.7 \n%\nOutside of the United States\n2,233.5 \n2,062.1 \n171.4 \n8.3 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n5,439.5 \n$\n5,010.0 \n$\n429.5 \n8.6 \n%\nNet sales outside of the United States include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as further detailed in the discussion below. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and our hedging activities.

In September 2024, we received CE mark for the \nEdwards SAPIEN 3\n transcatheter pulmonary valve system with \nAlterra\n adaptive prestent for use in the management of patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation.\nTranscatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies\nThe increase in net sales of TMTT products was due primarily to higher sales of our \nPASCAL \ntranscatheter edge-to-edge repair system and our continued launch of the \nEVOQUE\n tricuspid valve replacement system in the United States and Europe. \n29\nTable of Contents\nSurgical Structural Heart\nNet sales of Surgical products increased in 2024 primarily due to higher sales of the \nINSPIRIS RESILIA\n aortic valve in the United States and Europe, the\n KONECT RESILIA \ntissue valved conduit in the United States, and the \nMITRIS RESILIA \nvalve in the United States. \nWe have completed enrollment in the United States and Canada of patients in our MOMENTIS clinical study to demonstrate the durability of \nRESILIA\n tissue in the mitral position.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit increased in 2024, driven by our sales growth discussed above. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 was driven by a 0.6 percentage point impact from foreign currency rate fluctuations, including the settlement of foreign currency hedging contracts.\n30\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General, and Administrative (\"SG&A\") Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to (a) higher field-based personnel-related costs in support of our growth strategy initiatives, primarily in the United States and Europe, (b) costs associated with our recent business combinations and (c) professional services costs to support a transition services agreement.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\") Expenses\nR&D expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to continued investments in our aortic transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity, higher personnel-related costs in support of our growth strategy initiatives, and costs associated with our recent business combinations.  \nIntellectual Property Agreement and Certain Litigation Expenses\nWe incurred certain expenses related to intellectual property litigation and tax litigation of $40.4 million and $203.5 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively. On April 12, 2023, we entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement (the \"Intellectual Property Agreement\") with Medtronic, Inc. (\"Medtronic\") and recorded a $37.0 million charge in March 2023 and a $139.0 million charge in April 2023. For more information, see Note 3 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\n31\nTable of Contents\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liabilities, net\nThe change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in gains of $26.2 million during 2023, primarily due to changes in projected probabilities of milestone achievement.  \nRestructuring Charges, Separation Costs, and Other\nIn September 2024, we recorded an expense of $32.9 million primarily related to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting approximately 360 employees. As of December 31, 2024, our remaining severance obligations of $20.1 million (included in \nAccrued and Other Liabilities\n) are expected to be substantially paid within the next 12 months.\nOn June 3, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Critical Care to BD and the sale closed on September 3, 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded expenses of $19.0 million, primarily related to costs incurred for consulting, legal, tax, and other professional advisory services associated with the sale. \nIn September 2022, we decided to exit our \nHARPOON\n surgical mitral repair system program. As a result, we recorded expenses of $62.3 million, of which $60.7 million was included in \nRestructuring Charges, Separation Costs and Other\n and $1.6 million was included in \nCost of Sales\n on the consolidated statements of operations. The charge primarily related to the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the technology for $52.7 million and other related exit costs. \nFor more information, see Note 4 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nOther Operating Income, net\nOther operating income of $0.3 million in 2024 included income from a transition services agreement of $30.3 million (see Note 5 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements)\n, partially offset by a $30.0 million charge for a charitable contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $19.8 million and $17.6 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from lower capitalizable interest related to facilities construction. \nInterest Income\nInterest income was $120.3 million and $67.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest income resulted primarily from a higher average investment balance and a higher average yield on our investments. \nOther Non-operating Income, net \n Other non-operating income was $68.9 million and $13.9 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in other income was driven primarily by gains from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interests upon acquisition\nof the investees. For more information, see Note 10 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\n \nProvision for Income Taxes\n($ in millions)\n \nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n \n2024\n \n2023\n$\n%\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n152.1 \n$\n152.4 \n$\n(0.3)\n(0.2)\n%\nEffective tax rate\n9.8 \n%\n11.1 \n%\nOur effective income tax rate in 2024 and 2023 was 9.8% and 11.1%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2024 decreased in comparison to 2023 primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates net of an increase in tax on global intangible low-taxed income and favorable global income tax audit settlements. The effective rates for 2024 and 2023 were lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to (1) foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, (2) \n32\nTable of Contents\nUnited States federal and California research and development credits, and (3) the tax benefit from employee share-based compensation.       \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $232.7 million of gross California research expenditure tax credits that we expect to use in future periods. The credits may be carried forward indefinitely. Based upon anticipated future taxable income, we expect that it is more likely than not that all California research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to be realized over an extended period of time. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided. We also had $121.6 million of United States foreign tax credits of which $103.8 million are expected to be utilized before the end of the 10-year carryforward period. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance of $17.8 million on the United States foreign tax credit carryforwards which have been determined to be unrealizable.    \nAs of December 31, 2024, our gross uncertain tax positions were $678.8 million. We estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $319.9 million from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments. The net amount of $358.9 million, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. \nIn the normal course of business, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other taxing authorities are in different stages of examining various years of our tax filings. During these audits we may receive proposed audit adjustments that could be material. Therefore, there is a possibility that an adverse outcome in these audits could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach an agreement with a tax authority at any time. While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is materially different from that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law. We believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.  \nIn the first quarter of 2022, we executed an Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) between Japan and Switzerland covering distribution transactions for tax years 2020 through 2024, and in 2023, executed an APA between Japan and the United States covering tax years 2020 through 2024. We also executed an APA in the fourth quarter of 2024 between Japan and Singapore covering tax years 2022 through 2026 with roll-back terms to cover the distribution of TAVR products beginning in 2020 and the distribution of Surgical products beginning in 2018. Also in the fourth quarter of 2024, we filed with the Japanese tax authorities an APA renewal application between Japan and the United States covering tax years 2025 through 2029. We expect to file the APA renewal application with the United States tax authorities in the first quarter of 2025.  \nThe audits of our United States federal income tax returns through 2014 have been closed. The IRS audit field work for the 2015 through 2017 tax years was completed during the second quarter of 2021, except for transfer pricing and related matters. The IRS is currently examining the 2018 through 2020 tax years.  \nThe audits of our material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2015.   \nDuring 2021, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) from the IRS for the 2015 through 2017 tax years relating to transfer pricing involving Surgical/TAVR intercompany royalty transactions between our United States and Switzerland subsidiaries. The NOPA proposed a substantial increase to our United States taxable income, which could result in additional tax expense for the 2015 through 2017 period of approximately $240.0 million and reflects a departure from a transfer pricing method we had previously agreed upon with the IRS. We disagreed with the NOPA and pursued an administrative appeal with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (\"Appeals\"). The Appeals process culminated in the third quarter of 2023 when we and Appeals concluded that a satisfactory resolution of the matter at the administrative level was not possible.    \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, Appeals issued a notice of deficiency (\"NOD\") increasing our 2015 through 2017 United States federal income tax in amounts resulting from the income adjustments previously reflected in the NOPA. The additional tax sought in excess of our filing is $269.3 million before consideration of interest and a repatriation tax offset.\nWe plan to vigorously contest the additional tax claimed by the IRS through the judicial process. Final resolution of this matter is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe the amounts previously accrued related to this uncertain tax position \n33\nTable of Contents\nare appropriate for a number of reasons, including the interpretation and application of relevant tax laws and accounting standards to our facts and, accordingly, have not accrued any additional amount based on the NOD and other proceedings to date. Nonetheless, the outcome of the judicial process cannot be predicted with certainty, and it is possible that the outcome of that process could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As noted below, similar material tax disputes may arise for the 2018 through 2024 tax years. We made deposits with the IRS of $75 million in November 2022 and $305.1 million in March 2024 to prevent the further accrual of interest on that portion of any additional tax and interest we may ultimately be found to owe while we prepare to contest through the judicial process the IRS's entitlement to any of the additional tax claimed by the IRS. The IRS converted those deposits to advance payments, and, on December 20, 2024, we filed administrative claims for refunds of those payments with the IRS for the 2015 through 2017 tax years. We expect that the IRS will either deny or fail to act on those refund claims, thereby enabling us to sue for refunds in the appropriate judicial forum.   \nSurgical/TAVR intercompany royalty transactions covering tax years 2018 through 2024 remain subject to IRS examination, and those transactions and related tax positions remain uncertain as of December 31, 2024. We have considered this information, as well as information regarding the NOD and other proceedings described above, in our evaluation of our uncertain tax positions. The impact of these unresolved transfer pricing matters, net of any correlative tax adjustments, may be significant to our consolidated financial statements. Based on the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and, therefore, have continued to record the uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.\nWe have received tax incentives in certain non-United States tax jurisdictions, the primary benefit for which will expire in 2029. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were $271.9 million ($0.45 per diluted share) and $333.2 million ($0.55 per diluted share) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we received a notice of assessment from the Israel Tax Authority (the \"ITA\") wherein the ITA claimed that we owed approximately $110 million of tax excluding interest and penalties in connection with a claimed 2017 transfer of intellectual property. We maintain that we did not transfer intellectual property outside of Israel and intend to vigorously defend that position through administrative proceedings including with a formal appeal of the assessment that was filed during the third quarter of 2024. If necessary, we expect to defend that position through judicial proceedings. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we received a notice of assessment from the ITA claiming that we owe additional tax of approximately $16 million excluding interest and penalties for the 2018 through 2022 tax years based entirely on the collateral impacts of the 2017 assessment. We plan to file a formal appeal in the first quarter of 2025 and, if necessary, expect to defend our position through judicial proceedings. There can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor and an adverse outcome could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nMany countries are implementing some or all the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two rules (\"Pillar Two\") that impose a global minimum tax of 15%. Under Pillar Two, a company is required to determine a combined effective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate is less than 15%, a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%. We are continuing to monitor the implementation of Pillar Two by individual countries and the potential effects of Pillar Two on our effective tax rate. The Pillar Two provisions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2025 and future years, depending on future legislation, regulatory guidance, and business events.\n Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under credit facilities. We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current and long-term requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments. However, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Act\") included extensive changes to the international tax regime. The 2017 Act required a deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits. The one-time transition tax liability, as adjusted, is payable in three remaining annual installments, as outlined in the contractual obligations table presented under \"\nMaterial Cash Requirements\n\" below. As of December 31, 2024, we had a remaining tax obligation of $78.5 million related to the deemed repatriation. See Note 19 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n for additional information about the one-time transition tax. \nAs of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held in the United States and outside of the United States were $3.3 billion and $658.4 million, respectively. During 2024, we repatriated cash of $2.0 billion. We assert \n34\nTable of Contents\nthat $555.2 million of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested and our intent is to repatriate, in the future, $1.0 billion of our foreign earnings as of December 31, 2024. The estimated net tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested earnings if repatriated is $2.5 million.\nWe have a Five-year Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") which provides for a $750.0 million multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility and matures on July 15, 2027. We may increase the amount available under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate and extend the maturity date for an additional year, subject to the agreement of the lenders. As of December 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nIn June 2018, we issued $600.0 million of 4.3% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (the \"2018 Notes\") due June 15, 2028. We may redeem the 2018 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at specified redemption prices. As of December 31, 2024, we have not elected to redeem any of the 2018 Notes. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the 2018 Notes was $597.7 million. For further information on our debt, see Note 12 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n. \nFrom time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. We consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock. During 2024, under the Board of Directors authorized repurchase program, we repurchased a total of 16.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion, including pursuant to a $500.0 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. For further information, see Note 16 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n. As of December 31, 2024, we had remaining authority to purchase $1.4 billion of our common stock under the share repurchase program. In addition, in February 2025, we entered into a $250.0 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. For further information, see Note 24 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nIn July 2024, we entered into agreements and plans of mergers to acquire multiple medical device companies for a total aggregate cash purchase price of $1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. Two of these transactions closed in the third quarter of 2024 and one closed in the fourth quarter of 2024. Upon closing we paid $1.1 billion, net of cash received. These agreements include up to an additional $670.0 million of potential payments upon achievement of certain regulatory, performance, and sales milestones. For further information, see Note 10 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nIn June 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Critical Care to BD in an all cash-transaction for $4.2 billion, subject to certain customary adjustments as set forth in the agreement. We completed the sale of Critical Care in early September 2024. \nOn April 12, 2023, we entered into an intellectual property agreement with Medtronic pursuant to which the parties agreed to a 15-year global covenant not to sue (\"CNS\") for infringement of certain patents in the structural heart space owned or controlled by each other. In consideration for the global CNS and related mutual access to certain intellectual property rights, we paid Medtronic a one-time, lump sum payment of $300.0 million and are making annual royalty payments that are tied to net sales of certain Edwards products. For more information, see Note 3 to the \"\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\"\nWe have purchased options to acquire and have agreed to provide promissory notes to various entities. These arrangements could result in additional cash outlays in the future should we decide to exercise the options or should the entities draw on the promissory notes. For further information, see Note 9 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n35\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Cash Flows - For the Years Ended December 31, 2024\n \nand 2023 \n \n \nNet cash flows provided by \noperating activities\n of $542.3 million for 2024 decreased $353.5 million from 2023 primarily due to tax payments of $1.2 billion in 2024, which included $469.7 million of tax payments related to the sale of Critical Care and a $305.1 million tax deposit we made to mitigate interest on potential tax liabilities we are contesting through the judicial process. For further information, see Note 19 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n. In 2023, there were tax payments of $470.1 million and a $300.0 million payment under an intellectual property agreement.\nNet cash provided by \ninvesting activities\n of $2.3 billion in 2024 consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of our Critical Care product group of $3.9 billion partially offset by payments of $1.1 billion to acquire other companies, capital expenditures of $252.4 million, and net purchases of investments of $161.4 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $173.8 million in 2023 consisted primarily of net proceeds from investments of $627.9 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $253.0 million, a payment of $95.2 million to acquire a majority interest in another company, and payments of $30.0 million for options to acquire other companies. \nWe currently anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $250.0 million in 2025 as we continue to invest in our operations.\nNet cash used in \nfinancing activities\n of $983.0 million in 2024 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $1.2 billion, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $179.5 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $711.0 million in 2023 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $879.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $169.9 million.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nA summary of our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 is as follows (in millions): \n \nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\nYear 1\nYears 2-3\nYears 4-5\nAfter 5\nYears\nDebt\n$\n600.0 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n600.0 \n$\n— \nOperating leases\n114.2 \n26.4 \n42.4 \n21.6 \n23.8 \nInterest on debt\n78.1 \n19.8 \n39.3 \n19.0 \n— \nTransition tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits (a)\n78.5 \n78.5 \n— \n— \n— \nLitigation settlement obligation (minimum payments)\n62.5 \n50.0 \n12.5 \n— \n— \nPension obligations (b)\n2.6 \n2.6 \n— \n— \n— \nPurchase and other commitments (c)\n93.1 \n41.3 \n51.8 \n— \n— \nTotal contractual cash obligations (d), (e)\n$\n1,029.0 \n$\n218.6 \n$\n146.0 \n$\n640.6 \n$\n23.8 \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(a)     As of December 31, 2024, we had recorded $78.5 million of income tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 Act. The transition tax is due in eight annual installments, with the first seven installments paid in 2018 through 2024. The remaining installment amount will be equal to 25% of the total liability \n36\nTable of Contents\npayable in 2025. See Note 19 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n for additional information about the one-time transition tax.\n(b)    The amount included in \"Year 1\" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans. Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. The total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2024 was $32.1 million. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment returns on plan assets. Therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. See Note 15 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n for further information.\n(c)    Purchase and other commitments consists primarily of open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the normal course of business. We have excluded open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year. For certain purchase and other commitments, such as commitments to fund equity method or other investments, the timing of the payment is not certain. In these cases, the maturity dates in the table reflect our best estimates.\n(d)    As of December 31, 2024, the gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest, was $786.7 million and relates primarily to transfer pricing matters. Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. In addition, we plan to vigorously contest through the judicial process the additional tax claimed by the IRS related to transfer pricing issues for the 2015 through 2017 tax years which may require additional cash outflows. See Note 19 to the\n Consolidated Financial Statements \nfor further information on these matters.\n(e)    We acquire assets still in development, enter into research and development arrangements, acquire businesses, and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone, royalty, or other future payments to third-parties, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. We have excluded from the table above those contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial, certain sales-based royalties in excess of minimum payment thresholds related to litigation settlements, and obligations under an acquisition agreement that has not yet closed. We estimate that these contingent payments could be up to $2.5 billion if all milestones or other contingent obligations are met.  \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n. Certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.\nThe application of accounting policies requires the use of judgments and estimates. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimates are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. We also use outside experts where appropriate. We apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.\nWe believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nWhen we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, the amount of consideration we ultimately receive varies depending upon the return terms, sales rebates, discounts, and other incentives that we may offer, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. The estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely upon an assessment of historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. Product returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate the variable consideration do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.\nIn addition, in limited circumstances, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products, such as for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.\nOur sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our United States distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer. We validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory. This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. We periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and involves the use of estimates and assumptions, such as projected revenues, projected gross margins, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates, expected technology life cycles, and useful lives of assets. Discount rates may vary across acquisitions based on the purchase price, forecasts, and relative risks of each acquired company. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. \nIntangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nWe acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases. The acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, projected revenues, projected gross margins, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks. Discount rates may vary across acquisitions based on the purchase price, forecasts, and relative risks of each acquired company.\nIn-process research and development assets acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. The impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.\n38\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax credits, net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings.\nWe have made an accounting policy election to recognize the United States tax effects of global intangible low-taxed income as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises.   \nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes. We review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.\nFor additional details on our income taxes, see Note 2 and Note 19 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits, including those related to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed by us, workplace and employment matters, matters involving real estate, our operations or health care regulations, or governmental investigations. We accrue for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. If we determine that a loss is possible, but not probable, and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. These matters raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal accruals. We describe our legal proceedings in Note 20 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Standards\nInformation regarding new accounting standards is included in Note 2 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements.",
