This MD&A provides only material updates to the MD&A included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K”), and therefore, should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This MD&A should also be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, and other information contained in this report.\nIn this MD&A we refer to FTE net interest income and FTE total revenue. These financial measures are not required by, or calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a further description of these non-GAAP financial measures, see the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below.\n4\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nVeritex Acquisition\nEffective October 20, 2025, Huntington completed its previously announced acquisition of Veritex Holdings, Inc. (“Veritex”), a bank holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, whereby Veritex merged with and into Huntington, with Huntington as the surviving entity. Upon completion of the merger, Huntington issued 107 million shares of its common stock to Veritex shareholders of record as of the merger date, in addition to 1 million shares issued upon the conversion of certain Veritex equity awards, resulting in total consideration from the transaction of approximately $1.7 billion. As of September 30, 2025, Veritex had $12.8 billion in assets, including $9.6 billion in loans, and $10.8 billion in deposits. \nPending Acquisition of Cadence\nOn October 27, 2025, Huntington announced entry into a definitive merger agreement with The Huntington National Bank, Huntington’s wholly owned subsidiary bank, and Cadence Bank (“Cadence”), a regional bank headquartered in Houston, Texas and Tupelo, Mississippi, whereby Cadence will merge with and into The Huntington National Bank, with The Huntington National Bank as the surviving bank. Under the terms of the agreement, Huntington will issue 2.475 shares for each outstanding share of Cadence in a 100% stock transaction. Based on Huntington’s closing price of $16.07 as of October 24, 2025, the consideration is valued at approximately $7.4 billion. Each outstanding share of 5.50% Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Cadence will be converted into the right to receive 1/1000 of a share of a newly created series of preferred stock of Huntington. As of September 30, 2025, Cadence had $53 billion in assets, including $37 billion in loans, and $44 billion in deposits. The merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including receipt of customary required regulatory approvals and the approval of the definitive merger agreement by the Huntington and Cadence shareholders.\nReporting Update\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we updated the presentation of our reported deposit categories to align more closely with how we strategically manage our business. As a result, we now report our deposit composition in the following categories: (1) demand deposits - noninterest bearing, (2) demand deposits - interest bearing, (3) money market, (4) savings, and (5) time deposits. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n5\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Performance Review\nSelected Financial Data\nTable 1 - Selected Quarterly and Year-to-Date Income Statement Data\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(amounts in millions, except per share data)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nChange\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nPercent\nInterest income\n$\n2,600 \n$\n2,555 \n$\n45 \n2 \n%\n$\n7,645 \n$\n7,411 \n$\n234 \n3 \n%\nInterest expense\n1,094 \n1,204 \n(110)\n(9)\n3,246 \n3,461 \n(215)\n(6)\nNet interest income\n1,506 \n1,351 \n155 \n11 \n4,399 \n3,950 \n449 \n11 \nProvision for credit losses\n122 \n106 \n16 \n15 \n340 \n313 \n27 \n9 \nNet interest income after provision for credit losses\n1,384 \n1,245 \n139 \n11 \n4,059 \n3,637 \n422 \n12 \nNoninterest income\n628 \n523 \n105 \n20 \n1,593 \n1,481 \n112 \n8 \nNoninterest expense\n1,246 \n1,130 \n116 \n10 \n3,595 \n3,384 \n211 \n6 \nIncome before income taxes\n766 \n638 \n128 \n20 \n2,057 \n1,734 \n323 \n19 \nProvision for income taxes\n133 \n116 \n17 \n15 \n351 \n308 \n43 \n14 \nIncome after income taxes\n633 \n522 \n111 \n21 \n1,706 \n1,426 \n280 \n20 \nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest\n4 \n5 \n(1)\n(20)\n14 \n16 \n(2)\n(13)\nNet income attributable to Huntington\n629 \n517 \n112 \n22 \n1,692 \n1,410 \n282 \n20 \nDividends on preferred shares\n27 \n36 \n(9)\n(25)\n81 \n107 \n(26)\n(24)\nNet income applicable to common shares\n$\n602 \n$\n481 \n$\n121 \n25 \n%\n$\n1,611 \n$\n1,303 \n$\n308 \n24 \n%\nAverage common shares—basic\n1,459 \n1,453 \n6 \n— \n%\n1,457 \n1,451 \n6 \n— \n%\nAverage common shares—diluted\n1,485 \n1,477 \n8 \n1 \n1,483 \n1,475 \n8 \n1 \nNet income per common share—basic\n$\n0.41 \n$\n0.33 \n$\n0.08 \n24 \n$\n1.11 \n$\n0.90 \n$\n0.21 \n23 \nNet income per common share—diluted\n0.41 \n0.33 \n0.08 \n24 \n1.09 \n0.88 \n0.21 \n24 \nCash dividends declared per common share\n0.155 \n0.155 \n— \n— \n0.465 \n0.465 \n— \n— \nReturn on average total assets\n1.19 \n%\n1.04 \n%\n1.09 \n%\n0.97 \n%\nReturn on average common shareholders’ equity\n12.4 \n10.8 \n11.6 \n10.2 \nReturn on average tangible common shareholders’ equity (1)\n17.8 \n16.2 \n16.9 \n15.5 \nNet interest margin (2)\n3.13 \n2.98 \n3.12 \n3.00 \nEfficiency ratio (3)\n57.4 \n59.4 \n58.4 \n61.2 \nRevenue and Net Interest Income—FTE (non-GAAP)\nNet interest income\n$\n1,506 \n$\n1,351 \n$\n155 \n11 \n%\n$\n4,399 \n$\n3,950 \n$\n449 \n11 \n%\nFTE adjustment (2)\n17 \n13 \n4 \n31 \n48 \n39 \n9 \n23 \nNet interest income, FTE (non-GAAP) (2)\n1,523 \n1,364 \n159 \n12 \n4,447 \n3,989 \n458 \n11 \nNoninterest income\n628 \n523 \n105 \n20 \n1,593 \n1,481 \n112 \n8 \nTotal revenue, FTE (non-GAAP) (2)\n$\n2,151 \n$\n1,887 \n$\n264 \n14 \n%\n$\n6,040 \n$\n5,470 \n$\n570 \n10 \n%\n(1)\nNet income applicable to common shares excluding expense for amortization of intangibles for the period divided by average tangible common shareholders’ equity.

FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased $159 million, or 12%, from the year-ago quarter. The increase in FTE net interest income primarily reflected a 15 basis point increase in the FTE NIM to 3.13% and a $10.8 billion, or 6%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a $10.1 billion, or 7%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The NIM increase was primarily due to a decrease in cost of funding, partially offset by a decrease in yields on earning assets and net hedging activity.\nThe provision for credit losses increased $16 million, or 15%, from the year-ago quarter to $122 million in the third quarter of 2025. The ACL increased $126 million from the year-ago quarter to $2.6 billion, or 1.86% of total loans and leases, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $2.4 billion, or 1.93% of total loans and leases, for the year-ago quarter.\nNoninterest income was $628 million, an increase of $105 million, or 20%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by a $24 million gain on the sale of a portion of our trust and custody business, included within other noninterest income, and increases in payments and cash management revenue, capital markets and advisory fees, customer deposit and loan fees, and wealth and asset management revenue. Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, an increase of $116 million, or 10%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher personnel costs and outside data processing and other services, in addition to $14 million of Veritex acquisition-related expenses recognized during the current year quarter.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and Capital Ratios as of September 30, 2025 Compared to Prior Year End\nTotal assets at September 30, 2025 were $210.2 billion, an increase of $6.0 billion, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2024. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by increases in loans and leases of $7.9 billion, or 6%, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities of $1.9 billion, or 4%. Total liabilities at September 30, 2025 were $187.9 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2024. The increase in total liabilities was primarily driven by increases in total deposits of $2.8 billion, or 2%, and long-term debt of $941 million, or 6%.\nThe tangible\n common equity to tangible assets ratio increased to 6.8% at September 30, 2025, compared to 6.1% at December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in tangible common equity from year-to-date earnings, net of dividends, and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by an increase in tangible assets. The CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.6% at September 30, 2025, compared to 10.5% at December 31, 2024, with an increase in regulatory capital from year-to-date earnings, net of dividends, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets. \nGeneral\nOur general business objectives are to: \n•\nDeliver our Culture, Purpose, and Vision through a Differentiated Operating Model;\n•\nBuild on our vision to be the leading People-First, Customer-Centered bank in the country;\n•\nDeliver top quartile performance through sustainable long-term profitable growth;\n•\nDifferentiate our culture, brand, and customer experience through expanded product offerings to drive digital acquisition, deepening, and retention, and leveraging partnerships and technology to grow customers and market share;\n•\nLeverage our regional banking model and national franchise to drive scale, growth, and expansion;\n•\nAnticipate evolving customer needs to drive profitable growth;\n•\nMaintain positive operating leverage and execute disciplined capital management; and\n•\nProvide stability and resilience through disciplined risk management, while maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n7\nTable of Contents\nOur quarterly results reflect the strength of our differentiated operating model with growth investments and continued execution of our core strategies, including leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, highlighted by growth in loans and average deposits, continued expansion of our net interest income, and strong performance in fee revenue. Our credit continues to perform well, driven by our ongoing disciplined approach to managing credit quality consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. Our approach of combining national expertise with local delivery has enabled us to accelerate organic growth across our core footprint and expand new markets and verticals, while remaining focused on delivering profitable growth and driving value for our shareholders. We believe Huntington is well positioned to outperform through a range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios. \nEconomy\nDespite persistent elevated levels of uncertainty, the market has demonstrated considerable resilience. Broad-based equity indices have been trading in proximity to record highs, while corporate credit spreads are near historically narrow levels. Tariffs continue to serve as a dynamic variable, with the potential to influence both the financial markets and the broader economic landscape.\nAt its September 2025 meeting, the Federal Reserve enacted a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate, marking the first such adjustment since December 2024. Although inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s stated 2% target and is not anticipated to fall below that threshold until 2028, the central bank cited a weakening labor market as a key reason for adopting a less restrictive monetary position.\nThroughout 2025, the labor market has faced challenges, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%. The manufacturing sector, while experiencing mild contraction, has largely stabilized and is well-positioned to benefit from renewed investment and innovation. Meanwhile, the services sector continues to show slow and steady expansion, underscoring the economy’s underlying strength. Consumer spending has remained relatively robust, supported by strong demand, even as consumer debt and delinquency rates have increased. Collectively, these indicators suggest a transitional phase rather than a downturn, with many economists now anticipating a soft landing and a return to moderate GDP growth as fiscal and monetary policies begin to support renewed momentum.\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section provides a review of financial performance on a consolidated basis. Key unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet and unaudited interim income statement trends are discussed. All earnings per share data are reported on a diluted basis.

FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the third quarter of 2025 increased $159 million, or 12%, from the third quarter of 2024. The increase in FTE net interest income primarily reflected a 15 basis point increase in the FTE NIM to 3.13% and a $10.8 billion, or 6%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a $10.1 billion, or 7%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The higher NIM was driven by lower cost of funds, partially offset by a decrease in yields on earning assets and net hedging activity.\nQuarterly Average Balance Sheet\nAverage assets for the third quarter of 2025 were $209.7 billion, an increase of $11.4 billion, or 6%, from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase in average loans and leases of $11.4 billion, or 9%. The increase in average loans and leases was driven by growth in average commercial loans and leases of $8.5 billion, or 12%, and average consumer loans of $2.9 billion, or 5%.\nAverage liabilities for the third quarter of 2025 increased $10.2 billion, or 6%, from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to increases in average deposits of $8.3 billion, or 5%, and in average total borrowings of $2.0 billion, or 12%. The increase in average deposits included an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $8.1 billion, or 6%, and an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits of $208 million, or 1%. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to increases in average money market and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average time deposits. The increase in average total borrowings was driven by holding company and bank debt issuances and CLN transactions over the last year.\nAverage shareholders’ equity for the third quarter of 2025 increased $1.2 billion, or 6%, from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to earnings, net of dividends, and improvement in average accumulated other comprehensive income driven by changes in the interest rate environment.\n10\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nYear-to-Date Average Balance Sheet / Net Interest Income \nThe following table details the change in our year-to-date average balance sheet and the net interest margin.\nTable 3 - Consolidated YTD Average Balance Sheets and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAverage\nInterest Income/Expense\nYield/\nAverage\nInterest Income/Expense\nYield/\nChange in Average Balances\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nBalances\n(FTE) (1)\nRate (2)\nBalances\n(FTE) (1)\nRate (2)\nAmount\nPercent\nAssets:\nInterest-earning deposits with banks\n$\n11,907 \n$\n402 \n4.50 \n%\n$\n11,141 \n$\n462 \n5.53 \n%\n$\n766 \n7 \n%\nSecurities:\nTrading account securities\n584 \n17 \n3.82 \n137 \n5 \n4.52 \n447 \nNM\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nTaxable\n23,913 \n811 \n4.52 \n24,049 \n949 \n5.26 \n(136)\n(1)\nTax-exempt\n3,274 \n124 \n5.06 \n2,686 \n103 \n5.12 \n588 \n22 \nTotal available-for-sale securities\n27,187 \n935 \n4.58 \n26,735 \n1,052 \n5.25 \n452 \n2 \nHeld-to-maturity securities—taxable\n16,078 \n320 \n2.65 \n15,285 \n281 \n2.45 \n793 \n5 \nOther securities\n882 \n36 \n5.43 \n777 \n30 \n5.09 \n105 \n14 \nTotal securities\n44,731 \n1,308 \n3.90 \n42,934 \n1,368 \n4.25 \n1,797 \n4 \nLoans held for sale\n742 \n36 \n6.47 \n569 \n29 \n6.77 \n173 \n30 \nLoans and leases: (3)\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial\n59,477 \n2,746 \n6.09 \n51,517 \n2,470 \n6.30 \n7,960 \n15 \nCommercial real estate\n10,831 \n555 \n6.76 \n12,155 \n700 \n7.57 \n(1,324)\n(11)\nLease financing\n5,472 \n274 \n6.61 \n5,111 \n247 \n6.35 \n361 \n7 \nTotal commercial\n75,780 \n3,575 \n6.22 \n68,783 \n3,417 \n6.53 \n6,997 \n10 \nConsumer:\nResidential mortgage\n24,412 \n762 \n4.16 \n23,898 \n700 \n3.91 \n514 \n2 \nAutomobile\n15,167 \n660 \n5.82 \n13,044 \n521 \n5.33 \n2,123 \n16 \nHome equity\n10,195 \n559 \n7.33 \n10,072 \n590 \n7.83 \n123 \n1 \nRV and marine\n5,910 \n237 \n5.35 \n5,968 \n229 \n5.13 \n(58)\n(1)\nOther consumer\n1,880 \n154 \n10.97 \n1,511 \n134 \n11.78 \n369 \n24 \nTotal consumer\n57,564 \n2,372 \n5.50 \n54,493 \n2,174 \n5.33 \n3,071 \n6 \nTotal loans and leases\n133,344 \n5,947 \n5.91 \n123,276 \n5,591 \n6.00 \n10,068 \n8 \nTotal earning assets\n190,724 \n7,693 \n5.39 \n177,920 \n7,450 \n5.59 \n12,804 \n7 \nCash and due from banks\n1,419 \n1,413 \n6 \n— \nGoodwill and other intangible assets\n5,639 \n5,686 \n(47)\n(1)\nAll other assets\n9,790 \n9,376 \n414 \n4 \nTotal assets\n$\n207,572 \n$\n194,395 \n$\n13,177 \n7 \n%\nLiabilities and shareholders’ equity:\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nDemand deposits—interest-bearing\n$\n44,755 \n$\n663 \n1.98 \n%\n$\n39,931 \n$\n649 \n2.17 \n%\n$\n4,824 \n12 \n%\nMoney market deposits\n61,111 \n1,388 \n3.04 \n53,495 \n1,515 \n3.78 \n7,616 \n14 \nSavings deposits\n15,012 \n31 \n0.28 \n15,307 \n9 \n0.08 \n(295)\n(2)\nTime deposits\n13,347 \n380 \n3.81 \n15,432 \n536 \n4.64 \n(2,085)\n(14)\nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n134,225 \n2,462 \n2.45 \n124,165 \n2,709 \n2.91 \n10,060 \n8 \nShort-term borrowings\n1,322 \n40 \n4.04 \n1,112 \n52 \n6.22 \n210 \n19 \nLong-term debt\n17,372 \n744 \n5.71 \n14,936 \n700 \n6.25 \n2,436 \n16 \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n152,919 \n3,246 \n2.84 \n140,213 \n3,461 \n3.30 \n12,706 \n9 \nDemand deposits—noninterest-bearing\n29,067 \n29,444 \n(377)\n(1)\nAll other liabilities\n4,904 \n5,160 \n(256)\n(5)\nTotal liabilities\n186,890 \n174,817 \n12,073 \n7 \nTotal Huntington shareholders’ equity\n20,636 \n19,529 \n1,107 \n6 \nNon-controlling interest\n46 \n49 \n(3)\n(6)\nTotal equity\n20,682 \n19,578 \n1,104 \n6 \nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity\n$\n207,572 \n$\n194,395 \n$\n13,177 \n7 \n%\nNet interest rate spread\n2.55 \n2.29 \nImpact of noninterest-bearing funds on margin\n0.57 \n0.71 \nNet interest margin/NII\n$\n4,447 \n3.12 \n%\n$\n3,989 \n3.00 \n%\n(1)\nFTE yields are calculated assuming a 21% tax rate.\n(2)\nAverage yield rates include the impact of applicable derivatives.

FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first nine-month period of 2025 increased $458 million, or 11%, from the year-ago period. The increase in FTE net interest income reflected a 12 basis point increase in the FTE NIM to 3.12% and a $12.8 billion, or 7%, increase in average total earning assets, partially offset by a $12.7 billion, or 9%, increase in interest-bearing liabilities. The higher NIM was driven by a lower cost of funds and an increase in average earning assets, partially offset by the decrease in yields on earning assets and an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities.\n Year-to-Date Average Balance Sheet\nAverage assets for the first nine-month period of 2025 were $207.6 billion, an increase of $13.2 billion, or 7%, from the year-ago period, primarily due to increases in average loans and leases of $10.1 billion, or 8%, and total securities of $1.8 billion, or 4%. The increase in average loans and leases included growth in average commercial loans and leases of $7.0 billion, or 10%, and average consumer loans of $3.1 billion, or 6%. \nAverage liabilities for the first nine-month period of 2025 increased $12.1 billion, or 7%, from the year-ago period, primarily due to increases in average deposits of $9.7 billion, or 6%, and in average total borrowings of $2.6 billion or 16%. Average deposits increased due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $10.1 billion, or 8%, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits of $377 million, or 1%. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was primarily driven by increases in average money market deposits and demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. The increase in average total borrowings was driven by an increase in long-term FHLB advances, debt issuances, and auto loan securitization and CLN transactions used to support asset growth.\nAverage shareholders’ equity for the first nine-month period of 2025 increased $1.1 billion, or 6%, from the year-ago period primarily due to earnings, net of dividends and improvement in average accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by the 2024 series E preferred stock redemption.\nProvision for Credit Losses\n(This section should be read in conjunction with the “\nCredit Risk\n” section.)\nThe provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2025 was $122 million, an increase of $16 million, or 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses for the first nine-month period of 2025 was $340 million, an increase of $27 million, or 9%, compared to the year-ago period. The increase in provision expense in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the third quarter of 2024, and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, compared to September 30, 2024, is reflective of loan growth, partially offset by lower reserve coverage.\nThe following table presents the components of the provision for credit losses.\nTable 4 - Provision for Credit Losses\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nProvision for loan and lease losses\n$\n118 \n$\n24 \n$\n357 \n$\n255 \nProvision (benefit) for unfunded lending commitments\n4 \n82 \n(14)\n56 \nProvision (benefit) for securities\n— \n— \n(3)\n2 \nTotal provision for credit losses\n$\n122 \n$\n106 \n$\n340 \n$\n313 \n12\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table reflects noninterest income for each of the periods presented.\nTable 5 - Noninterest Income\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2025\n2024\nPercent\n2025\n2024\nPercent\nPayments and cash management revenue\n$\n174 \n$\n158 \n10 \n%\n$\n494 \n$\n458 \n8 \n%\nWealth and asset management revenue\n104 \n93 \n12 \n307 \n271 \n13 \nCustomer deposit and loan fees\n102 \n86 \n19 \n283 \n246 \n15 \nCapital markets and advisory fees\n94 \n78 \n21 \n245 \n207 \n18 \nMortgage banking income\n43 \n38 \n13 \n102 \n99 \n3 \nLeasing revenue\n23 \n19 \n21 \n47 \n60 \n(22)\nInsurance income\n20 \n18 \n11 \n59 \n55 \n7 \nNet gains (losses) on sales of securities\n— \n— \n— \n(58)\n— \n— \nOther noninterest income\n68 \n33 \n106 \n114 \n85 \n34 \nTotal noninterest income\n$\n628 \n$\n523 \n20 \n%\n$\n1,593 \n$\n1,481 \n8 \n%\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2025 was $628 million, an increase of $105 million, or 20%, from the year-ago quarter. Other noninterest income increased $35 million, or 106%, primarily due to a $24 million gain on the sale of a portion of our trust and custody business. Payments and cash management revenue increased $16 million, or 10%, driven by higher merchant acquiring and cash management revenue. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $16 million, or 21%, primarily due to higher syndication and advisory fees. Customer deposit and loan fees increased $16 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher loan commitment fees. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $11 million, or 12%, primarily due to higher trust and investment management income. \nNoninterest income for the first nine-month period of 2025 increased $112 million, or 8%, from the year-ago period. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $38 million, or 18%, primarily due to higher syndication fees and commercial loan production related activities. Customer deposit and loan fees increased $37 million, or 15%, primarily reflecting higher loan commitment fees. Payments and cash management revenue increased $36 million, or 8%, reflecting higher merchant acquiring, commercial treasury management, and card transaction revenue. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $36 million, or 13%, reflecting higher trust and investment management account income. Other noninterest income increased $29 million, or 34%, primarily due to a $24 million gain on the sale of a portion of our trust and custody business. Partially offsetting these increases, net gains (losses) on sales of securities included $58 million of net loss on sale of securities as a result of corporate debt securities repositioning in the second quarter of 2025, and leasing revenue decreased  $13 million, or 22%, driven by lower operating lease income.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n13\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table reflects noninterest expense for each of the periods presented.\n \nTable 6 - Noninterest Expense\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2025\n2024\nPercent\n2025\n2024\nPercent\nPersonnel costs\n$\n757 \n$\n684 \n11 \n%\n$\n2,150 \n$\n1,986 \n8 \n%\nOutside data processing and other services\n198 \n167 \n19 \n550 \n498 \n10 \nEquipment\n66 \n65 \n2 \n201 \n197 \n2 \nNet occupancy\n57 \n57 \n— \n176 \n165 \n7 \nMarketing\n34 \n33 \n3 \n91 \n88 \n3 \nDeposit and other insurance expense\n9 \n15 \n(40)\n66 \n94 \n(30)\nProfessional services\n31 \n21 \n48 \n75 \n72 \n4 \nAmortization of intangibles\n11 \n11 \n— \n33 \n35 \n(6)\nLease financing equipment depreciation\n4 \n4 \n— \n10 \n12 \n(17)\nOther noninterest expense\n79 \n73 \n8 \n243 \n237 \n3 \nTotal noninterest expense\n$\n1,246 \n$\n1,130 \n10 \n%\n$\n3,595 \n$\n3,384 \n6 \n%\nNumber of employees (average full-time equivalent)\n20,247 \n20,043 \n1 \n%\n20,198 \n19,896 \n2 \n%\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2025 was $1.2 billion, an increase of $116 million, or 10%, from the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2025 included $14 million of Veritex acquisition-related expenses, primarily within professional services. Personnel costs increased $73 million, or 11%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and salary expense. Outside data processing and other services increased $31 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher technology and data expense. \nNoninterest expense for the first nine-month period of 2025 increased $211 million, or 6%, from the year-ago period. Personnel costs increased $164 million, or 8%, primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and salary expense, partially offset by a decline in benefits expense. Outside data processing increased $52 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher technology and data expense. Partially offsetting these increases, deposit and other insurance expense decreased $28 million, or 30%, primarily due to a $6 million benefit, compared to $31 million of additional expense, attributable to the ongoing adjustments related to the FDIC DIF special assessment recognized in the first nine-month periods of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2025 was $133 million, compared to $116 million in the third quarter of 2024. The provision for income taxes for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 was $351 million and $308 million, respectively. All periods included the benefits from general business credits, tax-exempt income, tax-exempt bank-owned life insurance income, and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. The effective tax rates for the third quarter of 2025 and third quarter of 2024 were 17.4% and 18.2%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 were 17.0% and 17.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the third quarter of 2024, and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to increased benefits from general business credit and the benefits of capital losses recognized. \nThe net federal deferred tax asset was $712 million, and the net state deferred tax asset was $107 million at September 30, 2025. \nWe file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2019. The 2020-2024 tax years remain open under the statute of limitations. Also, with few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state, city, or foreign income tax examinations for tax years before 2020.\n14\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nOur Risk Governance Framework and Risk Appetite Statement are foundational to our risk management program. Risk Governance Framework defines the three lines of defense structure, roles, responsibilities, and requirements. The Risk Appetite Statement is approved by our Board and defines the level and types of risks we are willing to assume to achieve our corporate objectives through defined risk limits for the seven key risk categories to which we are exposed: credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. More information on our risk management can be found in \nItem 1A Risk Factors\n, the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequent filings with the SEC. Our definition, philosophy, and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. A number of other products expose the Company to credit risk, including investment securities and derivatives. The credit exposure of our derivatives is limited to the aggregate sum of net asset values with counterparties in which we are in a net asset position. Potential credit losses are mitigated by derivatives through central clearing parties, careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing, selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions, collateral agreements, and other contract provisions.\nWe focus on the early identification, monitoring, and management of all aspects of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities that utilize external data sources, enhanced modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. Our disciplined portfolio management processes are central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. In our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers.\nLoan and Lease Credit Exposure Mix\nRefer to the “\nLoan and Lease Credit Exposure Mix\n” section of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of each portfolio segment. \nAt September 30, 2025, our loans and leases totaled $138.0 billion, representing a $7.9 billion, or 6%, increase compared to $130.0 billion at December 31, 2024. \nThe table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio. \nTable 7 - Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n62,978 \n45 \n%\n$\n56,809 \n43 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n10,732 \n8 \n11,078 \n9 \nLease financing\n5,515 \n4 \n5,454 \n4 \nTotal commercial\n79,225 \n57 \n73,341 \n56 \nConsumer:\nResidential mortgage\n24,502 \n18 \n24,242 \n19 \nAutomobile\n15,996 \n12 \n14,564 \n11 \nHome equity\n10,314 \n7 \n10,142 \n8 \nRV and marine\n5,805 \n4 \n5,982 \n5 \nOther consumer\n2,114 \n2 \n1,771 \n1 \nTotal consumer\n58,731 \n43 \n56,701 \n44 \nTotal loans and leases\n$\n137,956 \n100 \n%\n$\n130,042 \n100 \n%\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n15\nTable of Contents\nOur loan and lease portfolio is a managed mix of consumer and commercial credits. We manage the overall credit exposure and portfolio composition via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. Commercial lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures, and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. As of September 30, 2025, there were no identified concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the ROC and is used to ensure a high quality, well-diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. Changes to existing concentration limits and incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation. \nThe table below provides our total loan and lease portfolio segregated by industry type.

The CRE portfolio had an associated allowance coverage of 3.9% and 4.3% at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. \nWith declines in demand and property values of office space across the country, the office sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. Our office portfolio, which is predominantly suburban and multi-tenant loans, totaled $1.4 billion, or 1% of total loans and leases, as of September 30, 2025, compared to $1.6 billion, or 1% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2024. We have established ACL reserves of approximately 11% for our CRE office portfolio at both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2025, there was $15 million of outstanding balances in the office portfolio that were 30 or more days past due.\nCredit Quality\n(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 - “\nLoans and Leases\n” and Note 6 - “\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n” of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nWe believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NALs and NPAs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, product segmentation, and origination trends in the analysis of our credit quality performance.\nCredit quality performance in the third quarter of 2025 reflected NCOs of $75 million, or 0.22% of average total loans and leases, annualized, a decrease of $18 million, compared to $93 million, or 0.30%, in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects an $18 million decrease in commercial NCOs to $36 million in the third quarter of 2025. NPAs decreased from December 31, 2024 by $1 million, which included a $28 million decrease in other NPAs, partially offset by increases in residential mortgage of $14 million and commercial real estate of $13 million.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n17\nTable of Contents\nNALs and NPAs\nThe following table presents the details of our NALs and NPAs.\nTable 11 - Nonaccrual Loans and Leases and Nonperforming Assets\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nNonaccrual loans and leases (NALs):\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n455 \n$\n457 \nCommercial real estate\n131 \n118 \nLease financing\n10 \n10 \nResidential mortgage\n97 \n83 \nAutomobile\n6 \n6 \nHome equity\n108 \n107 \nRV and marine\n1 \n2 \nTotal nonaccrual loans and leases\n808 \n783 \nOther real estate, net\n10 \n8 \nOther NPAs (1)\n3 \n31 \nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\n821 \n$\n822 \nNonaccrual loans and leases as a % of total loans and leases\n0.59 \n%\n0.60 \n%\nNPA ratio (2)\n0.60 \n0.63 \n(1)    Other nonperforming assets include certain impaired investment securities and/or nonaccrual loans held-for-sale.\n(2)    Nonperforming assets divided by the sum of loans and leases, other real estate owned, and other NPAs.\nACL\nOur ACL is comprised of two different components, the ALLL and the AULC, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio. We utilize an independent third-party baseline forecast that projects future economic conditions and considers multiple macroeconomic scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables that are influential to our modeling process, the most significant being unemployment rates and GDP.\nThe baseline economic scenario used in the September 30, 2025 ACL determination assumes continued tariff uncertainty, but reflects marginal improved performance of the U.S. economy in the near term with minimal change in the overall outlook. In this scenario, the unemployment rate is expected to end 2025 at 4.4%, with peak unemployment of 4.8% through the end of 2026. The Federal Reserve restarted rate cuts in the third quarter of 2025 and is expected to continue with future rate cuts until reaching the federal funds rate of 3% by the end of 2026. The inflation outlook deteriorates slightly as the impacts of tariffs and other trade policies are expected to cascade through the economy, with near-term inflation expected to rise further above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target until the rate begins to decline in the second half of 2026 but still remaining above target. GDP growth, while positive, has slowed to a current level of approximately 1% and is forecasted to remain below 2% through the end of 2026.\nThe table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of unemployment and GDP in the baseline scenario has changed since the end of 2024.\nTable 12 - Forecasted Key Macroeconomic Variables\n2024\n2025\n2026\nBaseline scenario forecast\nQ4\nQ2\nQ4\nQ2\nQ4\nUnemployment rate (1)\n4Q 2024\n4.2 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n3Q 2025\nN/A\nN/A\n4.4 \n4.6 \n4.8 \nGross Domestic Product (1)\n4Q 2024\n2.0 \n%\n2.1 \n%\n2.1 \n%\n1.9 \n%\n2.2 \n%\n3Q 2025\nN/A\nN/A\n1.0 \n1.5 \n1.4 \n(1)    Values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented, not updated for subsequent actual amounts.\n18\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nManagement continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including ongoing risks in the commercial real estate environment, current inflation levels, the impacts of U.S. trade policies including tariffs, political uncertainty, and geopolitical instability, considering multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflect a range of possible outcomes. While we have incorporated estimates of economic uncertainty into our ACL, the ultimate impact that specific challenges will have on the economy remains unknown.\nManagement develops additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results. Our Allowance for Credit Loss Development Methodology Committee reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage, concluding that the quantitative transaction reserve will continue to utilize scenario weighting. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the September 30, 2025 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components, including profiles to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. \nThe most significant risk profiles the Company maintains at September 30, 2025 relate to business banking loans within the C&I portfolio and office loans within the CRE portfolio. The business banking risk profile addresses a modest upward trend in default rates resulting from the current interest rate environment and inflationary impacts on business banking customers. The office portfolio risk profile addresses concerns relating to the current interest rate environment, upcoming maturities, falling property values, and uncertainty about demand for office space.\nOur ACL evaluation process includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics and a comparison of certain ACL benchmarks to current performance.\nThe table below reflects the allocation of our ACL among our various loan and lease categories as well as certain coverage metrics of the reported ALLL and ACL.\nTable 13 - Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nAllocation of Allowance\n% of Total ALLL\n% of Total Loans and Leases (1) \nAllocation of Allowance\n% of Total ALLL\n% of Total Loans and Leases (1) \nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n1,084 \n45 \n%\n45 \n%\n$\n947 \n42 \n%\n43 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n419 \n18 \n8 \n473 \n21 \n9 \nLease financing\n65 \n3 \n4 \n64 \n3 \n4 \nTotal commercial\n1,568 \n66 \n57 \n1,484 \n66 \n56 \nConsumer\nResidential mortgage\n204 \n9 \n18 \n205 \n9 \n19 \nAutomobile\n172 \n7 \n12 \n145 \n6 \n11 \nHome equity\n160 \n7 \n7 \n148 \n7 \n8 \nRV and marine\n141 \n6 \n4 \n150 \n7 \n5 \nOther consumer\n129 \n5 \n2 \n112 \n5 \n1 \nTotal consumer\n806 \n34 \n43 \n760 \n34 \n44 \nTotal ALLL\n2,374 \n2,244 \nAULC\n188 \n202 \nTotal ACL\n$\n2,562 \n$\n2,446 \nTotal ALLL as a % of\nTotal loans and leases\n1.72 \n%\n1.73 \n%\nNonaccrual loans and leases\n294 \n286 \nNPAs\n289 \n273 \nTotal ACL as % of\nTotal loans and leases\n1.86 \n%\n1.88 \n%\nNonaccrual loans and leases\n317 \n312 \nNPAs\n312 \n297 \n(1)\nPercentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n19\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2025, the ACL was $2.6 billion, or 1.86% of total loans and leases, compared to $2.4 billion, or 1.88%, at December 31, 2024. The increase in the ACL was driven by loan and lease growth, partially offset by a modest reduction in the ACL coverage ratio.

Annualized consumer loan NCOs of 0.27% were consistent with the year-ago period.\n20\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers, and secondarily to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans.\nWe measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models, which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates. Models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve, the direction and volatility of interest rates, and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior. Our models incorporate market-based assumptions that include the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates of assets and runoff rates of deposits. The models also include our projections of the future volume and pricing of various business lines. \nIn measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet, we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates. The market forward rates reflect the general market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types: “shock” scenarios, which are immediate parallel rate shifts, and “ramp” scenarios, where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first 12 months of the forecast on a pro-rata basis. In both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates, we presume that market rates will not go below 0%. The scenarios include all executed interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward-starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon.\nA key driver of our interest rate risk profile is our interest-bearing deposit repricing sensitivity assumptions to changes in interest rates, otherwise known as deposit beta. In addition, our interest expense is impacted by the composition of both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits in relation to our total deposits. Accordingly, we consider the impacts from both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits on our total deposit beta. Following the start of the current falling rate cycle, which began in the third quarter of 2024, our cumulative total deposit beta (total cost of deposits) was 32%.\nWe use two approaches to model interest rate risk: net interest income at risk (NII at Risk) and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis (EVE at Risk).\nNII at Risk is used by management to measure the risk and impact to earnings over the next 12 months, using a wide range of interest rate scenarios, including instantaneous and gradual, as well as parallel and non-parallel, changes in interest rates. The NII at Risk results included in the table below presents select gradual “ramp” -200, -100, +100, and +200 basis point parallel shift scenarios, implied by the forward yield curve over the next 12 months. \nTable 15 - Net Interest Income at Risk\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nFederal Funds Rate\nFederal Funds Rate\nBasis point change scenario\nStarting Point\nMonth 12 (1)\nNII at Risk (%)\nStarting Point\nMonth 12 (1)\nNII at Risk (%)\n+200\n4.25 \n%\n5.25 \n%\n1.7 \n%\n4.50 \n%\n6.00 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n+100\n4.25 \n4.25 \n0.4 \n4.50 \n5.00 \n0.8 \nBase\n4.25 \n3.25 \n— \n4.50 \n4.00 \n— \n-100\n4.25 \n2.25 \n-0.5 \n4.50 \n3.00 \n-0.5 \n-200\n4.25 \n1.25 \n-1.8 \n4.50 \n2.00 \n-1.3 \n(1)\nRepresents the federal funds rate in month 12 given a gradual, parallel “ramp” relative to the base implied forward scenario.\nThe NII at Risk shows that the balance sheet is asset-sensitive at both September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024. The primary drivers to the change in sensitivity \nfrom December 31, 2024 \ninclude current and projected balance sheet composition over the simulation horizon and market rates. \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n21\nTable of Contents\nEVE at Risk is used by management to measure the impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures, using a wide range of scenarios. The EVE results included in the table below presents select immediate -200, -100, +100, and +200 basis point parallel “shock” scenarios from the yield curve term points at the specific point in time that EVE sensitivity is measured. \nTable 16 - Economic Value of Equity at Risk\n \nEconomic Value of Equity at Risk (%)\nBasis point change scenario\n-200\n-100\n+100\n+200\nAt September 30, 2025\n-0.4 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n-3.2 \n%\n-7.7 \n%\nAt December 31, 2024\n5.9 \n4.3 \n-5.8 \n-12.6 \n The change in sensitivity from December 31, 2024 was driven\n primarily by market rates and changes to actual balance sheet composition. \nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk\nAn integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, swaptions, floors, forward contracts, and forward-starting interest rate swaps, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. These instruments provide flexibility in adjusting Huntington’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding requirements.\nTable 17 shows all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates. The interest rate variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or the cash flows attributable to net interest margin. These positions are used to protect the fair value of assets and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. The positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable-rate index into a fixed rate. The volume, maturity, and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 14 - “\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n” of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. \n22\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Huntington’s asset and liability management activities.\nTable 17 - Information on Asset Liability Management Instruments\n Weighted-Average Maturity (years)\nWeighted-Average\nFixed Rate\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nNotional Value\nFair Value\nAt September 30, 2025\nAsset conversion swaps\nSecurities (1):\nPay Fixed - Receive SOFR\n$\n4,127 \n4.0 \n$\n130 \n2.43 \n%\nPay Fixed - Receive SOFR - forward-starting (2)\n1,160 \n12.7 \n26 \n3.36 \nLoans:\nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR\n15,300 \n2.3 \n(28)\n3.17 \nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR - forward-starting (3)\n1,000 \n4.0 \n8 \n3.48 \nLiability conversion swaps\nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR\n10,599 \n3.2 \n(11)\n3.51 \nPurchased floor spreads (4)\nPurchased Floor Spread - SOFR \n6,000 \n1.1 \n21 \n2.79 / 3.87\nPurchased Floor Spread - SOFR forward-starting (3)\n3,950 \n3.6 \n63 \n2.84 / 3.84\nBasis swaps (5)\nPay SOFR- Receive Fed Fund (economic hedges)\n174 \n0.8 \n— \n4.27 \nPay Fed Fund - Receive SOFR (economic hedges) \n1 \n10.1 \n— \n4.40 \nTotal swap portfolio\n$\n42,311 \n$\n209 \nAt December 31, 2024\nAsset conversion swaps\nSecurities (1):\nPay Fixed - Receive SOFR\n$\n10,059 \n1.9 \n$\n407 \n1.38 \n%\nPay Fixed - Receive SOFR - forward-starting (6)\n928 \n7.5 \n45 \n2.81 \nLoans:\nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR\n10,075 \n2.2 \n(255)\n2.75 \nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR - forward-starting (7)\n7,225 \n4.0 \n(75)\n3.62 \nLiability conversion swaps\nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR\n7,272 \n3.2 \n(197)\n3.30 \nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR - forward-starting (7)\n4,075 \n4.6 \n(56)\n3.64 \nPurchased floor spreads (4)\nPurchased Floor Spread - SOFR\n6,000 \n1.8 \n24 \n2.79 / 3.87\nBasis swaps (5)\nPay SOFR- Receive Fed Fund (economic hedges) \n174 \n1.6 \n— \n5.19 \nPay Fed Fund - Receive SOFR (economic hedges) \n1 \n10.8 \n— \n5.24 \nTotal swap portfolio\n$\n45,809 \n$\n(107)\n(1)\nAmounts include interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed rate investment securities using the portfolio layer method.\n(2)\nForward-starting swaps effective starting from February 2026 to October 2027.\n(3)\nForward-starting swaps and forward-starting floor spreads effective starting from October 2025 to June 2026.\n(4)\nThe weighted-average fixed rates for floor spreads are the weighted-average strike rates for the upper and lower bounds of the instruments.\n(5)\nBasis swaps have variable pay and variable receive resets.

When we purchase credit protection, such as a CDS, we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs. \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n23\nTable of Contents\nMSRs\n(This section should be read in conjunction with \nNote\n 7 - “\nMortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights\n” of \nNotes to\n Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\n.)\nAt September 30, 2025, we had a total of $576 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $34.4 billion in mortgage loans. \nMSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. We report changes in the MSR value net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. \nMSR assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. \nPrice Risk\nPrice risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, derivative instruments, and equity investments. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The goal of liquidity management is to ensure adequate, stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to satisfy changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals, investment opportunities, and other contractual obligations. We consider core earnings, strong capital ratios, and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings, which allows us cost-effective access to market-based liquidity. We mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining a large, stable customer deposit base and a diversified base of readily available wholesale funding sources, including secured funding sources from the FHLB and FRB through pledged borrowing capacity, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. We further mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and securities.\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for establishing an acceptable level of liquidity risk at Huntington, including approval of the liquidity risk appetite at least annually. The liquidity risk appetite includes liquidity risk metrics that are designed and monitored to ensure Huntington maintains adequate liquidity to meet current and future funding needs, including during periods of potential stress. The Board receives and reviews information on at least a semi-annual basis to ensure Huntington is operating in accordance with its established risk tolerance. Further, the ALCO is appointed by the ROC to oversee liquidity risk management, including the establishment of liquidity risk policies and additional liquidity risk metrics and limits to support our overall liquidity risk appetite. \nLiquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the Bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, contingency funding plans. At September 30, 2025, management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet Huntington’s on and off-balance sheet obligations. \n24\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nWe maintain a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the potential erosion of funds in the event of an institution-specific event or systemic financial market crisis. Examples of institution-specific events could include a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency, a large charge to earnings, declines in profitability or other financial measures, declines in liquidity sources including reductions in deposit balances or access to contingent funding sources, or a significant merger or acquisition. Examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, failure of a major financial institution, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund, or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation or rumors about us, or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. The contingency funding plan, which is reviewed and approved by the ROC at least annually, outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis and provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period and outlines early warning indicators that are used to monitor emerging liquidity stress events.\nDeposits\nOur largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is customer deposits, which provide stable and lower-cost funding. Our customer deposits come from a base of primary bank customer relationships, and we continue to focus on acquiring and deepening those relationships, resulting in a diversified deposit base. Total deposits were $165.2 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $162.4 billion at December 31, 2024. The $2.8 billion, or 2%, increase in total deposits, compared to December 31, 2024, was driven by increases in interest-bearing demand and money market deposits, partially offset by lower time and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Total deposits included $7.0 billion of brokered deposits primarily consisting of brokered money market balances at both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The level of brokered deposits was below our established liquidity risk metric limits at September 30, 2025.\nInsured deposits comprised approximately 70% and 69% of our total deposits at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The composition of our deposits is presented in the table below.\nTable 18 - Deposit Composition\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nBy type:\nDemand deposits—noninterest-bearing\n$\n28,596 \n17 \n%\n$\n29,345 \n18 \n%\nDemand deposits—interest-bearing\n46,056 \n28 \n43,378 \n27 \nMoney market deposits\n62,837 \n38 \n60,730 \n37 \nSavings deposits\n14,986 \n9 \n14,723 \n9 \nTime deposits\n12,737 \n8 \n14,272 \n9 \nTotal deposits\n$\n165,212 \n100 \n%\n$\n162,448 \n100 \n%\nTotal deposits (insured/uninsured):\nInsured deposits\n$\n115,978 \n70 \n%\n$\n112,394 \n69 \n%\nUninsured deposits (1)\n49,234 \n30 \n50,054 \n31 \nTotal deposits\n$\n165,212 \n100 \n%\n$\n162,448 \n100 \n%\n(1)\nRepresents consolidated Huntington uninsured deposits, determined by adjusting the amounts reported in the Bank Call Report (FFIEC 031) by inter-company deposits, which are not customer deposits and are therefore eliminated through consolidation. As of September 30, 2025, the Bank Call Report estimated uninsured deposit balance was $53.7 billion, which includes $4.5 billion of inter-company deposits. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank Call Report estimated uninsured deposit balance was $54.6 billion, which includes $4.5 billion of inter-company deposits. \nWholesale Funding\nSources of wholesale funding include non-customer brokered deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. Our wholesale funding totaled $24.6 billion at September 30, 2025, an increase of $1.0 billion compared to $23.6 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase from year end was primarily due to a $941 million increase in long-term debt resulting from the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior bank notes, and $830 million of CLN transactions completed during 2025, partially offset by maturities and repayments.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n25\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investment Securities\nCash and cash equivalents were $12.7 billion and $12.8 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nOur investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established ALCO objectives. Changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio, as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure.\nTotal investment securities were $41.8 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $43.7 billion at December 31, 2024. The $1.9 billion decrease in investment securities, compared to December 31, 2024, was largely driven by maturing investment securities in the third quarter of 2025 not being reinvested, partially offset by an improvement in unrealized losses on AFS securities. At September 30, 2025, the duration of the investment securities portfolio, net of hedging, was 4.2 years. Securities are pledged to secure borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, discussed further in the \nBank Liquidity and Sources of Funding\n section below. \nBank Liquidity and Sources of Funding\nOur primary source of funding for the Bank is customer deposits. At September 30, 2025, customer deposits funded 75% of total assets (115% of total loans and leases). To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through customer deposits, cash and cash equivalents, and investment securities, we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding and asset securitization or sale. Additionally, the Bank may also access funding through intercompany notes or parent company deposits placed at the Bank.\nThe Bank maintains borrowing capacity at both the FHLB and the FRB secured by pledged loans and securities. While the Bank does not consider borrowing capacity at the FRB a primary source of funding, it could be used as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. The amount of available contingent borrowing capacity may fluctuate based on the level of borrowings outstanding and level of assets pledged.\nA summary of the Bank’s selected contingent liquidity sources is presented in the following table.\nTable 19 - Selected Contingent Liquidity Sources\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nUnused secured borrowing capacity:\nFRB\n$\n70,312 \n$\n70,020 \nFHLB\n16,856 \n15,524 \nUnpledged investment securities (at market value)\n10,527 \n5,786 \nInterest-earning deposits held at FRB\n11,042 \n11,162 \nSelected contingent liquidity sources\n$\n108,737 \n$\n102,492 \nAs of September 30, 2025, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\nParent Company Liquidity\nThe parent company’s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities.\nThe parent company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion at both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n26\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nOn October 15, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.155 per common share. The common stock dividend is payable on January 2, 2026, to shareholders of record on December 18, 2025. Additionally, on October 15, 2025, our Board of Directors declared quarterly Series B, F, G, H, J, and K preferred stock dividends payable on January 15, 2026 to shareholders of record on January 1, 2026. On September 9, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend for the Series I preferred stock payable on December 1, 2025 to shareholders of record on November 15, 2025. Current quarterly dividend declarations are expected to total approximately $269 million. \nDuring the first nine months of 2025, the Bank paid common and preferred dividends to the parent company of $750 million and $34 million, respectively. To meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities. To support the parent company’s ability to issue debt or equity securities, we have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC covering an indeterminate amount or number of securities to be offered or sold from time to time as authorized by Huntington’s Board of Directors.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings represent evaluations by rating agencies based on a number of factors, including financial strength and the ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. Credit ratings are subject to change at any time. Our credit ratings impact our availability and cost of financing, as well as collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and deposit products. A downgrade to our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital, increase our cost of funds, or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements. \nThe following table presents our credit ratings and rating agency outlooks.\nTable 20 - Credit Ratings and Outlook\n \nAt September 30, 2025\nMoody’s\nStandard & Poor’s\nFitch\nDBRS Morningstar\nHuntington Bancshares Incorporated\nSenior unsecured notes\nBaa1\nBBB+\nA-\nA\nSubordinated notes\nBaa1\nBBB\nBBB+\nA (low)\nCommercial paper\nNR\nNR\nF1\nR-1 (low)\nRatings outlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nStable\nThe Huntington National Bank\nSenior unsecured notes\nA3\nA-\nA-\nA (high)\nLong-term deposits\nA1\nNR (1)\nA\nA (high)\nShort-term deposits\nP-1\nNR (1)\nF1\nR-1 (middle)\nRatings outlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nStable\nNR - Not Rated\n(1) Standard & Poor’s does not provide a depositor rating. The Bank’s issuer credit rating is A-. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations and commitments that could impact our liquidity and capital resources. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, floors, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans, operating lease payments, and other purchase and marketing obligations. \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n27\nTable of Contents\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss due to human error, third-party performance failures, or inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, failed business contingency plans, and security risks. We continuously strive to test and strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts, agreements, laws, rules, and regulations, and to reduce our exposure to fraud and improve the oversight of our operational risk. \nTo govern operational risks, we have an Operational Risk Committee, a Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee, a Funds Movement Committee, a Fraud Risk Committee, an Information and Technology Risk Committee, an Artificial Intelligence Risk Committee, and a Third Party Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. These committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be escalated to our ROC and our Audit Committee, as appropriate. \nThe goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk monitoring; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models; and enhance our overall performance.\nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity represents an important component of Huntington’s overall cross-functional approach to risk management. We actively manage a cybersecurity operation designed to detect, contain, and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents in a prompt and effective manner with the goal of minimizing disruptions to our business. We actively monitor cyberattacks, such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate our technology, processes, and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and increase across the entire digital landscape. We actively monitor our environment for malicious content and implement specific cybersecurity and fraud capabilities, including the monitoring of phishing email campaigns. In addition, we have implemented specific cybersecurity and fraud monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins, since a significant portion of our workforce works remotely from time-to-time. \nOur objective for managing cybersecurity risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of both internal and external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. To this end, we employ a set of defense-in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cybersecurity may be escalated to our board-level ROC and/or Technology Committee, as appropriate. \nAs a complement to the overall cybersecurity risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates, to ensure awareness of the risks of cybersecurity threats at all levels across the organization. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management framework, and any such third-parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality. \n28\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nCompliance Risk\nFinancial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. These broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. As such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. We hold ourselves to a high standard for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance.\nCAPITAL \nOur primary capital objective is to maintain appropriate levels of capital within our Board-approved risk appetite to support the Bank’s operations, absorb unanticipated losses and declines in asset values, and provide protection to uninsured depositors and debt holders in the event of liquidation, while also funding organic growth and providing appropriate returns to our shareholders. We manage regulatory capital and shareholders’ equity at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active program for managing capital, and we maintain a comprehensive process for assessing our overall capital adequacy, including the monitoring and reporting of capital risk metrics to the Board and ROC that we believe are useful for evaluating capital adequacy and making capital decisions. In addition to as-reported regulatory capital and tangible common equity metrics, we also actively monitor other measures of capital, such as tangible common equity including the mark-to-market impact on HTM securities and CET1 including the impact of AOCI excluding cash flow hedges. We believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders’ equity are adequate. \nThe following table presents certain regulatory capital data at both the consolidated and Bank level.\nTable 21 - Regulatory Capital Data (1)\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nConsolidated:\nCET1 risk-based capital ratio\n10.6 \n%\n10.5 \n%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio\n12.4 \n11.9 \nTotal risk-based capital ratio\n14.7 \n14.3 \nTier 1 leverage ratio\n9.0 \n8.6 \nCET1 risk-based capital\n$\n15,924 \n$\n15,127 \nTier 1 risk-based capital\n18,665 \n17,126 \nTotal risk-based capital\n22,022 \n20,565 \nTotal risk-weighted assets\n150,219 \n143,650 \nBank:\nCET1 risk-based capital ratio\n11.7 \n%\n11.6 \n%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio\n12.5 \n12.4 \nTotal risk-based capital ratio\n14.1 \n14.1 \nTier 1 leverage ratio\n9.1 \n8.9 \nCET1 risk-based capital\n$\n17,546 \n$\n16,540 \nTier 1 risk-based capital\n18,747 \n17,746 \nTotal risk-based capital\n21,161 \n20,240 \nTotal risk-weighted assets\n149,578 \n143,128 \n(1)    Huntington elected to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital pursuant to a rule that allowed BHCs and banks to delay the impact of adopting CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period which began January 1, 2022. As of September 30, 2025, the impact of the CECL deferral was fully phased in, while 75% of the impact of the CECL deferral was phased in at December 31, 2024.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n29\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2025, Huntington and the Bank maintained capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the Federal Reserve. Consolidated CET1 risk-based capital ratio increased to 10.6% at September 30, 2025, compared to 10.5% at December 31, 2024, as current period earnings, net of dividends, were partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets. The increase in risk-weighted assets was driven by loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the 2025 first and third quarter CLN transactions and the 2025 second quarter investment securities repositioning. \nWe are authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the Federal Reserve’s capital rule, including the SCB requirement. Our SCB requirement is 2.5%. \nShareholders’ Equity\nWe generate shareholders’ equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases. Other potential sources of shareholders’ equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. \nShareholders’ equity totaled $22.2 billion at September 30, 2025, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 13%, when compared with December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by earnings, net of dividends, an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income driven by changes in interest rates, and the issuance of $741 million of perpetual preferred stock in the third quarter of 2025.\nShare Repurchases\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when our Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. \nOn April 16, 2025, our Board approved the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of common shares. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs, and is subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital regulations. The timing of repurchases will be discretionary and depend on several factors, including the macroeconomic and interest rate environment, and the pace of loan growth. No shares have been repurchased under the current repurchase authorization. \nBUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION\nOverview\nOur business segments are based on our internally aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. We have two business segments: Consumer & Regional Banking and Commercial Banking. All other items not included within our two business segments are reported within the Treasury / Other function, which primarily includes technology and operations and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. \nBusiness segment results are determined based on our management practices, which assign balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions.\nRevenue Sharing\nRevenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee-sharing allocations.\n30\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nExpense Allocation\nThe management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to the business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the business segments.\nFunds Transfer Pricing (FTP)\nWe use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities). The primary components of the FTP rate include a base (market) rate, a liquidity premium, contingent liquidity and collateral charges, and option cost.\nNet Income (Loss) by Business Segment\nNet income (loss) by business segment is presented in the following table.\nTable 22 - Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment\n \nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nConsumer & Regional Banking\n$\n998 \n$\n1,098 \nCommercial Banking\n893 \n853 \nTreasury / Other\n(199)\n(541)\nNet income attributable to Huntington\n$\n1,692 \n$\n1,410 \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n31\nTable of Contents\nConsumer & Regional Banking\nTable 23 - Key Performance Indicators for Consumer & Regional Banking\n \nNine Months Ended\nChange\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount\nPercent\nNet interest income\n$\n3,018 \n$\n3,013 \n$\n5 \n— \n%\nProvision for credit losses\n306 \n227 \n79 \n35 \nNet interest income after provision for credit losses\n2,712 \n2,786 \n(74)\n(3)\nNoninterest income\n1,059 \n968 \n91 \n9 \nNoninterest expense:\nDirect personnel costs\n907 \n847 \n60 \n7 \nOther noninterest expense, including corporate allocations\n1,601 \n1,517 \n84 \n6 \nTotal noninterest expense\n2,508 \n2,364 \n144 \n6 \nIncome before income taxes\n1,263 \n1,390 \n(127)\n(9)\nProvision for income taxes\n265 \n292 \n(27)\n(9)\nNet income attributable to Huntington\n$\n998 \n$\n1,098 \n$\n(100)\n(9)\n%\nNumber of employees (average full-time equivalent)\n11,240 \n11,181 \n59 \n1 \n%\nTotal average assets\n$\n79,149 \n$\n74,245 \n$\n4,904 \n7 \nTotal average loans/leases\n73,176 \n68,438 \n4,738 \n7 \nTotal average deposits\n111,416 \n109,988 \n1,428 \n1 \nNet interest margin\n3.56 \n%\n3.60 \n%\n(0.04)\n%\n(1)\nNCOs\n$\n181 \n$\n154 \n$\n27 \n18 \nNCOs as a % of average loans and leases\n0.33 \n%\n0.30 \n%\n0.03 \n%\n10 \nTotal assets under management (in billions)—eop\n$\n37.0 \n$\n33.2 \n$\n3.8 \n11 \nTotal trust assets (in billions)—eop\n57.5 \n188.0 \n(130.5)\n(69)\nConsumer & Regional Banking reported net income of $998 million in the nine-month period of 2025, a decrease of $100 million, or 9%, compared to the year-ago period.

The provision for credit losses increased $79 million due primarily to higher net charge-offs and loan growth. Noninterest income increased $91 million, or 9%, primarily due to a $24 million gain on the sale of a portion of our trust and custody business, which also resulted in a corresponding decrease in our total trust assets, an increase in wealth and asset management revenue, driven by increases in trust income and management account fees, and an increase in payments and cash management revenue, reflecting an increase in merchant acquiring transaction revenue. Noninterest expense increased $144 million, or 6%, primarily due to the allocation of higher indirect expenses in addition to higher direct personnel costs.\n32\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nCommercial Banking\nTable 24 - Key Performance Indicators for Commercial Banking\n \nNine Months Ended\nChange\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount\nPercent\nNet interest income\n$\n1,564 \n$\n1,579 \n$\n(15)\n(1)\n%\nProvision for credit losses\n34 \n86 \n(52)\n(60)\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses\n1,530 \n1,493 \n37 \n2 \nNoninterest income\n557 \n490 \n67 \n14 \nNoninterest expense:\nDirect personnel costs\n440 \n429 \n11 \n3 \nOther noninterest expense, including corporate allocations\n499 \n454 \n45 \n10 \nTotal noninterest expense\n939 \n883 \n56 \n6 \nIncome before income taxes\n1,148 \n1,100 \n48 \n4 \nProvision for income taxes\n241 \n231 \n10 \n4 \nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest\n14 \n16 \n(2)\n(13)\nNet income attributable to Huntington\n$\n893 \n$\n853 \n$\n40 \n5 \n%\nNumber of employees (average full-time equivalent)\n2,200 \n2,376 \n(176)\n(7)\n%\nTotal average assets\n$\n69,522 \n$\n62,929 \n$\n6,593 \n10 \nTotal average loans/leases\n59,933 \n54,600 \n5,333 \n10 \nTotal average deposits\n44,129 \n37,721 \n6,408 \n17 \nNet interest margin\n3.33 \n%\n3.68 \n%\n(0.35)\n%\n(10)\nNCOs \n$\n46 \n$\n120 \n$\n(74)\n(62)\nNCOs as a % of average loans and leases\n0.10 \n%\n0.29 \n%\n(0.19)\n%\n(66)\nCommercial Banking reported net income of $893 million in the first nine-month period of 2025, an increase of \n$40 million\n, or 5%, compared to the year-ago period.

Assets include investment securities and bank- owned life insurance. \nNet interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios, the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity, and the financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above. Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank-owned life insurance income and securities and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, if any, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 21% tax rate, although our overall effective tax rate is lower.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n33\nTable of Contents\nTable 25 - Key Performance Indicators for Treasury / Other\n \nNine Months Ended\nChange\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmount\nPercent\nNet interest loss\n$\n(183)\n$\n(642)\n$\n459 \n71 \n%\nNoninterest income\n(23)\n23 \n(46)\n(200)\nNoninterest expense:\nDirect personnel costs\n803 \n710 \n93 \n13 \nOther noninterest expense, including corporate allocations\n(655)\n(573)\n(82)\n(14)\nTotal noninterest expense\n148 \n137 \n11 \n8 \nLoss before income taxes\n(354)\n(756)\n402 \n53 \nBenefit for income taxes\n(155)\n(215)\n60 \n28 \nNet loss attributable to Huntington\n$\n(199)\n$\n(541)\n$\n342 \n63 \n%\nNumber of employees (average full-time equivalent)\n6,758 \n6,339 \n419 \n7 \n%\nTotal average assets\n$\n58,901 \n$\n57,221 \n$\n1,680 \n3 \nTreasury / Other reported a net loss of \n$199 million\n in the first nine-month period of 2025, compared to a net loss of $541 million in the year-ago period, driven by improvement in net interest income, partially offset by lower noninterest income and a decrease in the benefit for income taxes.

Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in Table 1 in this report.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n35\nTable of Contents\nFully-Taxable Equivalent Basis\nInterest income, yields, and ratios on an FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on an FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nNon-Regulatory Capital Ratios\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including tangible common equity to tangible assets.\nNon-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures.\nBecause there are no standardized definitions for non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company’s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, we encourage readers to consider the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 - “Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this report including this MD&A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAn accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses and goodwill. The policies, assumptions, and judgments related to goodwill are described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates section within the MD&A of Huntington’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following details the policies, assumption, and judgments related to the allowance for credit losses.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL at September 30, 2025 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default, conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance, and assigned risk ratings. We utilize statistically-based models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of our loan portfolio. As part of our model risk oversight, we perform ongoing monitoring of model performance to assess modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancements, which may result in updates to our statistically based models from time-to-time.\n36\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nOne of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and GDP. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next.\nGiven the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse, and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate.\nTo illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario reflecting an amount of stress in excess of current expectations. This scenario contemplates elevated interest rates weakening credit-sensitive consumer spending and confidence more than expected. In this scenario, the impact of tariffs on the economy is significantly worse than expected, causing inflation to increase. In response, the Federal Reserve raises rates in the fourth quarter of 2025. Increased geopolitical tensions heighten the risk that China might block the Taiwan strait, limiting the supply chain for semiconductors and raising fears of a broader conflict. Additionally, concerns grow that the Russian invasion of Ukraine lasts longer than in the baseline scenario and that the Middle East conflict will widen. The combination of tariffs, rising inflation, political tensions, still elevated interest rates, and reduced credit availability causes the economy to fall into a recession in the fourth quarter of 2025. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate increases significantly from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period. The unemployment rate in this adverse scenario is projected at 6.0% at the end of 2025, and 8.4% at the end of 2026, approximately 160 basis points and 360 basis points higher than the baseline scenario projections of 4.4% at the end of 2025 and 4.8% at the end of 2026, respectively. In addition, GDP is significantly lower in the adverse scenario, with a projected decline of 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and 1.7% for the full year of 2026, respectively, compared to growth of 1.0% and 1.4%, respectively, in the baseline scenario.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at September 30, 2025, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and this 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $0.7 billion at September 30, 2025. \nThe resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following:\n•\nManagement uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process;\n•\nThe highly uncertain economic environment; \n•\nThe difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and\n•\nThe sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework.\nWe regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. Large loan exposures may be addressed through a portfolio heterogeneity reserve. We also consider how significant changes in underwriting policies and procedures could impact the ACL, including consideration of material changes in portfolio growth rates or credit terms. Any changes to management and staffing that could impact lending, collections, or other relevant departments that could increase risk within the allowance process are also contemplated. Observed changes in the quality of the credit review process identified by the second and third line reviews are also given appropriate consideration.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n37\nTable of Contents\nThere is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as geopolitical instability or risks of elevated interest rates for longer including a near-term recession, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the geopolitical instability and risks of elevated interest rates will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity, and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time. For more information, see Note 5 - “Loans and Leases” and Note 6 - “Allowance For Credit Losses” of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments\nNote 2 - “Accounting Standards Update” of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2025 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted, if applicable. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this MD&A and the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n38\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nItem 1: Financial Statements\nHuntington Bancshares Incorporated\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n(Unaudited) \nAt September 30, \nAt December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2025\n2024\nAssets\nCash and due from banks\n$\n1,696\n \n$\n1,685\n \nInterest-earning deposits with banks\n11,536\n \n11,647\n \nTrading account securities\n81\n \n53\n \nAvailable-for-sale securities\n26,085\n \n27,273\n \nHeld-to-maturity securities\n15,597\n \n16,368\n \nOther securities\n870\n \n823\n \nLoans held for sale (includes $\n817\n and $\n652\n, respectively, measured at fair value)\n823\n \n654\n \nLoans and leases (includes $\n171\n and $\n173\n, respectively, measured at fair value)\n137,956\n \n130,042\n \nAllowance for loan and lease losses\n(\n2,374\n)\n(\n2,244\n)\nNet loans and leases (1)\n135,582\n \n127,798\n \nBank-owned life insurance\n2,810\n \n2,793\n \nAccrued income and other receivables\n1,819\n \n2,190\n \nPremises and equipment\n1,112\n \n1,066\n \nGoodwill\n5,547\n \n5,561\n \nServicing rights and other intangible assets\n644\n \n677\n \nOther assets (1)\n6,026\n \n5,642\n \nTotal assets\n$\n210,228\n \n$\n204,230\n \nLiabilities and shareholders’ equity\nLiabilities\nDeposits:\nDemand deposits—noninterest-bearing\n$\n28,596\n \n$\n29,345\n \nInterest-bearing\n136,616\n \n133,103\n \nTotal deposits\n165,212\n \n162,448\n \nShort-term borrowings\n252\n \n199\n \nLong-term debt (1) (includes $\n1,299\n and $\n821\n, respectively, measured at fair value)\n17,315\n \n16,374\n \nOther liabilities (1)\n5,163\n \n5,427\n \nTotal liabilities\n187,942\n \n184,448\n \nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities (Note 16)\nShareholders’ Equity\nPreferred stock\n2,731\n \n1,989\n \nCommon stock\n15\n \n15\n \nCapital surplus\n15,537\n \n15,484\n \nLess treasury shares, at cost\n(\n87\n)\n(\n86\n)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n2,071\n)\n(\n2,866\n)\nRetained earnings\n6,123\n \n5,204\n \nTotal Huntington shareholders’ equity\n22,248\n \n19,740\n \nNon-controlling interest\n38\n \n42\n \nTotal equity\n22,286\n \n19,782\n \nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n210,228\n \n$\n204,230\n \nCommon shares authorized (par value of $\n0.01\n)\n2,250,000,000\n \n2,250,000,000\n \nCommon shares outstanding\n1,459,390,757\n \n1,453,635,809\n \nTreasury shares outstanding\n6,907,525\n \n6,984,102\n \nPreferred stock, authorized shares\n6,617,808\n \n6,617,808\n \nPreferred shares outstanding\n885,000\n \n877,500\n \n(1)\nIncludes VIE balances in net loans and leases, other assets, long-term debt, and other liabilities of $\n769\n million, $\n334\n million, $\n694\n million, and $\n123\n million, respectively, at September 30, 2025, and $\n1.1\n billion, $\n264\n million, $\n1.0\n billion, and $\n109\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024.

accompanying interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Huntington reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial position, the results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented.

There were no other material subsequent events to disclose for the current period.\n2. \nACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE\nAccounting standards adopted\nStandard\nSummary of guidance\nEffects on financial Statements\nASU 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvement to Reportable Segments\n•\nRequires disclosure of the position and title of the CODM and significant segment expenses that the CODM is regularly provided.      \n•\nRequires the disclosure of other segment items representing the difference between segment revenue and expense and the profit and loss measure of the segment.   \n•\nAllows for the CODM to use more than one measure of segment profit and loss, as long as one measure is consistent with GAAP.\n•\nHuntington adopted the standard effective for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the first interim period beginning in 2025. \n•\nThe adoption did not result in a material impact on Huntington’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n•\nThe amendments have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented and segment expense categories are based on the categories identified at adoption. \n•\nRefer to Note 17 - “Segment Reporting” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 24 - “Segment Reporting” of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure information.\nAccounting standards not yet effective\nStandard\nSummary of guidance\nEffects on financial Statements\nASU 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n•\nRequires a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and reporting currency amounts between the reported amount of income tax expense (or benefit) to the amount of statutory federal income tax at current rates for specified categories using specified disaggregation criteria.\n•\nRequires disclosure of the amount of net income taxes paid for federal, state, and foreign taxes, including amounts in each jurisdiction where net taxes paid are equal to or greater than a 5% quantitative threshold. \n•\nRequires disclosure of pre-tax income disaggregated between domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions, as well as income tax expense disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. \n•\nEffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with first disclosure additions to be included in the 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nThe amendments should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted.\n•\nThe adoption is not expected to result in a material impact on Huntington’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n46\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\n3. \nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nVeritex Acquisition\nEffective October 20, 2025, Huntington completed its previously announced merger with Veritex Holdings, Inc. (“Veritex”), a bank holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 13, 2025 (“Merger Agreement”). On October 20, 2025, Veritex merged with and into Huntington, with Huntington as the surviving company, immediately followed by the merger of Veritex’s wholly owned subsidiary bank, Veritex Community Bank, with and into Huntington’s wholly owned subsidiary bank, The Huntington National Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, Huntington issued \n1.95\n shares of its common stock for each outstanding share of Veritex common stock (“Merger Consideration”), with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, each holder of an outstanding Veritex stock option received cash equal to the per-share value of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price, while any Veritex stock option with a per-share exercise price that was equal to or greater than the per share value of the Merger Consideration was cancelled for no consideration, and each outstanding restricted stock unit representing a right to receive Veritex common stock was converted into a restricted stock unit representing a right to receive Huntington’s common stock as adjusted by the \n1.95\n exchange ratio.\nUpon completion of the merger, Huntington issued \n107\n million shares of its common stock to Veritex shareholders of record as of the merger date, in addition to \n1\n million shares issued upon the conversion of certain Veritex equity awards, resulting in total consideration from the transaction of approximately $\n1.7\n billion based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on October 17, 2025. As of September 30, 2025, Veritex had $\n12.8\n billion in assets, including $\n9.6\n billion in loans, and $\n10.8\n billion in deposits. The Merger will be accounted for under ASC 805 as a business combination. Due to the recent closing of the merger, the initial accounting for the business combination, including the purchase price allocation, is incomplete and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nPending Acquisition of Cadence\nOn October 27, 2025, Huntington announced entry into a definitive merger agreement with The Huntington National Bank, Huntington’s wholly owned subsidiary bank, and Cadence Bank (“Cadence”), a regional bank headquartered in Houston, Texas and Tupelo, Mississippi, whereby Cadence will merge with and into The Huntington National Bank, with The Huntington National Bank as the surviving bank. Under the terms of the agreement, Huntington will issue \n2.475\n shares for each outstanding share of Cadence in a 100% stock transaction.

period\n$\n1,638\n \n$\n798\n \n$\n2,436\n \nAt September 30, 2025, the ACL was $\n2.6\n billion, a $\n116\n million increase compared to December 31, 2024. The increase in the ACL was driven by loan and lease growth, partially offset by a modest reduction in overall coverage ratios. The ACL coverage ratio at September 30, 2025 is reflective of the current macroeconomic forecast and changes in various risk profiles intended to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative reserve. \n60\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nThe commercial ACL was $\n1.7\n billion at September 30, 2025, a $\n65\n million increase compared to December 31, 2024, with the increase primarily due to loan growth, partially offset by a modest reduction in overall coverage ratios. The consumer ACL was $\n869\n million at September 30, 2025, a $\n51\n million increase compared to December 31, 2024, with the increase primarily due to loan growth.\nThe baseline economic scenario used in the September 30, 2025 ACL determination assumes continued tariff uncertainty, but reflects marginal improved performance of the U.S. economy in the near term with minimal change in the overall outlook. In this scenario, the unemployment rate is expected to end 2025 at 4.4%, with peak unemployment of 4.8% through the end of 2026. The Federal Reserve restarted rate cuts in the third quarter of 2025 and is expected to continue with future rate cuts until reaching a federal funds rate of 3% by the end of 2026. The inflation outlook deteriorates slightly as the impacts of tariffs and other trade policies are expected to cascade through the economy, with near-term inflation expected to rise further above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target until the rate begins to decline in the second half of 2026 but still remaining above target. GDP growth, while positive, has slowed to a current level of approximately 1% and is forecasted to remain below 2% through the end of 2026.\nThe economic scenarios used included elevated levels of economic uncertainty, such as the impact of specific challenges in the commercial real estate industry, recent inflation levels, the impacts of U.S. trade policies, the U.S. labor market, the expected path of interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve, and the impact of significant conflicts on-going around the world. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the September 30, 2025 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components to address uncertainty not measured within the quantitative transaction reserve.\n \n7. \nMORTGAGE LOAN SALES AND SERVICING RIGHTS \nResidential Mortgage Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes activity relating to residential mortgage loans sold with servicing retained.\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nResidential mortgage loans sold with servicing retained\n$\n1,514\n \n$\n1,150\n \n$\n3,691\n \n$\n2,944\n \nPretax gains resulting from above loan sales (1)\n24\n \n17\n \n66\n \n49\n \nTotal servicing, late, and other ancillary fees (1)\n27\n \n27\n \n80\n \n78\n \n(1)\nIncluded in mortgage banking income.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in MSRs recorded using the fair value method.\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFair value, beginning of period\n$\n567\n \n$\n543\n \n$\n573\n \n$\n515\n \nNew servicing assets created\n27\n \n12\n \n67\n \n33\n \nChange in fair value during the period due to:\nTime decay (1)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n20\n)\n(\n19\n)\nPayoffs (2)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n28\n)\n(\n21\n)\nChanges in valuation inputs or assumptions (3)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n25\n)\n(\n16\n)\n7\n \nFair value, end of period\n$\n576\n \n$\n515\n \n$\n576\n \n$\n515\n \nRelated loans serviced for third parties, unpaid principal balance, end of period\n$\n34,370\n \n$\n33,565\n \n$\n34,370\n \n$\n33,565\n \n(1)\nRepresents decrease in value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled principal payments and partial loan paydowns.\n(2)\nRepresents decrease in value associated with loans that paid off during the period.\n(3)\nRepresents change in value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n61\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes key assumptions and the sensitivity of the MSR value to changes in these assumptions.\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nDecline in fair value due to\nDecline in fair value due to\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nActual\n10%\nadverse\nchange\n20%\nadverse\nchange\nActual\n10%\nadverse\nchange\n20%\nadverse\nchange\nConstant prepayment rate \n(annualized)\n8.51\n \n%\n$\n(\n16\n)\n$\n(\n32\n)\n7.54\n \n%\n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n28\n)\nSpread over forward interest rate swap rates\n566\n \nbps\n(\n14\n)\n(\n27\n)\n568\n \nbps\n(\n13\n)\n(\n26\n)\n8. \nBORROWINGS \nBorrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and were comprised of the following.\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\n$\n144\n \n$\n142\n \nOther borrowings\n108\n \n57\n \nTotal short-term borrowings\n$\n252\n \n$\n199\n \nThe carrying value of assets pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements totaled $\n205\n million and $\n224\n million as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.

Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options, restricted stock units, performance share units, and shares held in deferred compensation plans. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive.\nThe following table shows the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions, except per share data, share count in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nBasic earnings per common share:\nNet income attributable to Huntington\n$\n629\n \n$\n517\n \n$\n1,692\n \n$\n1,410\n \nDividends on preferred shares\n27\n \n36\n \n81\n \n107\n \nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n602\n \n$\n481\n \n$\n1,611\n \n$\n1,303\n \nAverage common shares issued and outstanding\n1,459,129\n \n1,452,682\n \n1,456,979\n \n1,450,794\n \nBasic earnings per common share\n$\n0.41\n \n$\n0.33\n \n$\n1.11\n \n$\n0.90\n \nDiluted earnings per common share:\nAverage dilutive potential common shares:\nStock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units\n18,491\n \n17,061\n \n18,662\n \n16,622\n \nShares held in deferred compensation plans\n6,967\n \n7,239\n \n7,036\n \n7,443\n \nAverage dilutive potential common shares\n25,458\n \n24,300\n \n25,698\n \n24,065\n \nTotal diluted average common shares issued and outstanding\n1,484,587\n \n1,476,982\n \n1,482,677\n \n1,474,859\n \nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.41\n \n$\n0.33\n \n$\n1.09\n \n$\n0.88\n \nAnti-dilutive awards (1)\n230\n \n4,253\n \n1,693\n \n7,002\n \n(1)\nReflects the total number of shares related to outstanding options that have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n67\nTable of Contents\n12. \nREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS \nRevenue is segregated based on the nature of the product and services offered as part of contractual arrangements.

Payment terms and conditions vary amongst services and customers, and thus impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Some fees may be paid before any service is rendered and accordingly, such fees are deferred until the obligations pertaining to those fees are satisfied. Most Huntington contracts with customers are cancelable by either party without penalty or they are short-term in nature, with a contract duration of less than one year. Accordingly, most revenue deferred for the reporting period ended September 30, 2025 is expected to be earned within one year. Huntington does not have significant balances of contract assets or contract liabilities and any change in those balances during the reporting period ended September 30, 2025 was determined to be immaterial.\n13. \nFAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nSee Note 18 - “Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements.

a nonrecurring basis\nCertain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impairment. The gains (losses) represent the amounts recorded during the period regardless of whether the asset is still held at period end.\nThe amounts measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were as follows.\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nTotal Losses\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCollateral-dependent loans\n$\n37\n \n$\n192\n \n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n(\n57\n)\n$\n(\n45\n)\nHuntington records nonrecurring adjustments of collateral-dependent loans held for investment. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of the collateral and incorporate measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties and cost of construction. Periodically, in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, an impairment charge is recognized in the form of a charge-off.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n74\nTable of Contents\nSignificant unobservable inputs for assets and liabilities measured at fair value\nThe following table presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nQuantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (1)\nAt September 30, 2025 \nAt December 31, 2024\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nValuation Technique\nSignificant Unobservable Input\nRange \nWeighted Average\nRange\nWeighted Average\nMeasured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nMSRs\nDiscounted cash flow\nConstant prepayment rate\n7\n \n%\n-\n59\n \n%\n9\n \n%\n6\n \n%\n-\n43\n \n%\n8\n \n%\nSpread over forward interest rate swap rates\n5\n \n%\n-\n10\n \n%\n6\n \n%\n5\n \n%\n-\n10\n \n%\n6\n \n%\nMunicipal securities and asset-backed securities \nDiscounted cash flow\nDiscount rate\n4\n \n%\n-\n4\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n-\n5\n \n%\n5\n \n%\nCumulative default\n—\n \n%\n-\n64\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n-\n39\n \n%\n4\n \n%\nLoss given default (2)\n20\n \n%\n20\n \n%\n(1)     Certain disclosures related to quantitative level 3 fair value measurements do not include those deemed to be immaterial.\n(2)     The range is not meaningful for this unobservable input.\nThe following provides a general description of the impact of a change in an unobservable input on the fair value measurement and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant/significant. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs.\nComponents of credit loss estimates including probability of default, constant default, cumulative default, loss given default, cure given deferral, and loss severity, are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve. An increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa. Higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values. Credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and market volatility improve.\nDiscount rates and spread over forward interest rate swap rates typically increase when market interest rates increase and/or credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market interest rates decline and/or credit and liquidity conditions improve. Higher discount rates and credit spreads generally result in lower fair market values.\nFair values of financial instruments\nMany of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments, expected future cash flows, and appropriate discount rates.\nThe short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include trading account securities, customers’ acceptance liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances outstanding, and cash and short-term assets, which include cash and due from banks and interest-earning deposits with banks. Loan commitments and letters-of-credit generally have short-term, variable-rate features and contain clauses that limit Huntington’s exposure to changes in customer credit quality.

Designating a derivative as an accounting hedge allows Huntington to recognize gains and losses on the hedging instruments in the income statement line item where the gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated in an effective hedge relationship under GAAP immediately impact earnings within the period they occur. \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n77\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the fair values and notional values of all derivative instruments included in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Balance sheet hedging activity is generally arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment that can be classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are executed to hedge changes in fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt and investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Cash flow hedges are executed to modify interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n78\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the gross notional values of derivatives used in Huntington’s asset and liability management activities at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, identified by the underlying interest rate-sensitive instruments.\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nFair Value Hedges\nCash Flow Hedges\nEconomic Hedges\nTotal\nAt September 30, 2025\nInstruments associated with:\nInvestment securities\n$\n5,287\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5,287\n \nLoans\n—\n \n26,250\n \n175\n \n26,425\n \nLong-term debt\n10,599\n \n—\n \n—\n \n10,599\n \nTotal notional value\n$\n15,886\n \n$\n26,250\n \n$\n175\n \n$\n42,311\n \nAt December 31, 2024\nInstruments associated with:\nInvestment securities\n$\n10,987\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n10,987\n \nLoans\n—\n \n23,300\n \n175\n \n23,475\n \nLong-term debt\n11,347\n \n—\n \n—\n \n11,347\n \nTotal notional value\n$\n22,334\n \n$\n23,300\n \n$\n175\n \n$\n45,809\n \nThese derivative financial instruments were entered into for the purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities. Net amounts receivable or payable on contracts hedging either interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either interest income or interest expense. Adjustments to interest income were also recorded for the amounts related to the amortization of premiums for floors that were not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness, as well as the amounts related to terminated hedges reclassified from AOCI. The net amounts resulted in decreases to net interest income of $\n38\n million and $\n57\n million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively, and decreases to net interest income of $\n63\n million and $\n195\n million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe changes in fair value of the fair value hedges are recorded through earnings and offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\nHuntington has designated $\n5.3\n billion of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate investment securities using the portfolio layer method. This approach allows the Company to designate as the hedged item a stated amount of the assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults, or other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows. The fair value portfolio level basis adjustment on our hedged MBS portfolio has not been attributed to the individual AFS securities in our Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the change in fair value for derivatives designated as fair value hedges as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item.\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nInterest rate contracts\nChange in fair value of interest rate swaps hedging investment securities (1)\n$\n(\n40\n)\n$\n(\n295\n)\n$\n(\n302\n)\n$\n(\n263\n)\nChange in fair value of hedged investment securities (1)\n38\n \n293\n \n299\n \n259\n \nChange in fair value of interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt (2)\n16\n \n301\n \n231\n \n142\n \nChange in fair value of hedged long-term debt (2)\n(\n16\n)\n(\n302\n)\n(\n231\n)\n(\n143\n)\n(1)\nRecognized in Interest income—available-for-sale securities—taxable in the \nUnaudited Consolidated Statements of Income\n.\n(2)\nRecognized in Interest expense—long-term debt in the \nUnaudited Consolidated Statements of Income\n.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n79\nTable of Contents\nThe following amounts were recorded on the balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges.\nAmortized Cost\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment To Hedged Items\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nAssets\nAvailable-for-sale securities (1)\n$\n8,478\n \n$\n16,390\n \n$\n(\n160\n)\n$\n(\n458\n)\nLiabilities\nLong-term debt (2)\n11,074\n \n11,589\n \n8\n \n(\n223\n)\n(1)\nAmounts represent the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships under the portfolio layer method. The hedged item is a layer of the closed portfolio that is expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. \n(2)\nExcluded from the above table are the cumulative amount of fair value hedge adjustments remaining for long-term debt for which hedge accounting has been discontinued in the amounts of $(\n46\n) million at September 30, 2025 and $(\n56\n) million at December 31, 2024.\nCash Flow Hedges\nAt September 30, 2025, Huntington had $\n26.3\n billion of interest rate swaps and floors that are designated as cash flow hedges for variable-rate commercial loans. The change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is initially recognized in OCI and is reclassified into income when the hedged item impacts earnings. The initial premium paid for the interest rate floor contracts represents the time value of the contracts and is not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness. The initial premium paid is amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to interest income over the contractual life of these contracts.\nAt September 30, 2025, net losses recognized in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months totaled $\n19\n million.\nDerivatives used in mortgage banking activities\nMortgage loan origination hedging activity\nHuntington uses derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income. Huntington’s mortgage origination hedging activity is related to economically hedging Huntington’s mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. The value of a newly originated mortgage is not firm until the interest rate is committed or locked. Forward commitments to sell economically hedge the possible loss on interest rate lock commitments due to interest rate change. These derivatives were in a net asset position of $\n3\n million at September 30, 2025 and $\n7\n million at December 31, 2024. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $\n1.6\n billion and $\n869\n million, respectively. These contracts mature in less than \none year\n.\nMSR hedging activity\nHuntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its MSRs. These derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts. The derivative instruments used are not designated as qualifying hedges. Accordingly, such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income. Huntington’s MSR economic hedging activity uses securities and derivatives to manage the value of the MSR assets and to mitigate the various types of risk inherent in the MSR assets, including risks related to duration, basis, convexity, volatility, and yield curve. The hedging instruments include forward commitments, TBA securities, Treasury futures contracts, interest rate swaps, and options on interest rate swaps.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n80\nTable of Contents\nMSR hedging trading assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trading gains (losses) are included in mortgage banking income in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income. \nThe notional value of the derivative financial instruments, the corresponding trading assets and liabilities positions, and net trading gains (losses) related to MSR hedging activity are summarized in the following tables.\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nNotional value\n$\n2,350\n \n$\n1,780\n \nTrading liabilities\n15\n \n45\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTrading gains (losses)\n$\n4\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\nDerivatives used in customer-related activities\nVarious derivative financial instruments are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and for their risk-management purposes. Derivative financial instruments used in trading activities consist of commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange contracts. Huntington enters into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies in order to economically hedge significant exposure related to derivatives used in trading activities.\nThe interest rate or price risk of customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value.\nThe net fair values of these derivative financial instruments, for which the gross amounts are included in other assets or other liabilities at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, were $\n64\n million and $\n72\n million, respectively. The total notional values of derivative financial instruments used by Huntington on behalf of customers, including offsetting derivatives, were $\n49.7\n billion and $\n45.2\n billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Huntington’s credit risk from customer derivatives was $\n158\n million and $\n76\n million at the same dates, respectively.\nCredit derivative instruments \nHuntington enters into credit default swaps to hedge credit risk associated with certain loans and leases. These contracts are accounted for as derivatives, and accordingly, these contracts are recorded at fair value. The total notional value of credit contracts was $\n160\n million and $\n247\n million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The position of these derivatives was a net asset of $\n3\n million at September 30, 2025 and $\n2\n million at December 31, 2024.\nFinancial assets and liabilities that are offset in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets\nHuntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in Note 13 - “\nFair Values of Assets and Liabilities\n”.\nDerivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Additionally, collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values. Huntington enters into derivative transactions with \ntwo\n primary groups: 1) broker-dealers and banks and 2) Huntington’s customers. Different methods are utilized for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk for each of these groups.\nHuntington enters into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions generally are high dollar volume. Huntington enters into collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties and routinely exchanges cash and high quality securities collateral.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n81\nTable of Contents\nHuntington also enters into transactions with customers to meet their financing, investing, payment, and risk-management needs. These types of transactions generally are low dollar volume. Huntington enters into master netting agreements with customer counterparties; however, collateral is generally not exchanged with customer counterparties.\nIn addition, Huntington clears certain derivative transactions through a clearinghouse, rather than directly with counterparties. Transactions cleared through a clearinghouse require initial margin collateral and variation margin payments depending on the contracts being in a net asset or liability position.\nIn addition to the customer derivative credit exposure, aggregate credit risk associated with broker-dealer and bank derivative transactions was net credit risk of $\n28\n million and $\n192\n million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The net credit risk associated with derivatives is calculated after considering master netting agreements and is reduced by collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty.\nAt September 30, 2025, Huntington pledged $\n111\n million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties, while other counterparties pledged $\n150\n million of investment securities and cash collateral to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements. In the event of credit downgrades, Huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral.\nThe following tables present the gross amounts of these assets and liabilities with any offsets to arrive at the net amounts recognized in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOffsetting of Financial Assets and Derivative Assets\nGross amounts\noffset in the unaudited\nconsolidated\nbalance sheets\nNet amounts of\nassets\npresented in\nthe unaudited\nconsolidated\nbalance sheets\nGross amounts not offset in the\nunaudited consolidated\nbalance sheets\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nGross amounts of recognized assets\nFinancial instruments\nCash collateral received\nNet amount\nAt September 30, 2025\n$\n502\n \n$\n(\n291\n)\n$\n211\n \n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n25\n)\n$\n184\n \nAt December 31, 2024\n610\n \n(\n344\n)\n266\n \n(\n5\n)\n(\n35\n)\n226\n \nOffsetting of Financial Liabilities and Derivative Liabilities\nGross amounts offset in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets\nNet amounts of liabilities presented in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets\nGross amounts not offset in the\nunaudited consolidated\nbalance sheets\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nGross amounts of recognized liabilities\nFinancial instruments\nCash collateral delivered\nNet amount\nAt September 30, 2025\n$\n508\n \n$\n(\n163\n)\n$\n345\n \n$\n(\n65\n)\n$\n(\n40\n)\n$\n240\n \nAt December 31, 2024\n668\n \n(\n90\n)\n578\n \n(\n67\n)\n(\n316\n)\n195\n \n15. \nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES \nConsolidated VIEs\nHuntington engages in activities with VIEs in the normal course of business that result in Huntington being the primary beneficiary and which are consolidated in Huntington’s financial statements. \nThe following table provides a summary of the assets and liabilities of VIEs carried on Huntington’s Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nAssets\nNet loans and leases\n$\n769\n \n$\n1,122\n \nOther assets\n334\n \n264\n \nTotal assets\n$\n1,103\n \n$\n1,386\n \nLiabilities\nLong-term borrowings\n$\n694\n \n$\n1,023\n \nOther liabilities\n123\n \n109\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n817\n \n$\n1,132\n \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n82\nTable of Contents\nHuntington previously completed a securitization transaction by transferring automobile loans to a SPE which was deemed to be a VIE, with the SPE in turn issuing asset-backed notes. The primary purpose of the VIE in the securitization transaction was to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority. Huntington retained notes and residual interest in the VIE and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In addition, Huntington retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE. The assets of the VIE are restricted to the settlement of the asset-backed securities and other obligations of the VIE. Third-party holders of the asset-backed notes do not have recourse to the general assets of Huntington.\nThe economic performance of the VIE is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The VIE is exposed to credit and prepayment risk, which are managed through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, over-collateralization, excess interest on the loans, and the subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities.\nConsolidated VIEs at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 also included investments in LIHTC operating entities that were syndicated and where we serve as the general partner and manager. As manager of these entities, we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance, as well as an obligation to absorb significant expected losses, of the entities.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nThe following tables provide a summary of the assets and liabilities included in Huntington’s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the maximum exposure to losses, associated with its interests related to unconsolidated VIEs for which Huntington holds an interest in, but is not the primary beneficiary.\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nTotal Assets\nTotal Liabilities\nMaximum Exposure to Loss\nAt September 30, 2025\nAffordable housing tax credit partnerships\n$\n2,469\n \n$\n1,017\n \n$\n2,469\n \nTrust preferred securities\n14\n \n248\n \n—\n \nOther investments\n1,367\n \n180\n \n1,367\n \nTotal\n$\n3,850\n \n$\n1,445\n \n$\n3,836\n \nAt December 31, 2024\nAffordable housing tax credit partnerships\n$\n2,382\n \n$\n1,065\n \n$\n2,382\n \nTrust preferred securities\n14\n \n248\n \n—\n \nOther investments\n1,201\n \n168\n \n1,201\n \nTotal\n$\n3,597\n \n$\n1,481\n \n$\n3,583\n \nAffordable Housing and Other Tax Credit Investments\nHuntington makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity.\nHuntington uses the proportional amortization method to account for a majority of its investments in these entities. These investments are included in other assets. Investments that do not meet the requirements of the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method. Investment losses are included in Other noninterest income in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n83\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the balances of Huntington’s affordable housing tax credit investments and related unfunded commitments.\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nAffordable housing tax credit investments\n$\n3,880\n \n$\n3,628\n \nLess: amortization\n(\n1,411\n)\n(\n1,246\n)\nNet affordable housing tax credit investments\n$\n2,469\n \n$\n2,382\n \nUnfunded commitments\n$\n1,017\n \n$\n1,065\n \nThe following table presents other information relating to Huntington’s affordable housing tax credit investments.\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTax credits and other tax benefits recognized\n$\n86\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n259\n \n$\n230\n \nProportional amortization expense included in provision for income taxes\n68\n \n63\n \n209\n \n189\n \nThe initial investment in affordable housing tax credit investments and subsequent tax credits, benefits, and amortization are included within operating activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTrust-Preferred Securities\nHuntington has certain wholly-owned trusts whose assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses are not included within Huntington’s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. These trusts have been formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust-preferred securities, from which the proceeds are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures, which are reflected in Huntington’s Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as long-term debt. The trust securities are the obligations of the trusts, and as such, are not consolidated within Huntington’s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Investments \nOther investments determined to be VIEs include investments in Small Business Investment Companies, Historic Tax Credit Investments, certain equity method investments, renewable energy financings, and other miscellaneous investments.\n16. \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES \nCommitments to Extend Credit\nIn the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. The contract amounts of these financial agreements were as follows:\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nContract amount representing credit risk\nCommitments to extend credit:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n42,656\n \n$\n37,422\n \nConsumer loan portfolio\n20,909\n \n19,993\n \nCommercial real estate\n2,646\n \n2,089\n \nStandby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds\n802\n \n725\n \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n84\nTable of Contents\nCommitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer’s credit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. Certain commitments to extend credit are secured by collateral, including residential and commercial real estate, inventory, receivables, cash and securities, and other business assets.\nStandby letters-of-credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These conditional commitments are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions and mature within \ntwo years\n. Since the conditions under which Huntington is required to fund these conditional commitments may not materialize, the cash requirements are expected to be less than the total outstanding commitments. The carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these conditional commitments was $\n31\n million and $\n27\n million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nOther Guarantees\nHuntington provides guarantees to certain third-party investors in connection with the sale of syndicated affordable housing tax credits. These guarantees are generally in the form of make-whole provisions that are triggered if the underlying performance of LIHTC properties result in a shortfall to the third-party investors and remain in effect until the final associated tax credits are realized. The maximum amount guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements total approximately $\n281\n million and $\n201\n million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and represents the guaranteed portion in these transactions where the make-whole provisions have not yet expired. As of September 30, 2025, the Company did not expect to be subject to any make-whole provisions under these guarantees.\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters \nIn the ordinary course of business, Huntington is, or may be a defendant in, or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, Huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines, or penalties related to each matter may be.\nHuntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established.\nFor certain matters, Huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In cases in which Huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is $\n0\n to $\n20\n million at September 30, 2025 in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent Huntington’s maximum loss exposure.\n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n85\nTable of Contents\nBased on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Huntington. Further, management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address Huntington’s contingent liabilities. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond Huntington’s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to Huntington’s results of operations for any particular reporting period.\n17. \nSEGMENT REPORTING  \nHuntington’s business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. Huntington reports on \ntwo\n business segments: Consumer & Regional Banking and Commercial Banking. All other items not included within our \ntwo\n business segments are reported within the Treasury / Other function, which primarily includes technology and operations and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. For a description of our business segments, see Note 24 - “Segment Reporting” to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Huntington’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe following tables present certain operating basis financial information for each reportable business segment reconciled to Huntington’s consolidated financial results.\nConsumer & Regional Banking\nCommercial Banking\nTreasury / Other\nHuntington Consolidated\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nThree months ended September 30, 2025\nNet interest income (loss)\n$\n1,061\n \n$\n538\n \n$\n(\n93\n)\n$\n1,506\n \nProvision for credit losses\n121\n \n1\n \n—\n \n122\n \nNet interest income (loss) after provision (benefit) for credit losses\n940\n \n537\n \n(\n93\n)\n1,384\n \nNoninterest income\n393\n \n218\n \n17\n \n628\n \nNoninterest expense:\nDirect personnel costs\n308\n \n152\n \n297\n \n757\n \nOther noninterest expense, including corporate allocations\n541\n \n167\n \n(\n219\n)\n489\n \nTotal noninterest expense\n849\n \n319\n \n78\n \n1,246\n \nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n484\n \n436\n \n(\n154\n)\n766\n \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n102\n \n91\n \n(\n60\n)\n133\n \nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest\n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to Huntington\n$\n382\n \n$\n341\n \n$\n(\n94\n)\n$\n629\n \nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nNet interest income (loss)\n$\n1,050\n \n$\n529\n \n$\n(\n228\n)\n$\n1,351\n \nProvision for credit losses\n105\n \n1\n \n—\n \n106\n \nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses\n945\n \n528\n \n(\n228\n)\n1,245\n \nNoninterest income\n338\n \n181\n \n4\n \n523\n \nNoninterest expense:\nDirect personnel costs\n287\n \n144\n \n253\n \n684\n \nOther noninterest expense, including corporate allocations\n512\n \n145\n \n(\n211\n)\n446\n \nTotal noninterest expense\n799\n \n289\n \n42\n \n1,130\n \nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n484\n \n420\n \n(\n266\n)\n638\n \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n102\n \n88\n \n(\n74\n)\n116\n \nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest\n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to Huntington \n$\n382\n \n$\n327\n \n$\n(\n192\n)\n$\n517\n \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n86\nTable of Contents\nConsumer & Regional Banking\nCommercial Banking\nTreasury / Other\nHuntington Consolidated\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nNine months ended September 30, 2025\nNet interest income (loss)\n$\n3,018\n \n$\n1,564\n \n$\n(\n183\n)\n$\n4,399\n \nProvision for credit losses\n306\n \n34\n \n—\n \n340\n \nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses\n2,712\n \n1,530\n \n(\n183\n)\n4,059\n \nNoninterest income\n1,059\n \n557\n \n(\n23\n)\n1,593\n \nNoninterest expense:\nDirect personnel costs\n907\n \n440\n \n803\n \n2,150\n \nOther noninterest expense, including corporate allocations\n1,601\n \n499\n \n(\n655\n)\n1,445\n \nTotal noninterest expense\n2,508\n \n939\n \n148\n \n3,595\n \nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n1,263\n \n1,148\n \n(\n354\n)\n2,057\n \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n265\n \n241\n \n(\n155\n)\n351\n \nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest\n—\n \n14\n \n—\n \n14\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to Huntington\n$\n998\n \n$\n893\n \n$\n(\n199\n)\n$\n1,692\n \nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nNet interest income (loss)\n$\n3,013\n \n$\n1,579\n \n$\n(\n642\n)\n$\n3,950\n \nProvision for credit losses\n227\n \n86\n \n—\n \n313\n \nNet interest income (loss) after provision for credit losses\n2,786\n \n1,493\n \n(\n642\n)\n3,637\n \nNoninterest income\n968\n \n490\n \n23\n \n1,481\n \nNoninterest expense:\nDirect personnel costs\n847\n \n429\n \n710\n \n1,986\n \nOther noninterest expense, including corporate allocations\n1,517\n \n454\n \n(\n573\n)\n1,398\n \nTotal noninterest expense\n2,364\n \n883\n \n137\n \n3,384\n \nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n1,390\n \n1,100\n \n(\n756\n)\n1,734\n \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n292\n \n231\n \n(\n215\n)\n308\n \nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest\n—\n \n16\n \n—\n \n16\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to Huntington\n$\n1,098\n \n$\n853\n \n$\n(\n541\n)\n$\n1,410\n \nAssets\nDeposits\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nConsumer & Regional Banking\n$\n81,412\n \n$\n78,841\n \n$\n110,043\n \n$\n111,390\n \nCommercial Banking\n71,937\n \n66,919\n \n47,651\n \n43,366\n \nTreasury / Other\n56,879\n \n58,470\n \n7,518\n \n7,692\n \nTotal\n$\n210,228\n \n$\n204,230\n \n$\n165,212\n \n$\n162,448\n \n2025 3Q Form 10-Q     \n87\nTable of Contents"
