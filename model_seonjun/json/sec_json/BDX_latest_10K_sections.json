The fair value of consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition was $3.914 billion. Since the acquisition date, financial results for Advanced Patient Monitoring’s product offerings are being reported as a separate organizational unit within the Medical segment. BD funded the transaction with cash on hand, using net proceeds raised through debt issuances in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, as further discussed in Note 16, and borrowings under our commercial paper program. Additional information regarding this acquisition is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nDivestitures\nProposed Combination of Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions Business with Waters Corporation\n On July 13, 2025, BD entered into a definitive agreement to combine its Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters Corporation (“Waters”) in a Reverse Morris Trust (“RMT”) transaction. When the RMT transaction is complete, BD’s Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions businesses will be spun-off to BD shareholders and simultaneously merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of Waters.  BD’s shareholders are expected to own approximately 39.2% of the combined company, and existing Waters’ shareholders are expected to own approximately 60.8% of the combined company. In connection with the transaction, BD expects to receive a cash distribution of approximately $4 billion prior to completion of the combination, subject to adjustment for cash, working capital, and indebtedness. The transaction is expected to be generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes to BD and BD’s shareholders and Waters is expected to assume approximately $4 billion of incremental debt. The transaction is expected to close around the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2026, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals, Waters shareholder approval, compliance with applicable U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements, the receipt of a\nprivate letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding certain matters germane to the U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of the transactions and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nSurgical Instrumentation Platform\nIn August 2023, BD completed the sale of the Interventional segment’s Surgical Instrumentation platform pursuant to a definitive agreement that was signed in June 2023. BD recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $268 million, which was recorded as a component of \nOther operating expense (income), net\n in fiscal year 2023. The historical financial results for the Surgical Instrumentation platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation. Additional information regarding this divestiture is contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nSpin-Off of Diabetes Care\nOn April 1, 2022, BD completed the separation and distribution of Embecta Corp. (“Embecta”), formerly BD's Diabetes Care business, into a separate, publicly-traded company. The historical results of the Diabetes Care business (previously included in BD’s Medical segment), as well as interest expense related to indebtedness incurred by Embecta prior to the spin-off date, have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the spin-off date of April 1, 2022. Additional disclosures regarding our spin-off of the Diabetes Care business are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n4\nTable of Contents\nInternational Operations\nBD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. For reporting purposes, we organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, China, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Geographic information with respect to BD’s operations is included under the heading “Geographic Information” in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFor the most part, foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues. BD believes its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein. See further discussion of these risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nDistribution\nBD’s products are marketed and distributed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels, as well as directly to hospitals and other healthcare related institutions by BD and independent sales representatives. In the United States, BD uses acute care, non-acute care, laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers, while our capital equipment is mostly sold direct to our end user customers. In international markets, BD’s products are distributed either directly or through distributors, with the practice varying by country. BD’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal, with the exception of certain medical devices in the Medication Delivery Solutions business unit, and flu diagnostic products in the Diagnostic Solutions business unit, both of which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza. BD operates consolidated distribution facilities globally in order to better service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels. \nRaw Materials and Components\nBD purchases many different types of raw materials and components, including plastics, glass, metals, textiles, paper products, agricultural products, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and various biological, chemical and petrochemical products. BD seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing. However, there are situations where raw materials and components may only be obtained from one supplier, which are referred to as sole sourced. The use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary and/or patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product. In other cases, while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers, only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance, cost or other considerations. To provide alternate sources, BD must complete a rigorous qualification process, which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval. If clinical trials are not required, this qualification process can take 3-18 months depending on the criticality of the change. When clinical trials are required, this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years. BD continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers. BD’s continuity plans may include, but are not limited to, securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers, qualifying alternate manufacturing facilities, maintaining contingency stock, internally developing supply and establishing technology escrow accounts. While BD works closely with its suppliers, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful, and there may be events that cause supply interruption, reduction or termination that adversely impact BD’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products. See further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n5\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nBD conducts its research and development (“R&D”) activities at its operating units and across global enterprise centers of excellence located in the United States, India, China, Singapore and Ireland. The majority of BD’s R&D activities are conducted in North America. Outside North America, BD has a significant R&D presence in Greater Asia and Europe. BD also collaborates with certain universities, medical centers and other entities on R&D programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields.\nIntellectual Property and Licenses\nBD owns significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries. BD is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks owned by others. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to BD’s business. BD believes, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to BD’s business as a whole, or to any business segment.\nCompetition\nBD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous, and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market. Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field. Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets, and some have greater financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the field, particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics, non-traditional point of care and at-home testing, safety-engineered devices and in the life sciences. Additionally, established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area. Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well. Acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment. In addition, the entry into the market of low-cost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures. BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors, including price, quality, innovation, service, reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these factors on BD’s competitive position varies among BD’s various product offerings. In order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates and to boost supply reliability and productivity, BD continues to make investments in R&D, quality management, quality improvement, product innovation, manufacturing and supply chain. See further discussion of the risks relating to competition in the medical technology industry in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nMarket Access and Third-Party Reimbursement\nBD’s customers and their patients rely on public and private payers to reimburse some or all the cost of procedures, products and services. BD actively engages with the payer community, medical societies and other stakeholders in order to navigate market access trends and appropriately communicate value propositions for a broad range of BD medical technologies. However, BD has no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for BD products. \nThe manner and level of reimbursement is determined at the payer’s discretion and may depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to site of care, procedure(s) performed, patient diagnosis, the device(s) and/or drug(s) utilized, available budget, health equity, beneficiary access or a combination of these factors. The providers that we serve are also evaluating changes in the healthcare reimbursement landscape and coverage elements leading to their own decision-making on what they will ultimately pay for various medical technologies or procedures, which could positively or negatively impact sales of BD products in any given country for any given product at any given time.\n6\nTable of Contents\nVertical integration of health systems has created a concentrated market among commercial payers in the U.S. and there is an increased focus globally on payment policies that serve to control healthcare spending while also rewarding quality and patient outcomes. Governments around the world continue to consider and transition to value-based payment reforms that would drive improved value and quality- and resource-based reimbursement. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’(“CMS”) established a 2030 goal of transitioning all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to a “care relationship” to ensure the agency’s accountability of quality and cost of care. Whether these changes are driven by legislative efforts, strategic alliances or market conditions, the global landscape continues to enhance cost control efforts through “pay for performance” mechanisms and bidding and tender policies that focus on quality and performance. \nExamining reimbursement and continually assessing the broader healthcare funding landscape is a strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical technology. Advancing coding, coverage and payment strategies reduce barriers to adoption, improve affordability and are critical to ensuring patient and provider access to medical technologies. Market access strategies are also critical in ensuring commercial priorities are meeting the demand for critical healthcare needs globally and locally.\nRegulation\nGeneral\nBD's operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), export control, transportation, product safety and efficacy, employment, labor, privacy and data protection, customs, exports, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and other areas. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years. This is part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the United States.\nBD’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of BD’s medical products. The scope of the activities of these agencies, particularly in the Europe, Japan, Latin America and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates, has been increasing.\nIn order to market or sell most of its products, BD must secure authorization from the FDA and counterpart foreign regulatory agencies. After a device has received 510(k) clearance, premarket (PMA) approval or other marketing authorization for a specific intended use, certain changes, such as a significant change or changes in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new marketing authorization. The determination as to whether or not a modification or series of modifications require a new marketing authorization is initially left to the manufacturer to assess using available guidance; however, regulators may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until a new marketing authorization is obtained.\nBD actively maintains quality systems that establish standards for its product design, manufacturing, and distribution processes, in accordance with International Organization for Standardization standards and FDA regulations. Regulatory agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of BD’s quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in agency policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new and existing products. Where possible, BD anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes. These agencies have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against BD, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions, for violations of applicable requirements. BD also undertakes voluntary compliance actions, such as voluntary recalls. In some cases, BD may determine that an identified product issue does not require a voluntary recall \n7\nTable of Contents\naction. Should a regulator disagree with such a determination, the regulator may require BD to cease marketing of and recall the device until the issue has been corrected. In addition, BD may be required to seek an additional marketing authorization prior to marketing the corrected device.\nIn addition, the federal government has enacted the Sunshine Act provisions requiring BD to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Countries outside the United States have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed in those countries. Failure to comply with these laws could result in a range of fines, penalties and/or other sanctions.\nConsent Decree with FDA\nOur U.S. infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree originally entered into by Cardinal Health 303, Inc. with the FDA in 2007 related to its Alaris\nTM\n infusion pumps. In 2009, the decree was amended (the “Consent Decree”) to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303, Inc., which was acquired by BD in 2015. CareFusion 303, Inc. remains the manufacturer of BD Alaris\nTM\n infusion pumps. The Consent Decree is specific to infusion pumps and does not apply to intravenous administration sets, accessories, or other products.\nFollowing an inspection that began in March 2020 of our Medication Management Systems’ Infusion quality management system operating out of the site in San Diego, California (CareFusion 303, Inc.), the FDA issued a Form 483 Notice (the “2020 Form 483 Notice”) that contained a number of observations regarding the quality system’s compliance with FDA’s Quality System, reporting of corrections and removals, and Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulations. In December 2021, the FDA issued to CareFusion 303, Inc. a letter of non-compliance with respect to the Consent Decree (the “Non-Compliance Letter”) stating that, among other things, it had determined that certain of the corrective actions to address the 2020 Form 483 Notice appeared to be adequate, some were still in progress such that adequacy could not be determined yet, and certain others were not adequate (e.g., complaint handling and corrective and preventive actions, design verification and medical device reporting). Per the terms of the Non-Compliance Letter, CareFusion 303, Inc. provided the FDA with a proposed comprehensive corrective action plan (“CAP”) and has retained an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of the quality management system operating at the CareFusion 303, Inc. infusion pump facilities through 2025. CareFusion 303, Inc. has and will continue to update its CAP to address any observations that may arise during the course of these audits. \nIn addition, CareFusion 303, Inc. received an additional Form 483 Notice in May 2024 following an FDA inspection (“2024 Form 483 Notice”) that contained observations related to the site’s compliance with the FDA’s quality system regulation (“QSR”) for its Infusion quality management system (covered by the Consent Decree) and QSR and MDR regulation for its separate Dispensing quality management system (which is not subject of the Consent Decree). On November 22, 2024, BD received a Warning Letter from the FDA, which is limited to CareFusion 303, Inc.’s Dispensing quality management system and BD Pyxis\nTM\n products (“Dispensing Warning Letter”). See “— FDA Warning Letters” below for further information. \nThe FDA’s review of our responses to the observations specific to the Infusion quality management system in the 2024 Form 483 Notice and the CAP is ongoing, and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of the observations, including but not limited to action pursuant to the Consent Decree, or that corrective actions proposed by CareFusion 303, Inc. will be adequate to address these observations. Additionally, we cannot currently predict the amount of additional monetary investment that will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business.\nThe Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps, recall products and take other actions. We may be required to pay damages of $15,000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree, up to $15 million per year.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because, among other things, the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the Consent Decree and Non-Compliance Letter and therefore impose penalties under the Consent Decree, and/or we may also be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the Consent Decree, including, but not limited to, additional fines, penalties, other monetary remedies, and expansion of the terms of the Consent Decree. As of September 30, 2025, we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the Consent Decree, and accordingly, we have no accruals associated with compliance with the Consent Decree. \nAs previously disclosed, on July 21, 2023, BD received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its updated BD Alaris™ Infusion System, which enabled both remediation and a return to market for the BD Alaris™ Infusion System. This clearance covers updated hardware features for Point-of-Care Unit (“PCU”), large volume pumps, syringe pumps, patient-controlled analgesia (“PCA”) pumps, respiratory monitoring and auto-identification modules. It also covers a new BD Alaris™ Infusion System software version with enhanced cybersecurity, along with interoperability features that enable smart, connected care with electronic medical record systems. To address open recalls and ensure devices at customer sites are running a recent, cleared version of the BD Alaris™ Infusion System Software, BD Alaris™ Infusion System devices in the U.S. market are being remediated or replaced with the updated 510(k) cleared version, which we expect to be substantially complete over the next calendar year. Additionally, on April 25, 2025, BD received 510(k) clearance from the FDA on an updated BD Alaris™ Infusion System.\nFDA Warning Letters\nOn January 11, 2018, BD received a Warning Letter from the FDA with respect to our former BD Preanalytical Systems (\"PAS\") unit, citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law. BD has worked closely with the FDA and implemented corrective actions to address the quality management system concerns identified in the Warning Letter. In March 2020, the FDA conducted a subsequent inspection of PAS which it classified as Voluntary Action Indicated, which means the FDA will not take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action as a result of the unit’s response to the observations associated with the quality management concerns in the inspection. Additionally, in December 2022, the FDA conducted a subsequent inspection of PAS (now Specimen Management) with no observations. We continue to work with the FDA to generate additional clinical evidence and file 510(k)s as remaining commitments associated with the Warning Letter. As of September 30, 2025, we have received eight FDA clearances.\n \nThe FDA review of these remaining commitments is ongoing, and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of these commitments, including but not limited to action pursuant to the Warning Letter.\nAs noted above, on November 22, 2024, BD received the Dispensing Warning Letter following an inspection of its Dispensing quality management system at its facility located in San Diego, California, citing certain alleged violations of the quality system regulations, MDR regulation, the corrections and removals reporting regulation and law.\n \nBD submitted a comprehensive response to address FDA’s feedback in the Dispensing Warning Letter, which committed to implementing additional corrective actions; however, no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of FDA’s Dispensing Warning Letter, or that corrective actions proposed and taken by CareFusion 303, Inc. will be adequate to address the Dispensing Warning Letter. Any failure to adequately address the Dispensing Warning Letter may result in regulatory actions initiated by the FDA without further notice, which may include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction and civil monetary penalties.  As a result, the ultimate resolution of the Dispensing Warning Letter and its impact on the Company’s operations is unknown at this time.  In connection with the Dispensing Warning Letter, the Company recorded a liability for estimated future costs associated with certain actions required to respond to the Warning Letter and to address the non-conformities. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” It is possible that the amount of the Company’s liability could exceed its currently accrued amount.\n9\nTable of Contents\nEthylene Oxide/Sterilization\nThere is increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and state environmental regulatory agencies. Additional regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide may be imposed in the future, either domestically or outside the United States. Ethylene oxide is the most frequently used sterilant for medical devices and healthcare products in the United States, and in certain cases is the only option to sterilize critical medical device products for the safe administration to patients. Any such increased regulation could require BD or sterilization service providers, including providers used by BD, to temporarily suspend operations to install additional emissions control technology, limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions, which would impact BD’s operations and further reduce the available capacity to sterilize medical devices and healthcare products, and could also result in additional costs. To this end, BD has proactively installed fugitive emissions controls at our facilities in East Columbus, NE and Sandy, UT. On April 5, 2024, the final National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”): Ethylene Oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities regulation issued by the EPA became effective. Companies generally have two years from the effective date to comply with the new requirements of the revised NESHAP. On July 17, 2025, the White House issued a Presidential Proclamation under the Clean Air Act exempting certain sterilization facilities for two years from compliance with the EPA’s revised NESHAP for ethylene oxide emissions from sterilization facilities to allow these facilities more time to obtain and install new control technology and implement other changes to ensure compliance with the revised NESHAP. While BD’s ethylene oxide sterilization facilities received this Presidential compliance exemption we continue to implement certain changes to our facilities in accordance with the revised NESHAP’s requirements, and such measures will require additional implementation and ongoing operational costs, including investments in certain new technologies. \nIn addition, on January 14, 2025, the EPA published a Notice of Availability for a Pesticide Registration Review; Interim Registration Review Decision for Ethylene Oxide (“ID”), which regulates the use of ethylene oxide as a sterilant and is intended to mitigate any human health and environmental risks associated with its use. We are evaluating the requirements of the ID to understand what changes may need to be implemented to comply with the revised pesticide use requirements for ethylene oxide at our sterilization facilities and at the third-party sterilization facilities we utilize. Certain requirements of the ID will become effective as of January 2026 while others will become effective over the next several years.\nIf any new or existing regulatory requirements or rulemaking result in the suspension, curtailment or interruption of sterilization operations at BD or at medical device sterilizers used by BD, or otherwise limit the availability of third-party sterilization capacity, this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products or lead to civil litigation or other claims against BD. BD has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruptions, although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact, for the reasons noted above.\nFor further discussion of risks relating to the regulations to which we are subject, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nHuman Capital Management\nAt BD, our success depends upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain a talented, skilled and high-performing workforce with diverse backgrounds and experiences at all levels across our organization, worldwide, in the highly competitive medical technology industry. Our related human capital strategy is guided by our purpose of \nadvancing the world of health\nTM\n, and THE BD WAY, our cultural foundation that encompasses our core values, leadership expectations and the mindset we bring to our work. Our ability to execute this strategy depends upon several factors, including associate growth and development, compensation and benefits, and fostering a culture of inclusion. We strive to continually invest in our associates with the goal of being an employer of choice for our approximately 72,000 associates located in 61 countries (as of September 30, 2025).\n10\nTable of Contents\nAssociate Growth and Development\nWe are committed to empowering associates to drive their performance and shape their development within a culture grounded in excellence through performance management, talent development and education. Our performance management approach emphasizes clear goals, continuous learning, timely feedback and disciplined execution with the goal of driving accountability and delivering meaningful results. This approach helps to ensure that associates are supported with the tools, coaching and learning experiences needed to elevate performance and realize their potential. In 2025, we reintroduced performance ratings and calibration to strengthen a culture of performance differentiation and help ensure that rewards align with individual associate impact and contributions to our overall strategic objectives.\nWe invest intentionally in developing our talent with the capabilities needed to advance our strategy and serve our customers and patients. We believe our annual Strategic Organizational Planning process enables us to identify and address the capabilities necessary to advance our strategic goals and talent gaps across our enterprise, and in turn, helps ensure that our workforce is equipped to meet evolving business needs, deliver on long-term strategic priorities.\nOnce identified, we rely on internal education efforts to activate these capabilities and embed them across our enterprise. For example, all associates have access to BD University (“BDU”), our internal learning curriculum that builds core and management capabilities in a range of formats to support learning at scale. To accelerate leadership readiness, BDU also offers targeted, nomination-based programs, delivered in partnership with external experts, designed to develop high-potential leaders and help strengthen our succession planning efforts.\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being\nOur total rewards program is designed to attract and retain top talent and to incentivize performance aligned with our business strategy and values. We offer a comprehensive total rewards program aimed at promoting overall well-being in support of the varying health, home-life and financial needs of our global associates. Through our integrated global approach to well-being, we provide support, education and resources to help empower associates across all levels and geographies to prioritize their well-being and build resilience in the physical, emotional, financial and social areas of life. To enable associates to take action in support of their overall well-being, our total rewards packages (which vary by level and location) include market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare benefits and retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, flexible work schedules, on-site health and fitness centers, free physicals and flu vaccinations, well-being education and resources, employee assistance programs and other mental health support and resources. We periodically review and implement program enhancements and investments to help ensure that our benefits are representative of the needs of BD associates and their families. Additionally, over the last several years in the U.S., we have increased efforts to mitigate the impact of rising healthcare costs and offer more cost-effective benefit options, with a specific focus on affordability for BD associates earning $55,000 per year or less.\nWe are also committed to compensating all associates fairly and equitably for their contributions to our performance and as part of this commitment, we periodically conduct comprehensive audits, internal and external analyses, salary benchmarking and assessments to identify and remedy compensation disparities.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCulture of Inclusion and Philanthropy\nWe believe our commitment to an inclusive workforce, coupled with our purpose and culture, allows us to better understand patient and customer needs and develop innovative technologies to meet those needs.  We take pride in building teams with diverse expertise and a deep understanding of the needs of varying populations to best serve our customers and patients worldwide. Our associates possess a broad range of beliefs and experiences that have helped us achieve a leading position in the medical technology industry and the overall global marketplace.\nSeparately, we offer meaningful volunteer opportunities, enabling associates to apply and teach their specific skill sets and capabilities to help strengthen health systems in low-resource settings. Associates are also generally empowered to serve causes that are important to them, including through paid time off, a matching gift program and grants earned for nonprofits in honor of associates who engage in exceptional volunteer efforts. \nIn addition, executive leaders serve as sponsors to our nine Associate Resource Groups (“ARGs”). Each ARG has strategic goals aligned with their respective missions, centered around efforts to advance company goals, connect with local communities and support associates with growing their careers. \nIn 2025, BD was named one of America’s Most Innovative Companies by \nFortune\n, among the World’s Best Companies by \nTIME\n and World’s Best Employers by \nForbes\n. We received the Business Group on Health “Best Employers: Excellence in Health & Well-being Award” for our commitment to advancing employee well-being and, were recognized once again as a best place to work for disability inclusion. In addition, BD was named among the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL, ranking among the top three in the healthcare equipment and services industry.

Within the tables presented throughout this discussion, certain columns may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. References to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which end on September 30.\nCompany Overview\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nBecton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. The Company's organizational structure is based upon three principal business segments, BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Life Sciences (“Life Sciences”) and BD Interventional (“Interventional”).\nBD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. We organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include the following geographic regions: Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (collectively referred to below as “EMA”), as well as, Latin America and certain countries within Greater Asia. \nAs further discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, effective October 1, 2025, we reorganized our organizational units into five distinct, separately-managed segments, based on the nature of our product and service offerings. BD’s new organizational structure is based upon the following five segments: Medical Essentials, Connected Care, BioPharma Systems, Interventional and Life Sciences, which remains a critical part of BD until the separation and combination of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters Corporation (“Waters”) is completed. Additional disclosures regarding the agreement to combine our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters are provided in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nStrategic Objectives\nBD remains focused on delivering durable growth, creating shareholder value and making appropriate investments for the future. Our strategy is anchored in three key pillars: grow, simplify and empower. BD's management team aligns our operating model and investments with these key strategic pillars through continuous focus on the following underlying objectives:\nGrow\n•\nAccelerating innovation in smart devices, robotics, analytics, and artificial intelligence in order to enable new care settings, improve outcomes, streamline care workflows, and reduce costs within healthcare settings;\n•\nFocusing on a strong portfolio of core leading products, solutions and services that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers;\n•\nInvesting in research and development that leads to and expands category leadership, as well as results in a robust product pipeline;\n•\nLeveraging our global scale in order to provide equitable access to affordable medical technologies around the world, including in under-resourced markets;\n35\nTable of Contents\n•\nSupplementing our internal growth through strategic acquisitions in faster growing market segments; and\n•\nFocusing on cash management and an efficient capital structure in order to drive balance sheet productivity and strong shareholder returns.\nSimplify\n•\nDriving operating effectiveness and margin expansion through deployment of our BD Excellence program to increase factory productivity and asset efficiencies;\n•\nReducing complexity, increasing agility and improving customer experience by rationalizing our product portfolio, as well as by simplifying and optimizing our architecture and operating model;\n•\nMaking strategic investments that prioritize a culture of quality and our quality management system to ensure we are a best-in-class, proactive quality-driven organization;\n•\nEnhancing customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes and go-to-market approaches;\n•\nCollaborating across our supply chain to responsibly source materials and goods, as well as to reduce environmental impacts; and\n•\nContinuing our investments in an enterprise-wide renewable energy strategy to create more resilient operations.\nEmpower\n•\nFostering a purpose-driven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders–customers, patients, employees, shareholders and communities;\n•\nCultivating an inclusive work environment that welcomes and celebrates diverse backgrounds and perspectives;\n•\nGrowing and enabling talent through training, development and reskilling strategies; and\n•\nDriving sustainability initiatives within our organizational units to support enterprise-wide collaboration towards our sustainability strategy.\nIn assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as BD’s financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews forecast data, monthly actual results, including segment sales, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows.\nProposed Combination of Our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions Business with Waters\nAs noted above and as further discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we entered into a definitive agreement on July 13, 2025 to combine our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters in a transaction that is expected to create an innovative life science and diagnostics leader with pioneering technologies. \n36\nTable of Contents\nAcquisition of Edwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care Product Group\nOn September 3, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Edwards Lifesciences’ Critical Care product group, which we renamed as BD Advanced Patient Monitoring (“Advanced Patient Monitoring”), for total consideration of $3.914 billion. Advanced Patient Monitoring is a global leader in advanced monitoring solutions that expands BD’s portfolio of smart connected care solutions with its growing set of leading monitoring technologies, advanced AI-enabled clinical decision tools and robust innovation pipeline that complement our existing technologies serving operating rooms and intensive care units. \nBD reports the results associated with Advanced Patient Monitoring’s product offerings as a separate organizational unit within our Medical segment and additional disclosures relating to this acquisition are provided in Notes 11 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nBD’s Divestitures\nIn August 2023, we completed the sale of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform. The historical financial results for this platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation. \nIn April 2022, we completed the separation and distribution of Embecta Corp., formerly BD's Diabetes Care business, into a separate, publicly-traded company. Historical financial results have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.\nAdditional disclosures regarding the sale and separation are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nKey Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Results of Operations\nOur operations, supply chain, suppliers and customers are exposed to various global macroeconomic factors and other risks which we continually evaluate to assess their potential impact to our operations and financial results. \nWe have been experiencing, and may continue to experience, some adverse impact to our results of operations due to market dynamics in China, such as volume-based procurement programs (“VoBP”) and the government’s focus to improve compliance of healthcare practitioners. Also, reductions or delays in governmental research funding has caused customers for certain of our instruments to delay or forgo purchases of these products. Lower demand for vaccines has also adversely impacted our results of operations. The future demand for our products and services could be impacted by other factors including higher interest rates and the deterioration of healthcare systems’ budgets.\nAdditionally, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, temporary shortages in supply of certain materials or components that are used in our products. The stable flow of global transport is critical to our operations and as such, events affecting the flow of logistics around the globe may adversely impact our supply chain and distribution channels. In general, major disruptions in the sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products could adversely impact our results of operations. Also, tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers imposed by the United States, or against the United States from countries in which we do business, could adversely impact our supply chain costs, results of operations and our financial condition. Based upon the latest published tariffs that are currently in effect, we expect tariffs to adversely impact our operating expense for fiscal year 2026 and potentially beyond, primarily relating to any products (or components) imported from countries across our global supply chain which have no exemption opportunities. We continue to monitor international trade policy-related developments to assess their potential impacts to our operations. The ultimate impact of any existing or new tariffs or other changes in international trade policies is subject to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the duration of such tariffs, changes in tariff rates, the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs, any countermeasures that target countries may take, or any mitigating actions that may become available. While sourcing optimization and tariff exemptions for qualifying products are key \n37\nTable of Contents\naspects of our mitigation strategy, the timing of such or the ultimate results we will realize from these efforts are uncertain. In addition, our tariff mitigation strategies may be challenged, rejected or eliminated through legislation or other challenges, or may otherwise not be effective.\nWe continue to invest in research and development, strategic tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including strategic geographical expansion), and develop innovative new products, as well as continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness.\nFor additional information on risk factors that may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSummary of Financial Results\nWorldwide revenues in 2025 of $21.840 billion increased 8.2% from the prior-year period. This increase reflected the following impacts:\nIncrease (decrease) in current-year revenues\nVolume/other (a)\n3.2 \n%\nPricing\n(0.3)\n%\nForeign currency impact\n0.1 \n%\nAcquisition of Advanced Patient Monitoring\n4.8 \n%\nOther (b)\n0.4 \n%\nIncrease in revenues from the prior-year period\n8.2 \n%\n \n(a)    Volume/other includes revenues attributable to products, services and licensing.\n(b)    Represents the impact of accruals recognized in fiscal year 2024 relating to the Italian government medical device pay back legislation, as well as another legal matter, and which substantially relate to years prior to fiscal year 2024. Additional disclosures regarding these legislative and legal matters are provided in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCash flows from continuing operating activities were $3.430 billion in 2025. At September 30, 2025, we had $859 million in cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash. We continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and during fiscal year 2025, we paid cash dividends to common shareholders of $1.196 billion.We also repurchased approximately $1 billion of our common stock during fiscal year 2025.\nEach reporting period and given our worldwide operations, we face exposure to our results of operations from changes in foreign currencies. We calculate translational foreign currency impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results, which allows us to compare results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The fiscal year 2025 impact of foreign currency on our revenues, which is primarily translational, is provided above. The translational impact on our earnings is provided further below. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis, excluding translational foreign currency impacts, in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. We use results on a foreign currency-neutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting \n38\nTable of Contents\nprinciples (“GAAP”). Results on a foreign currency-neutral basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nMedical Segment\nThe following summarizes Medical revenues by organizational unit:\n \n \n \n \n2025 vs. 2024\n2024 vs. 2023\n(Millions of dollars)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nTotal\nChange\nEstimated\nFX\nImpact\nFXN Change\nTotal\nChange\nEstimated\nFX\nImpact\nFXN Change\nMedication Delivery Solutions\n$\n4,575 \n$\n4,429 \n$\n4,293 \n3.3 \n%\n(0.2)\n%\n3.5 \n%\n3.2 \n%\n(0.1)\n%\n3.3 \n%\nMedication Management Solutions\n3,474 \n3,297 \n2,980 \n5.4 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n5.2 \n%\n10.7 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n10.5 \n%\nPharmaceutical Systems\n2,324 \n2,273 \n2,229 \n2.2 \n%\n0.6 \n%\n1.6 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n1.8 \n%\nAdvanced Patient Monitoring\n1,082 \n74 \n— \nNM\nNM\nNM\nNM\nNM\nNM\nTotal Medical revenues\n$\n11,456 \n$\n10,074 \n$\n9,502 \n13.7 \n%\n0.1 \n%\n13.6 \n%\n6.0 \n%\n— \n%\n6.0 \n%\n\"NM\" denotes that the percentage change is not meaningful. \nThe Medical segment’s revenue growth in 2025 primarily reflected the following.\n•\nVolume growth attributable to the Medication Delivery Solutions unit’s Vascular Access Management portfolio and hypodermic products, partially offset by an expected VoBP impact in China.\n•\nGrowth in the Medication Management Solutions unit driven by continued strength in sales of infusion systems, partially offset by the timing of dispensing and pharmacy automation installations, based upon customer readiness, in the current year.\n•\nGrowth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit due to high single-digit growth of prefillable solutions in the biologic drug category, partially offset by lower market demand for other product categories.\n•\nOverall Medical segment revenue growth also reflected sales in the Advanced Patient Monitoring unit, which we acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. \nThe Medical segment’s revenue growth in 2024 primarily reflected the following.\n•\nStrong global demand for the Medication Delivery Solutions unit’s Vascular Access Management portfolio, as well as strong U.S. demand for medication delivery products, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable market dynamics in China.\n•\nDouble-digit growth in sales of infusion systems, as well as higher utilization of infusion sets within the Medication Management Solutions unit, partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to stronger placements of dispensing solutions in 2023.\n•\nDouble-digit growth in sales of the Pharmaceutical Systems unit’s prefillable solutions in the biologic drug category, partially offset by customer order patterns relating to other drug categories.\n•\nOverall Medical segment revenue growth in 2024 also reflected the acquired Advanced Patient Monitoring unit’s sales beginning on September 3, 2024. \n39\nTable of Contents\nMedical segment operating income was as follows:\n(Millions of dollars)\n2025\n2024 (a)\n2023 (a)\nMedical segment operating income\n$\n4,140 \n$\n3,583 \n$\n3,352 \nSegment operating income as % of Medical revenues\n36.1 \n%\n35.6 \n%\n35.3 \n%\n(a)     Prior-period segment income amounts have been recast to conform to the current year presentation, as further discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8.

The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments are provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nBD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. We have also hedged the currency exposure associated with investments in certain foreign subsidiaries with instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts. In order to mitigate transactional foreign currency exposures resulting from anticipated intercompany purchases and sales, we have hedged a portion of this currency risk with certain instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against these foreign currency impacts in fiscal year 2025 or 2024.\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities.\nWith respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2025 and 2024, the impact that changes in the U.S. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows:\n \nIncrease (decrease)\n(Millions of dollars)\n2025\n2024\n10% appreciation in U.S. dollar\n$\n(42)\n$\n(143)\n10% depreciation in U.S. dollar\n$\n68 \n$\n147 \nThese calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments.\n48\nTable of Contents\nInterest Rate Risk\nWhen managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities. \nThe impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2025 and 2024, as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period, based upon our overall interest rate exposure, were estimated as follows:\nIncrease (decrease) to fair value of interest rate derivatives outstanding\nIncrease (decrease) to earnings or cash flows\n(Millions of dollars)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n10% increase in interest rates\n$\n(11)\n$\n(12)\n$\n(1)\n$\n5 \n10% decrease in interest rates\n$\n11 \n$\n12 \n$\n1 \n$\n(5)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur strong financial position and cash flow performance have provided us with the capacity to accelerate our innovation pipeline through investments in research and development, as well as through strategic acquisitions. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, our ability to generate operating cash flow, and if needed, our access to borrowings from our financing facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our foreseeable operating needs. The following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2025, 2024 and 2023:\n(Millions of dollars)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by (used for) operations\nContinuing operating activities\n$\n3,430 \n$\n3,844 \n$\n2,990 \nInvesting activities\n$\n(818)\n$\n(5,514)\n$\n(716)\nFinancing activities\n$\n(3,617)\n$\n2,087 \n$\n(1,956)\nNet Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities in 2025 were largely driven by our net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCash and Short-term Investments\nAt September 30, 2025, total worldwide cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash, were $859 million and were primarily held outside of the United States. We regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments held outside of the United States and our historical foreign earnings are used to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. To fund cash needs in the United States, we rely on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and remittances from foreign subsidiaries of earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested.\nFinancing Facilities\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company refinanced its senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was to expire in September 2027, with a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in September 2030. The credit facility provides borrowings of up to $2.750 billion, with separate sub-limits of $100 million and $236 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively. The expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to certain restrictions (including the consent of the lenders). The credit facility provides that we may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional $500 million of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to $3.250 billion. Proceeds from this facility may be used for general corporate purposes and Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l., an indirect, wholly owned finance subsidiary of BD, is authorized as an additional borrower under the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2025.\nThe agreement for our revolving credit facility contains the following financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants, as applicable, as of September 30, 2025.\n•\nWe are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than:\n◦\n4.25-to-1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter following the closing of the credit facility; or\n◦\n4.75-to-1 for the five full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition.\nWe may access commercial paper programs over the normal course of our business activities. Our U.S. and multicurrency euro commercial paper programs provide for a maximum amount of unsecured borrowings under the two programs, in aggregate, of $2.750 billion. Proceeds from these programs may be used for working capital purposes and general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, share repurchases and repayments of debt. We had $855 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2025. We have additional informal lines of credit outside the United States. Also, over the normal course of our business activities, we transfer certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements. Additional disclosures regarding sales of trade receivable assets are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n51\nTable of Contents\nAccess to Capital and Credit Ratings\nOur corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody's Investors Service (“Moody's”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) were as follows at September 30, 2025:\n \n  \nS&P\n  \nMoody’s\nFitch\nRatings:\n  \n  \nSenior Unsecured Debt\n  \nBBB\nBaa2\nBBB\nCommercial Paper\n  \nA-2\nP-2\nF2\nOutlook\n  \nStable\nStable\nStable\nOur corporate credit ratings at September 30, 2025 were unchanged compared with our ratings at September 30, 2024.\nLower corporate debt ratings and downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing. We believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under purchase, debt and lease arrangements are provided in Notes 6, 16 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following policy areas require more significant judgment:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For leases and for certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.\n52\nTable of Contents\nOur agreements with customers within certain organizational units, primarily Medication Management Solutions, Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations that include both products and certain services noted above. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment. The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and in consideration of typical discounts offered to customers. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of deferred revenue.\nOur gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, including rebates. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and require judgment when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period. Additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates.\nImpairment of Assets\nGoodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units represent one level below reporting segments. Our review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment test performed on July 1, 2025 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nWe generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BD’s business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nBD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.\nBD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BD’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.\n53\nTable of Contents\nWe have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. As a result, we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2025. Additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nContingencies\nWe are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters in certain U.S. and international locations, as further discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We establish accruals to the extent losses for individual matters are probable and reasonably estimable based upon our assessment of the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes relative to these matters, as well as the potential ranges of probable losses. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to reasonably estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of litigation in which the Company is a party.\nWhen appropriate, accruals are developed with the consultation of outside counsel regarding the nature, timing and extent of each matter. The accruals may change in the future as new information for an individual matter becomes available or due to changes in our litigation strategy. We record expected recoveries, up to the amount of loss recognized, from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable.\nGiven the uncertain nature of litigation, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance and any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and/or consolidated cash flows.\nBenefit Plans\nWe have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations and costs that are measured using actuarial valuations, which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.\nThe discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). Specifically for the U.S. plans, we will use a discount rate of 5.25% for 2026, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date. To calculate the pension expense in 2026, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. Additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2026 are provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.5% for the U.S. pension plan in 2026. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.\n54\nTable of Contents\nSensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows:\n•\nDiscount rate — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $3 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs. This estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost.\n•\nExpected return on plan assets — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $4 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan costs.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. BD and its representatives may also, from time to time, make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth, and cash flows) and statements regarding our strategy for growth, liquidity, future product development, regulatory approvals, competitive position and expenditures. All statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.\nThe following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\n•\nGeneral global, regional or national economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility (including volatility resulting from the imposition of (and changing policies around) tariffs and related countermeasures), import or export licensing requirements, other governmental restrictions, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, that may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and services, impact the prices we can charge for our products and services, disrupt aspects of our supply chain, impair our ability to produce our products, or increase borrowing costs.\n•\nThe impact of inflation, tariffs, and disruptions in our global supply chain on us and our suppliers (particularly sole-source suppliers and providers of sterilization services), including fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in the production or sterilization of our products, transportation constraints, disruptions and delays, product shortages, energy shortages or increased energy costs, labor shortages or disputes, and increased operating and labor costs.\n•\nThe risks associated with the proposed combination of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters, including factors that could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the \n55\nTable of Contents\ncompletion, timing or terms of the proposed transaction, or our ability to realize the expected benefits of the proposed transaction.\n•\nConditions in international markets, including social and political conditions, geopolitical developments such as the continuation and/or escalation of the situation in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, civil unrest, political conflict, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, economic sanctions, export controls, tariffs and other protectionist measures, barriers to market participation (such as local company and products preferences), difficulties in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and governmental expropriation of assets. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and bribery laws, as well as regulatory and privacy laws. \n•\nThe impact of changes in U.S. federal or foreign laws and policies that could affect fiscal and tax policies, taxation (including tax reforms such as the Pillar Two framework) and international trade, including import and export licensing regulation and international trade agreements. In particular, tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. (and countermeasures by non-U.S. governments) could adversely impact demand for our products and services, our supply chain costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations and future growth. The ultimate impact of any existing or new tariffs or other changes in international trade policies is subject to a number of factors including the duration of such tariffs, changes in tariff rates, the scope and nature of the tariffs, any countermeasures that target countries may take and the availability of any mitigating actions. In addition, our tariff mitigation strategies may be challenged, rejected or eliminated through legislation or other challenges, or may otherwise not be effective.\n•\nCost-containment efforts in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, such as alternative payment reform, government-imposed pay back provisions, increased use of competitive bidding and tenders, including, without limitation, any expansion of the volume-based procurement process in China or the Center for Medicaid Services’ Competitive Bidding Program, reimbursement policy changes or the implementation of similar cost-containment efforts.\n•\nCompetitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions and technologies, including the use of emerging technologies (such as AI) by our current or future competitors, consolidation or strategic alliances among healthcare companies, distributors and/or payers of healthcare to improve their competitive position or develop new models for the delivery of healthcare, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), new entrants into our markets, changes in the practice of medicine or the development of alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device.\n•\nProduct efficacy or safety concerns, changes to the labeled use of our products, non-compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding our products (such as non-compliance of our products with marketing authorization or registration requirements resulting from modifications to such products, or other factors, including, but not limited to, with respect to BD Alaris™ System and infusion sets and BD Vacutainer\nTM\n, resulting in product recalls, lost revenue or other actions being taken with respect to products in the field or the ability to continue selling new products to customers (including restrictions on future product clearances and civil penalties), product liability or other claims and damage to our reputation, including products we acquire through acquisitions. \n•\nAs a result of the CareFusion acquisition, our U.S. infusion pump business is operating under a Consent Decree with the FDA. The Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order our U.S. infusion pump business to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and order the payment of significant monetary damages if the business subject to the decree fails to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree. In accordance with our commitments to the FDA, the overall timing of replacement of the BD Alaris™ Infusion Systems and \n56\nTable of Contents\nreturn to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity and our continued engagement with the FDA.\n•\nPolicy and regulatory changes implemented by the U.S. federal government, including the downsizing and reduced funding of certain government agencies and programs as well as changes in the policy positions of such agencies, including the FDA, may affect the approach of agencies with which we typically engage and make regulatory approval processes and ongoing compliance with all applicable rules and regulations more challenging.\n•\nDeficit reduction efforts, policy changes, or other actions that reduce or freeze the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, which could weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.\n•\nFluctuations and pauses in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for research.\n•\nCompetitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions and technologies, including the use of emerging technologies (such as AI) by our current or future competitors, changes in demand as a result of changes to U.S. federal and state policies (affecting products such as pharmaceuticals and vaccines), consolidation or strategic alliances among healthcare companies, distributors and/or payers of healthcare to improve their competitive position or develop new models for the delivery of healthcare, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), new entrants into our markets and changes in the practice of medicine.\n•\nChanges in the way healthcare services are delivered, including transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management, which may affect the demand for our products and services. Additionally, budget constraints and staffing shortages, particularly shortages of nursing staff, may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products and services.\n•\nOur ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.\n•\nChanges in market dynamics, coverage policies or reimbursement practices, or adverse third-party payer cost containment measures relating to our products and services, which could reduce demand for our products or the price we can charge for such products.\n•\nChanges in the domestic and foreign healthcare industry, in medical or clinical practices or in patient preferences that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including cost-reduction measures instituted by and the continued consolidation among healthcare providers.\n•\nThe effects of regulatory or other events that adversely impact our supply chain, including our ability to manufacture or sterilize our products (particularly where production of a product line or sterilization operations are concentrated in one or a few plants), source materials or components or services from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing or sterilization, or provide products to our customers, including events that impact key distributors. In particular, there has been increased regulatory focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide in sterilization processes, and additional regulatory requirements may be imposed in the future that could adversely impact us or our third-party sterilization providers.\n•\nIT system disruptions, breaches or breakdowns, including through cyberattacks, ransom attacks or cyber-intrusion, which could impair our ability or that of our customers, suppliers and other business partners to conduct business, result in the loss of our trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information \n57\nTable of Contents\nof BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of patients, including sensitive personal data, or result in efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products, and result in investigations, legal proceedings, liability, expense or reputational damage or actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.\n•\nDifficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, clearances and registrations in the U.S. and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which could preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies due to government shutdowns or reductions in government staffing or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.\n•\nThe impact of business combinations or divestitures, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquisition-related costs, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.\n•\nRisks relating to our overall level of indebtedness, including our ability to service our debt and refinance our indebtedness, which is dependent upon the capital markets and the overall macroeconomic environment and our financial condition at such time.\n•\nThe risks associated with the qualification of the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n•\nRisks associated with our development, deployment and use of AI in our products and business operations.\n•\nOur ability to penetrate or expand our operations in emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks.\n•\nOur ability to recruit and retain key employees and the impact of labor conditions which could increase employee turnover or increase our labor and operating costs and negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our business.\n•\nFluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation, the development of alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device, or otherwise.\n•\nThe impact of climate change, legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, such as regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, zero-carbon energy and sustainability mandates and related disclosure requirements, and additional taxes on fuel and energy, or related sustainability efforts, and changing customer and other stakeholder preferences and requirements, such as those regarding the use of materials of concern, shifting demand for products with lower environmental footprints, and for progress toward sustainability goals and greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n•\nNatural disasters, including the impacts of hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events, public health crises (such as pandemics and epidemics), war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts that could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability, resulting in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or cause interruptions in our supply chain, and our response may involve the implementation of measures which may not be successful.\n•\nPending and potential future litigation or other proceedings asserting, and/or investigations concerning and/or subpoenas and requests seeking information with respect to, alleged violations of law (including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid), government contracts and/or sales and marketing practices (such as investigative subpoenas and the civil \n58\nTable of Contents\ninvestigative demands received by us)), potential anti-corruption and related internal control violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, antitrust claims, securities law claims, environmental and product liability matters (including pending claims relating to ethylene oxide, our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women, vena cava filter products and implantable ports, which involve, or could involve in the future, lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district or other consolidated proceedings), data privacy breaches and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.\n•\nNew or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including, without limitation, laws relating to sales practices, healthcare, environmental protection and reporting, price controls, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, AI, employment, labor and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the post-marketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. New environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, may also increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to us.\n•\nThe effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding our business or operations, including the effect on our reputation or demand for its products.\n•\nThe effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in our pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require us to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.\n•\nOur ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.\nThe foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.\n59\nTable of Contents",
