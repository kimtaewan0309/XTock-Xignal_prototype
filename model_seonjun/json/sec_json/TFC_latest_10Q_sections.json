MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, other information contained in this document, as well as with Truist’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nA description of certain factors that may affect our future results and risk factors is set forth in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nExecutive Overview\nTruist delivered strong third-quarter results, underscored by robust fee income growth in investment banking and trading and wealth, healthy loan expansion, and continued expense and credit discipline. These results reflect the strength of our diversified business model and the momentum we are seeing across the Company.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, Truist announced strategic growth investments over the next five years. The investments include building 100 new insights-driven branches, renovating more than 300 branches in high-opportunity markets, enhancing digital capabilities, and hiring additional Premier advisors to serve clients with more complex financial needs.\nAsset quality was solid, and our capital position continues to support both our growth initiatives and our ability to return capital to shareholders. We returned $1.2 billion of capital to our common shareholders through $665 million of common stock dividends and $500 million in common share repurchases during the third quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2025, we had $2.3 billion remaining under our $5.0 billion common share repurchase authorization through the end of 2026.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company is targeting the repurchase of $750 million of common stock through open market repurchases.\nFinancial Results\nNet income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2025 of $1.3 billion was up 0.9% compared with the third quarter of 2024. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the third quarter of 2025 were $1.04, an increase of $0.05, or 5.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. Truist’s results of operations for the third quarter of 2025 produced an annualized return on average assets of 1.06% and an annualized return on average common shareholders’ equity of 9.0% compared to prior year returns of 1.10% and 9.1%, respectively.\nNet income from continuing operations was $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2024.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2025 was up $23 million, or 0.6%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. Net interest margin was 3.01%, down 11 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2024\n•\nThe yield on the average total loan portfolio was 6.00%, down 41 basis points due to the impact of variable rate loans repricing. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 3.16%, up 19 basis points.\n•\nThe average cost of total deposits was 1.84%, down 24 basis points. The average cost of short-term borrowings was 4.42%, down 99 basis points. The average cost of long-term debt was 5.04%, down nine basis points.\nNoninterest income was up $75 million, or 5.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher wealth management income and service charges on deposits.\nNoninterest expense was up $87 million, or 3.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher personnel expense, partially offset by lower other expense.\nThe effective tax rate was 16.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 15.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The higher effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 is primarily due to higher income before taxes and higher full-year forecasted effective tax rate in the current year.\nTruist Financial Corporation   49\nAsset quality was solid for the third quarter of 2025.\n•\nNonperforming loans and leases held for investment were 0.48% of loans and leases held for investment at September 30, 2025, up nine basis points compared to June 30, 2025 due to an increase in the commercial and industrial portfolio.\n•\nLoans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $584 million at September 30, 2025, up one basis point as a percentage of loans and leases compared with June 30, 2025. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.05% at September 30, 2025, up one basis point compared to June 30, 2025.\n•\nThe allowance for credit losses was $5.3 billion and included $5.0 billion for the allowance for loan and lease losses and $317 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.54%, flat compared to June 30, 2025.\n•\nThe provision for credit losses was $436 million compared to $448 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n•\nThe net charge-off ratio was 48 basis points, down seven basis points compared to the third quarter of 2024, primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in the CRE and credit card portfolios, partially offset by the indirect auto portfolio.\nCapital and liquidity ratios remained strong during the third quarter of 2025.\n•\nTruist’s preliminary CET1 ratio was 11.0% as of September 30, 2025, flat compared to June 30, 2025 as capital returned to shareholders and an increase in risk-weighted assets was offset by current quarter earnings.\n•\nTruist declared common dividends of $0.52 per share during the third quarter of 2025 and repurchased $500 million of common stock. For the third quarter of 2025, the dividend payout ratio was 50%, and the total payout ratio was 87%.\n•\nTruist’s average consolidated LCR was 110% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n•\nTruist completed the 2025 CCAR process and received an SCB requirement of 2.5% for the period October 1, 2025 to September 30, 2026, down 30 basis points from the SCB requirement for the period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.\n50   Truist Financial Corporation\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nNet Interest Income and NIM\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2025 was up $23 million, or 0.6%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. Net interest margin was 3.01%, down 11 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n•\nAverage earning assets increased $19.9 billion, or 4.3%, primarily due to an increase in average total loans of $17.5 billion, or 5.7%, and an increase in average securities of $2.0 billion, or 1.7%.\n•\nThe yield on the average total loan portfolio was 6.00%, down 41 basis points due to the impact of variable rate loans repricing. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 3.16%, up 19 basis points.\n•\nAverage deposits increased $12.3 billion, or 3.2%, average short-term borrowings increased $6.0 billion, or 29%, and average long-term debt increased $6.1 billion, or 17%.\n•\nThe average cost of total deposits was 1.84%, down 24 basis points. The average cost of short-term borrowings was 4.42%, down 99 basis points. The average cost of long-term debt was 5.04%, down nine basis points.\nTE net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was up $208 million, or 2.0%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the balance sheet repositioning in the second quarter of 2024. Net interest margin was 3.01%, flat compared to the prior period.\n•\nAverage earning assets increased $8.9 billion, or 1.9%, compared to the prior period primarily due to an increase in average total loans of $7.3 billion, or 2.4%, and an increase in other earning assets of $2.8 billion, or 7.7%, partially offset by a decline in average securities of $1.8 billion, or 1.5%. The increase in average other earning assets and decrease in average securities primarily reflects the aforementioned balance sheet repositioning.\n•\nThe yield on the average total loan portfolio was 5.99% for 2025, down 42 basis points, compared to the prior period primarily due to the impact of variable rate loans repricing. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 3.16% for 2025, up 44 basis points compared to the prior period, reflecting the balance sheet repositioning and reinvesting cash flows into higher yielding securities.\n•\nAverage deposits increased $9.3 billion, or 2.4%, average short-term borrowings increased $3.4 billion, or 14%, and average long-term debt decreased $1.5 billion, or 4.0%.\n•\nThe average cost of total deposits was 1.83% for 2025, down 24 basis points compared to the prior period. The average cost of short-term borrowings was 4.46% for 2025, down 109 basis points compared to the prior period. The average cost of long-term debt was 5.04% for 2025, up 14 basis points compared to the prior period.\nThe major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes are summarized below.\nTruist Financial Corporation   51\nTable 1-1: Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income and Rate / Volume Analysis\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in millions)\nAverage Balances\n(1)\nAnnualized Yield/Rate\n(2)\nIncome/Expense\n(2)\nIncr.\n(Decr.)\nChange due to\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRate\nVolume\nAssets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAFS and HTM securities at amortized cost:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury\n$\n13,351 \n$\n12,986 \n5.18 \n%\n4.65 \n%\n$\n174 \n$\n151 \n$\n23 \n$\n19 \n$\n4 \nGSE\n458 \n377 \n3.86 \n3.41 \n4 \n4 \n— \n— \n— \nAgency MBS\n104,998 \n103,374 \n2.89 \n2.75 \n760 \n711 \n49 \n38 \n11 \nStates and political subdivisions\n358 \n417 \n4.19 \n4.14 \n3 \n3 \n— \n— \n— \nNon-agency MBS\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nOther\n15 \n18 \n4.50 \n5.18 \n1 \n1 \n— \n— \n— \nTotal securities\n119,180 \n117,172 \n3.16 \n2.97 \n942 \n870 \n72 \n57 \n15 \nInterest earning trading assets\n5,991 \n5,454 \n5.70 \n6.05 \n86 \n84 \n2 \n(5)\n7 \nOther earning assets\n(3)\n38,765 \n38,933 \n4.50 \n5.54 \n445 \n549 \n(104)\n(102)\n(2)\nLoans and leases, net of unearned income:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommercial and industrial\n162,207 \n154,102 \n5.66 \n6.41 \n2,312 \n2,482 \n(170)\n(298)\n128 \nCRE\n21,171 \n21,481 \n6.25 \n6.88 \n336 \n373 \n(37)\n(32)\n(5)\nCommercial Construction\n8,258 \n7,870 \n6.84 \n7.79 \n139 \n152 \n(13)\n(20)\n7 \nResidential mortgage\n57,676 \n53,999 \n4.15 \n3.89 \n598 \n525 \n73 \n37 \n36 \nHome equity\n9,588 \n9,703 \n7.51 \n8.04 \n182 \n196 \n(14)\n(12)\n(2)\nIndirect auto\n24,964 \n22,121 \n7.29 \n7.18 \n459 \n399 \n60 \n6 \n54 \nOther consumer\n31,714 \n29,015 \n8.36 \n8.26 \n668 \n603 \n65 \n7 \n58 \nCredit card\n4,915 \n4,874 \n11.74 \n12.20 \n146 \n150 \n(4)\n(5)\n1 \nTotal loans and leases HFI\n320,493 \n303,165 \n6.00 \n6.41 \n4,840 \n4,880 \n(40)\n(317)\n277 \nLHFS\n1,577 \n1,413 \n6.18 \n6.49 \n24 \n24 \n— \n(2)\n2 \nTotal loans and leases\n322,070 \n304,578 \n6.00 \n6.41 \n4,864 \n4,904 \n(40)\n(319)\n279 \nTotal earning assets\n486,006 \n466,137 \n5.18 \n5.47 \n6,337 \n6,407 \n(70)\n(369)\n299 \nNonearning assets\n55,819 \n53,278 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal assets\n$\n541,825 \n$\n519,415 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLiabilities and Shareholders’ Equity\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest-bearing deposits:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest-checking\n$\n109,244 \n$\n103,899 \n2.46 \n2.80 \n677 \n732 \n(55)\n(91)\n36 \nMoney market and savings\n136,515 \n136,639 \n2.19 \n2.66 \n755 \n914 \n(159)\n(158)\n(1)\nTime deposits\n45,090 \n37,726 \n3.54 \n3.88 \n403 \n368 \n35 \n(34)\n69 \nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n290,849 \n278,264 \n2.50 \n2.88 \n1,835 \n2,014 \n(179)\n(283)\n104 \nShort-term borrowings\n26,796 \n20,781 \n4.42 \n5.41 \n299 \n282 \n17 \n(57)\n74 \nLong-term debt\n41,458 \n35,318 \n5.04 \n5.13 \n523 \n454 \n69 \n(8)\n77 \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n359,103 \n334,363 \n2.94 \n3.27 \n2,657 \n2,750 \n(93)\n(348)\n255 \nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n105,751 \n106,080 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther liabilities\n11,922 \n13,631 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShareholders’ equity\n65,049 \n65,341 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity\n$\n541,825 \n$\n519,415 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAverage interest-rate spread\n \n \n2.24 \n%\n2.20 \n%\n \n \n \n \n \nNIM/net interest income - TE\n(2)\n \n \n3.01 \n%\n3.12 \n%\n$\n3,680 \n$\n3,657 \n$\n23 \n$\n(21)\n$\n44 \nLess: TE adjustment\n \n \n \n \n51 \n55 \n \n \n \nNet interest income\n$\n3,629 \n$\n3,602 \nMemo: Total deposits\n$\n396,600 \n$\n384,344 \n1.84 \n%\n2.08 \n%\n$\n1,835 \n$\n2,014 \n$\n(179)\n(1)\nRepresents daily average balances.

The net charge-off ratio for the current quarter of 0.48% was down seven basis points compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n•\nThe net charge-off ratio for the current quarter was down compared to the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in the CRE and credit card portfolios, partially offset by the indirect auto portfolio.\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, flat compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net charge-off ratio for the current period of 0.53% was down six basis points compared to the prior period.\n•\nThe net charge-off ratio was down compared to the prior period driven by lower net charge-offs in the CRE, credit card, and other consumer portfolios, partially offset by higher net charge-offs in the commercial and industrial and indirect auto portfolios.\nRefer to “Note 5. Loans and ACL” for additional discussion of the ACL.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist’s financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce Truist’s reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

Management is involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk acceptance criteria are adjusted as needed to reflect the Company’s risk appetite. Consistent with established risk management objectives, the Company utilizes various risk mitigation techniques, including collecting collateral and security interests, obtaining guarantees, and, to a limited extent, through the purchase of credit loss protection via third-party insurance or use of credit derivatives such as credit default swaps.\nIn the commercial portfolio, risk concentrations are evaluated regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client basis. The Company manages its commercial exposure through portfolio targets, limits, and transactional risk acceptance criteria as well as other techniques, including loan syndications/participations, loan sales, collateral, structure, covenants, and other risk reduction techniques.\nThe following tables provide industry distribution by major types of commercial credit exposure and the geographical distribution of commercial exposures. Industry classification for commercial and industrial loans is based on the North American Industry Classification System. CRE loans are classified based on type of property.

Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter.\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. Truist estimates credit losses on second lien loans where the first lien is delinquent based on historical experience; the increased risk of loss on these credits is reflected in the ALLL. As of September 30, 2025, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 32% of its second lien positions.\nOther Assets\nThe components of other assets are presented in the following table:\nTable 15: Other Assets as of Period End\n(Dollars in millions)\nSep 30, 2025\nDec 31, 2024\nTax credit and other private equity investments\n$\n9,705 \n$\n9,303 \nBank-owned life insurance\n7,873 \n7,801 \nPrepaid pension assets\n7,407 \n7,238 \nAccounts receivable\n2,126 \n1,904 \nAccrued income\n2,093 \n2,069 \nDerivative assets\n1,684 \n966 \nDTAs, net\n1,644 \n1,945 \nLeased and related assets\n1,426 \n1,352 \nFHLB stock\n1,395 \n965 \nPrepaid expenses\n1,063 \n1,061 \nROU assets\n1,059 \n1,015 \nOther\n1,188 \n1,513 \nTotal other assets\n$\n38,663 \n$\n37,132 \nTruist Financial Corporation   65\nFunding Activities\nDeposits\nThe following table presents average deposits:\nTable 16: Average Deposits\nThree Months Ended\n(Dollars in millions)\nSep 30, 2025\nJun 30, 2025\nMar 31, 2025\nDec 31, 2024\nSep 30, 2024\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n$\n105,751 \n$\n106,686 \n$\n105,895 \n$\n107,968 \n$\n106,080 \nInterest checking\n109,244 \n116,193 \n109,208 \n107,075 \n103,899 \nMoney market and savings\n136,515 \n135,607 \n136,897 \n138,242 \n136,639 \nTime deposits\n45,090 \n41,997 \n40,204 \n36,757 \n37,726 \nTotal average deposits\n$\n396,600 \n$\n400,483 \n$\n392,204 \n$\n390,042 \n$\n384,344 \nAverage deposits for the third quarter of 2025 were $396.6 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion, or 1.0%, compared to the second quarter of 2025 primarily due to lower short-term client deposits.\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 0.9% compared to the prior quarter and represented 26.7% of total deposits for the third quarter of 2025 compared to 26.6% for the second quarter of 2025.

A key objective of the Company’s risk management framework is to promote the execution of strategic goals and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite.\nTruist has developed a risk management taxonomy to provide for the identification and classification of risk elements at Truist. The objective of the risk management taxonomy is to define enterprise-wide categorization for elements used in risk management activities, establish consistently applied language, and enable data analysis, aggregation, and reporting. Primary risk types are the highest categories of risk in our risk management taxonomy. We recently updated our primary risk types to include financial crimes risk. The other seven primary risk types in our current risk management taxonomy are market, credit, liquidity, technology, compliance, strategic, and operational risks. See Item 1, “Business”, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and the “Risk Management” section of MD&A in Truist’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for additional information regarding these primary risk types.\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture that supports the identification and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company’s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company’s culture. The Truist code of ethics influences the Company’s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance.\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities must be evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or economic value arising from changes in interest rates, spreads, or prices of financial instruments, and the corresponding impact on the composition of the balance sheet or trading and fair value positions. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility, or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices.\nTruist’s most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk, and volatility risk of instruments held in Truist’s business units. Interest rate risk results from: differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk).\nThe primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income, and capital, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function.\nInterest Rate Market Risk\nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions. Truist primarily monitors this risk through two measurement types, (i) NII at risk and (ii) economic value of equity. Truist manages this risk with securities, derivatives, and broader asset liability management activities. Truist uses derivatives to hedge interest income variability of floating rate loans and to hedge valuation changes of long-term debt and investment securities.\nIRR measurement is reported monthly through the ALCO. Monthly IRR reporting includes exposure and historical trends relative to risk limit scenarios, impacts to a wide range of rate scenarios, and sensitivity tests of key assumptions. IRR reporting is provided to the BRC quarterly.\nIRR measurement is influenced by data, assumptions, and models. Due to their high sensitivity to market rates, mortgage (loan and security) prepayments leverage an industry model that results in varying prepayment speeds across rate scenarios. Prepayments for non-mortgage loans leverage a mix of dynamic models (varying results based on market rates) and static prepayment assumptions based on historical experience. Our analysis incorporates dynamic client deposit balance levels, the mix across product types, and deposit rate paid across alternate rate scenarios based on modeled changes in client and bank behavior. The use of dynamic deposit balance models results in rotation to higher cost funding products (e.g., CDs) when market rates increase and to lower cost funding products (e.g., non-maturity deposits) when market rates decrease. The use of dynamic rate paid models results in varying deposit betas based on the timing and conditions within market rate cycles.\n68   Truist Financial Corporation\nNII at risk measures the change in NII under alternate interest rate scenarios relative to Truist’s baseline scenario, which incorporates Truist’s current balance sheet and off-balance sheet hedges as well as expectations for new business over the forecast horizon. Truist’s baseline scenario relies on assumptions including expectations of the economy and interest rates – which are influenced by market conditions, new business volume, pricing, and client behavior. In measuring NII at risk, Truist assumes that changes in key factors, such as prepayments and deposit pricing (betas), largely move in line with those it has experienced in prior rate cycles. However, future behavior of key factors may vary from Truist’s assumptions. NII at risk measurement assumes, when applicable, that U.S. interest rates floor at zero and Truist does not take any balance sheet or hedging actions in response to the rate scenarios.\nTruist evaluates a wide range of alternate scenarios including instantaneous and gradual as well as parallel and non-parallel changes in interest rates. The table below presents the estimated change to NII over the following 12 months for select parallel alternate scenarios, expressed as a percentage change relative to baseline NII.\nTable 18: Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis\nSep 30, 2025\nDec 31, 2024\nUp 200bps gradual change in interest rates\n0.7 \n%\n1.1 \n%\nUp 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates\n0.5 \n0.6 \nDown 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates\n(0.7)\n(0.8)\nDown 200bps gradual change in interest rates\n(1.8)\n(2.1)\nTruist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of key assumptions used in NII risk including:\n•\nAsset prepayment speeds\n•\nNew loan volume pricing spreads\n•\nInterest-bearing deposit betas\n•\nNon-interest-bearing demand deposit balance runoff, replaced by market funding\nEVE measures changes in the economic value of Truist’s current balance sheet and off-balance sheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios relative to starting economic value. Truist uses EVE as a longer-term measure of interest rate risk. Truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of key assumptions used in EVE including:\n•\nAsset prepayment speeds\n•\nMortgage spreads (mortgage loan and security valuations)\n•\nInterest-bearing deposit beta\n•\nDeposit runoff / decay\nKey assumption tests are generally performed by increasing and decreasing the assumption, whether static or dynamically modeled, relative to their respective starting values and then measuring the resulting impact to NII and EVE under baseline and alternate rate scenarios.\nThe identification and testing of key assumptions are influenced by market conditions and management views of key risks. The results of key assumption sensitivity tests are reported to ALCO and BRC at least quarterly. Key assumptions and their associated sensitivity tests are reviewed with ALCO and BRC at least annually.\nMarket Risk from Trading Activities\nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange, and securities markets, which generate market risks. Trading market risk is managed using a multi-faceted risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level.\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule.\nTruist Financial Corporation   69\nCovered Trading Positions\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. Truist’s trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the Company’s clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker across different asset classes, Truist’s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures.\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions. Additionally, these positions are subject to independent price verification. See “Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments,” “Note 15. Fair Value Disclosures,” and “Critical Accounting Policies” herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies.\nSecuritizations\nAs of September 30, 2025, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule, which were non-agency asset backed securities positions, was $120 million. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics, including deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist’s risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period.\nCorrelation Trading Positions\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of September 30, 2025.\nVaR-Based Measures\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. The VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to manage market risk include stress testing, scenario analysis, and stop loss limits.\nThe trading portfolio’s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Average VaR measures in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were higher compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to elevated market volatility in April 2025.\n70   Truist Financial Corporation\nTable 19: VaR-based Measures\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(Dollars in millions)\n10-Day Holding Period\n1-Day Holding Period\n10-Day Holding Period\n1-Day Holding Period\n10-Day Holding Period\n1-Day Holding Period\n10-Day Holding Period\n1-Day Holding Period\nVaR-based Measures:\nMaximum\n$\n35 \n$\n12 \n$\n28 \n$\n10 \n$\n63 \n$\n15 \n$\n28 \n$\n12 \nAverage\n22 \n8 \n21 \n6 \n23 \n9 \n21 \n7 \nMinimum\n14 \n6 \n12 \n4 \n9 \n4 \n12 \n4 \nPeriod-end\n28 \n8 \n22 \n6 \n28 \n8 \n22 \n6 \nVaR by Risk Class:\nInterest Rate Risk\n5 \n7 \n5 \n7 \nCredit Spread Risk\n5 \n9 \n5 \n9 \nEquity Price Risk\n7 \n4 \n7 \n4 \nForeign Exchange Risk\n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \nPortfolio Diversification\n(11)\n(15)\n(11)\n(15)\nPeriod-end\n8 \n6 \n8 \n6 \nStressed VaR-based measures\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the Company’s trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures:\nTable 20: Stressed VaR-based Measures - 10 Day Holding Period\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nMaximum\n$\n147 \n$\n198 \n$\n287 \n$\n209 \nAverage\n94 \n151 \n133 \n137 \nMinimum\n56 \n114 \n56 \n69 \nPeriod-end\n127 \n173 \n127 \n173 \nSpecific Risk Measures\nSpecific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g., default or event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply.\nVaR Model Backtesting\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. As illustrated in the following graph, there was one Company-wide VaR backtesting exception during the twelve months ended September 30, 2025. The backtesting exception was driven by tariff-related market volatility. The total number of Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the VaR-based capital requirement under the Market Risk Rule. The capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. There was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months.\nTruist Financial Corporation   71\nModel Risk Oversight\nMRO is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision models, including trading market risk models. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models is reviewed regularly to evaluate model performance with emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and identify potential model enhancement.\nStress Testing\nThe Company uses a range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for risk factor sensitivities, historical repeats, and hypothetical scenarios with varying liquidity horizons of key risk factors. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (i.e., interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company’s stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios and makes updates on an ongoing basis. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company’s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the “Capital” section of MD&A for additional discussion of capital adequacy.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable costs. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and highly liquid unencumbered securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment, and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale.\nTruist has a liquidity risk management process designed to identify, measure, and monitor key liquidity risks to assess whether Truist is operating within its liquidity risk appetite. The liquidity risk appetite is outlined using a qualitative statement and more granular detailed risk appetite statements aligned to Truist’s risk taxonomy; risk statements form the basis for aligning risk appetite with risk management goals and strategy. Using the risk appetite statements, key risk indicators are developed that represent quantitative metrics which measure current risk exposure relative to Truist’s risk appetite, which help the Board and management monitor liquidity risk taking activity. Truist’s key risk indicators are designed to support the following objectives:\n•\nmaintain (i) a diversified, but client deposit centric, funding base, (ii) a level of liquid, readily monetized assets sufficient to satisfy business as usual and stressed cash flow needs across multiple liquidity horizons, and (iii) an appropriate level of contingent funding to meet any unexpected needs;\n•\nlimit concentration risk from individual, correlated counterparties, and funding concentrations in tenors that may negatively impact Truist from an unforeseen idiosyncratic or market event; and\n•\nmaintain sufficient liquidity in the holding company to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries.\n72   Truist Financial Corporation\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\nLiquidity stress testing is conducted for Truist and Truist Bank using a variety of institution-specific and market-wide adverse scenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons. The types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition, contractual maturities, reductions in unsecured and secured funding, increased draws on unfunded commitments, and the potential need to post additional collateral for derivatives. To mitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has identified sources of liquidity; however, access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment.\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is designed to meet the projected 30-day net stressed cash-flow needs. Truist’s liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as HQLA under the LCR Rule. Truist periodically monetizes a representative sample of the liquidity buffer to assess operational readiness through available monetization channels.\nContingency Funding Plan\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed to address ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization’s liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan’s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The plan addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. On a quarterly basis, Truist conducts testing of market access for alternative sources of funds (e.g. FRB, discount window, standing repo facility, etc.) to test operational readiness. On a periodic basis, Truist conducts a table-top test of the Contingency Funding Plan to assess reliability of the plan during liquidity stress events and to simulate the operational elements of the plan such as communications, coordination, and decision-making.\nLCR, NSFR, and HQLA\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist Bank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient within the parameters of the rule to meet their estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational requirements of the LCR rule. Truist and Truist Bank are subject to the Category III reduced LCR requirements. Truist held average weighted eligible HQLA of $91.2 billion and Truist’s average LCR was 110% for the three months ended September 30, 2025.\nThe NSFR rule defines a minimum amount of stable, long-term funding that Truist and Truist Bank must maintain in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. Truist and Truist Bank are subject to the Category III reduced NSFR requirements. At September 30, 2025, Truist was compliant with this requirement.\nSources of Funds\nTruist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits, secured and unsecured capital markets funding, and shareholders’ equity. Truist Bank’s primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested.\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. These sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional CDs, overnight and term Federal funds markets, and retail brokered CDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources, including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB discount window. Available investment securities could be pledged to create additional secured borrowing capacity. The following table presents a summary of Truist Bank’s available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the FRB:\nTable 21: Selected Liquidity Sources\n(Dollars in millions)\nSep 30, 2025\nDec 31, 2024\nUnused borrowing capacity:\nFRB\n$\n82,361 \n$\n72,040 \nFHLB\n24,947 \n31,411 \nAvailable investment securities (at fair value)\n69,612 \n68,212 \nAvailable secured borrowing capacity\n176,920 \n171,663 \nEligible cash at the FRB\n31,313 \n33,717 \nTotal\n$\n208,233 \n$\n205,380 \nTruist Financial Corporation   73\nAt September 30, 2025, Truist Bank’s available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately 4.1 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one year or less.\nParent Company\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for its operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company’s assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, repurchases of common stock, payments on and, from time-to-time, potential repurchases or redemptions of a portion of an outstanding tranche of long-term debt of the Parent Company (as may be permitted by the terms of each respective series), and the redemption of preferred stock. See “Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information” in Truist’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions.\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist manages cash levels at the Parent Company to exceed a minimum of 12 months of projected cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At September 30, 2025, the Parent Company held cash on hand to meet these requirements.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of rating agencies as to the Company’s ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance. Credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. The Company’s credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-quality credit ratings, management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and business updates and to discuss current outlooks and trends. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Truist’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for additional information regarding factors that influence credit ratings and potential risks that could materialize in the event of downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings.\nThe following table presents the credit ratings and outlooks of the Parent Company and Truist Bank as of September 30, 2025:\nTable 22: Credit Ratings of Truist Financial Corporation and Truist Bank\n \nMoody’s\nS&P\nFitch\nDBRS Morningstar\nTruist Financial Corporation:\nIssuer\nBaa1\nA- / A-2\nA / F1\nAAL / R-1M\nSenior unsecured\nBaa1\nA-\nA-\nAAL\nSubordinated\nBaa1\nBBB+\nBBB+\nAH\nPreferred stock\nBaa3(hyb)\nBBB-\nBBB-\nAL\nTruist Bank:\nIssuer\nA3\nA / A-1\nA / F1\nAA / R-1H\nSenior unsecured\nA3\nA\nA\nAA\nDeposits\nA1 / P-1\nNA\nA+ / F1\nAA\nSubordinated\n(P) A3\nA-\nA-\nAAL\nRatings outlook:\nCredit trend\nStable\nStable\nStable\nStable\n74   Truist Financial Corporation\nCapital\nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist’s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist’s risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist, for the Parent Company to remain a source of strength for the Parent Company’s subsidiaries, and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.\nManagement regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management’s objective is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital limits, which are above the regulatory “well-capitalized” minimums. Truist also regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company’s capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management has implemented internal stress capital ratio minimums\n \nthat serve as limits which are measured under internally-developed stress testing scenarios to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated under hypothetical stress, and after the effect of alternative capital actions, are likely to remain above internal stressed minimums. Breaches of internal capital limits or projected breaches of internal stress capital ratio minimums under hypothetical stress result in the activation of Truist’s capital contingency plan.\nTable 23: Capital Requirements\n \nMinimum Capital\nWell-Capitalized\nMinimum Capital Plus Stress Capital Buffer\n(1)\n \nTruist\nTruist Bank\nCET1\n4.5 \n%\nNA\n6.5 \n%\n7.3 \n%\nTier 1 capital\n6.0 \n6.0 \n%\n8.0 \n8.8 \nTotal capital\n8.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n10.8 \nLeverage ratio\n4.0 \nNA\n5.0 \nNA\nSupplementary leverage ratio\n3.0 \nNA\nNA\nNA\n(1)\nReflects Truist’s SCB requirement, received in the 2024 CCAR process, of 2.8% applicable from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.

The plan provides a framework designed to monitor for the occurrence of these events by establishing mechanisms to detect capital contraction, including market and economic stress that could adversely impact the Company’s capital position. The plan also establishes governance protocols for activation or deactivation and decision making, lists capital contingency options and associated key information, and addresses the responsibilities of key departments.\nCapital ratios remained strong compared to the regulatory requirements for well capitalized banks. Truist’s CET1 ratio was 11.0% as of September 30, 2025, flat compared to June 30, 2025 as capital returned to shareholders and an increase in risk-weighted assets was offset by current quarter earnings.\nTruist declared common dividends of $0.52 per share during the third quarter of 2025 and repurchased $500 million of common stock. For the third quarter of 2025, the dividend payout ratio was 50%, and the total payout ratio was 87%.\nTruist Financial Corporation   75\nTruist completed the 2025 CCAR process and received a SCB requirement of 2.5% for the period October 1, 2025 to September 30, 2026, down 30 basis points from the SCB requirement for the period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.\nShare Repurchase Activity\nTable 25: Share Repurchase Activity\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data, shares in thousands)\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased\n(1)\nAverage Price Paid Per Share\n(2)(3)\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased as part of Publicly Announced Plans\nApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that may yet be Purchased Under the Plans\n(3)(4)\nJuly 1, 2025 to July 31, 2025\n11,099 \n$\n45.05 \n11,099 \n$\n2,250 \nAugust 1, 2025 to August 31, 2025\n— \n— \n— \n2,250 \nSeptember 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025\n— \n— \n— \n2,250 \nTotal\n11,099 \n$\n45.05 \n11,099 \n(1)\nIncludes shares exchanged or surrendered in connection with the exercise of equity-based awards under equity-based compensation plans.\n(2)\nExcludes commissions.\n(3)\nExcludes excise taxes on share repurchases.\n(4)\nIn June 2024, Truist announced that the Board had authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through 2026 as part of Truist’s overall capital distribution strategy. Repurchased shares revert to the status of authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase. The share-repurchase program enables Truist to acquire shares through open-market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans and other programs, at the discretion of management and on terms (including quantity, timing, and price) that management determines to be advisable. Actions in connection with the share-repurchase program will be subject to various factors, including Truist's capital and liquidity positions and related internal frameworks, accounting and regulatory considerations (including any restrictions that may be imposed by the FRB and any changes to capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements that may be proposed or adopted by the U.S. banking agencies), Truist's financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, the trading price of Truist's common stock, and general market conditions. The share-repurchase program does not obligate Truist to acquire a specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be extended, modified, or discontinued at any time.\nRegulatory and Supervisory Update\nWe are subject to significant regulatory frameworks that affect the products and services that we may offer and the manner in which we may offer them, the risks that we may take, the ways in which we may operate, and the corporate and financial actions that we may take.\nThe description below summarizes an update to the regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to Truist since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. This update does not summarize all actual, proposed, or possible changes in statutes, regulations, and other laws applicable to Truist and is not intended to be a substitute for those laws. Refer to “Regulatory and Supervisory Considerations” in Truist’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for additional disclosures.\nIn December 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule to financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets to either limit the cost of overdraft services to the amount of their costs and losses or adhere to a fee cap of $5. The rule was expected to take effect on October 1, 2025. In May 2025, the President signed a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn this rule. As a result, the rule will not become effective and banks with more than $10 billion in assets, including Truist Bank, will not be required to change their overdraft fee structures to comply with the rule.\n76   Truist Financial Corporation\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Truist are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist’s financial position and results of operations are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations, and related disclosures. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the ACL; determination of fair value for securities, MSRs, trading assets and liabilities, and derivative assets and liabilities; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; and pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Understanding Truist’s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD&A in Truist’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in “Note 1. Basis of Presentation” in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in “Note 1. Basis of Presentation” in this report. There have been no other changes to the critical accounting policies during 2025.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company’s three reporting units with goodwill balances are CSBB, WB, and Wealth. The Company performs goodwill impairment analysis annually as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value.\nThe quantitative valuations of these reporting units use the income approach and a market-based approach, each weighted at 50%. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of multi-year financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and required capital. The market-based approach utilizes comparable public company information, key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable.\nTruist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of expected acquirer expense synergies, historic bank control premiums, and the current market.\nThe projection of net interest margin and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the CSBB, WB, and Wealth reporting units. The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3% as of October 1, 2024, based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit. Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. The discount rates utilized for the CSBB, Wealth, and WB reporting units as of October 1, 2024 were 12.5%, 12.0%, and 10.5%, respectively.\nBased on the results of the Company’s annual impairment analyses, the Company concluded that the fair values of the CSBB, WB and Wealth reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values; therefore, there was no goodwill impairment. However, for the WB reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%, indicating that the goodwill of the WB reporting unit may remain at risk of impairment. Circumstances that could negatively impact the fair value for the WB reporting unit in the future include a sustained decrease in Truist’s stock price, a decline in industry peer multiples, an increase in the applicable discount rate, and deterioration in the reporting unit’s forecast.\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in management’s estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. The valuation of the WB reporting unit as of October 1, 2024 indicated that if the discount rate were increased more than 100 basis points, with other cash flow assumptions unchanged, the reporting unit’s fair value would be less than its carrying value, indicating a goodwill impairment under the income approach. Ultimately, future potential changes in management’s assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting unit’s carrying value could change based on market conditions, change in the underlying makeup of the reporting unit, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value.\nTruist Financial Corporation   77\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances during the period from January 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, Truist specific performance indicators, a comparison of management’s forecast and assumptions to those used in its October 1, 2024 quantitative impairment test, and the sensitivity of the October 1, 2024 quantitative results to changes in assumptions as of September 30, 2025. Based on these considerations, Truist concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of September 30, 2025."
