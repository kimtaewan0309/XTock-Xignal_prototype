The Company is focused on deploying its capital toward businesses that provide opportunities for above-market growth, strong returns, and align with secular trends and its power management strategies. During 2024 and 2025, Eaton continued to selectively add businesses to strengthen its portfolio.\nAcquisitions of businesses and investments in associate companies\nDate of acquisition\nBusiness segment\nExertherm\nMay 20, 2024\nElectrical Americas\nA U.K. based provider of thermal monitoring solutions for electrical equipment.\nNordicEPOD AS\nMay 31, 2024\nElectrical Global\nA 49 percent stake in NordicEPOD AS, which designs and assembles standardized power modules for data centers in the Nordic region.\nFibrebond Corporation\nApril 1, 2025\nElectrical Americas\nA U.S. based designer and builder of pre-integrated modular power enclosures for data center, industrial, utility and communications customers. \nResilient Power Systems, Inc.\nAugust 6, 2025\nElectrical Americas\nA leading North American developer and manufacturer of innovative energy solutions, including solid-state transformer-based technology.\nOn June 16, 2025, Eaton signed an agreement to acquire Ultra PCS Limited (Ultra PCS), which is headquartered in the U.K. with operations in the U.K. and the U.S. Ultra PCS produces electronic controls, sensing, stores ejection and data processing solutions, enabling mission success for global aerospace customers in the air and on the ground.

These financial measures include adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Consolidated Financial Results table below. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they provide additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our business performance and trends, and they allow investors to more easily compare Eaton’s financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton. \nAcquisition and Divestiture Charges\nEaton incurs integration charges and transaction costs to acquire and integrate businesses, and transaction, separation and other costs to divest and exit businesses. Eaton also recognizes gains and losses on the sale of businesses. A summary of these Corporate items is as follows:\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\n(In millions except for per share data)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nAcquisition integration, divestiture charges and transaction costs (income)\n$\n55 \n$\n(4)\n$\n135 \n$\n23 \nIncome tax benefit\n11 \n— \n30 \n7 \nTotal charges (income) after income taxes\n$\n44 \n$\n(4)\n$\n105 \n$\n17 \nPer ordinary share - diluted\n$\n0.11 \n$\n(0.01)\n$\n0.27 \n$\n0.04 \nAcquisition integration, divestiture charges and transaction costs in 2025 are primarily related to the following:\n•\nThe acquisitions of Fibrebond and Exertherm, transactions completed prior to 2023, and other charges to acquire and exit businesses.\n•\nEmployee transaction and retention award compensation expense related to the acquisition of Fibrebond of $16 million and $64 million \nin the \nthird\n quarter and first nine months of \n2025, respectively.\n•\nEmployee incentive compensation expense related to the acquisition of Resilient of $4 million in the third quarter of 2025. \nAcquisition integration, divestiture charges and transaction costs in 2024 are primarily related to acquisitions completed prior to 2023, and include other charges and income to acquire and exit businesses. \nCharges in 2025 and 2024 were included in Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense, Research and development expense, or Other expense (income) - net. In Business Segment Information in Note 16, the charges were included in Other expense - net.\nRestructuring Programs\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Eaton implemented a multi-year restructuring program to accelerate opportunities to optimize its operations and global support structure. These actions will better align the Company's functions to support anticipated growth and drive greater effectiveness throughout the Company. Since the inception of the program, the Company has incurred charges of $300 million. This restructuring program is expected to be completed in 2026 and is expected to incur additional expenses related to workforce reductions of $118 million and plant closing and other costs of $57 million, resulting in total estimated charges of $475 million for the entire program. The Company expects mature year benefits of $375 million when the multi-year program is fully implemented. \nAdditional information related to these restructuring programs is presented in Note 15. \n30\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Asset Amortization Expense\nIntangible asset amortization expense is as follows:\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\n(In millions except for per share data)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIntangible asset amortization expense\n$\n130 \n$\n106 \n$\n365 \n$\n319 \nIncome tax benefit\n28 \n23 \n77 \n68 \nTotal after income taxes\n$\n102 \n$\n84 \n$\n287 \n$\n251 \nPer ordinary share - diluted\n$\n0.26 \n$\n0.21 \n$\n0.74 \n$\n0.62 \nConsolidated Financial Results\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\nIncrease (decrease)\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\nIncrease (decrease)\n(In millions except for per share data)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n6,988 \n$\n6,345 \n10 \n%\n$\n20,393 \n$\n18,638 \n9 \n%\nGross profit\n2,675 \n2,446 \n9 \n%\n7,719 \n7,074 \n9 \n%\nPercent of net sales\n38.3 \n%\n38.6 \n%\n \n37.9 \n%\n38.0 \n%\nIncome before income taxes\n1,275 \n1,204 \n6 \n%\n3,637 \n3,399 \n7 \n%\nNet income\n1,010 \n1,011 \n— \n%\n2,958 \n2,827 \n5 \n%\nLess net income for noncontrolling interests\n(1)\n(1)\n \n(3)\n(4)\nNet income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders\n1,010 \n1,009 \n— \n%\n2,955 \n2,823 \n5 \n%\nExcluding acquisition and divestiture charges (income), after-tax\n44 \n(4)\n \n105 \n17 \nExcluding restructuring program charges, after-tax\n43 \n43 \n75 \n104 \nExcluding intangible asset amortization expense, after-tax\n102 \n84 \n287 \n251 \nAdjusted earnings\n$\n1,199 \n$\n1,132 \n6 \n%\n$\n3,423 \n$\n3,194 \n7 \n%\nNet income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders - diluted\n$\n2.59 \n$\n2.53 \n2 \n%\n$\n7.54 \n$\n7.05 \n7 \n%\nExcluding per share impact of acquisition and divestiture charges (income), after-tax\n0.11 \n(0.01)\n \n0.27 \n0.04 \nExcluding per share impact of restructuring program charges, after-tax\n0.11 \n0.11 \n0.19 \n0.26 \nExcluding per share impact of intangible asset amortization expense, after-tax\n0.26 \n0.21 \n0.74 \n0.62 \nAdjusted earnings per ordinary share\n$\n3.07 \n$\n2.84 \n8 \n%\n$\n8.74 \n$\n7.97 \n10 \n%\nNet Sales\nChanges in Net sales:\nThree months ended September 30, 2025\nNine months ended September 30, 2025\nOrganic growth\n7 \n%\n8 \n%\nAcquisitions of businesses\n3 \n%\n1 \n%\nTotal increase in Net sales\n10 \n%\n9 \n%\nThe increase in organic sales \nin the \nthird\n quarter of \n2025 was due to strength in data center end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, strength in machine OEM, residential, and commercial & institutional end-markets in the Electrical Global business segment, and broad based strength across all markets in the Aerospace business segment, partially offset by weakness in industrial end-markets in the Electrical Americas business segment, weakness in utility end-markets in the Electrical Global business segment, weakness in the North American truck and light vehicle markets in the Vehicle business segment, and weakness in the European region in the eMobility business segment.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in organic sales \nin the first \nnine\n months of \n2025 was due to strength in data center end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, strength in machine OEM and residential end-markets in the Electrical Global business segment, and strength in military aftermarket and commercial aftermarket in the Aerospace business segment, partially offset by weakness in industrial end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, weakness in the North American truck and light vehicle markets in the Vehicle business segment, and weakness in the North American and European regions in the eMobility business segment.\nGross Profit\nGross profit margin decreased from 38.6% in the third quarter of 2024 to 38.3% in the third quarter of 2025. Material factors affecting this decrease were a 340 basis point decline from higher commodity and wage inflation and a 30 basis point decline from higher intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by a 240 basis point increase from higher sales and a 130 basis point increase from operating efficiencies. \nGross profit margin decreased from 38.0% in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2024 to 37.9% in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2025. Material factors affecting this decrease were a 260 basis point decline from higher wage and commodity inflation, a 20 basis point decline from higher intangible asset amortization expense, and a 20 basis point decline from higher acquisition and divestiture charges, partially offset by a 230 basis point increase from higher sales and a 40 basis point increase from operating efficiencies.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was expense of 20.7% compared to expense of 16.1% for the third quarter of 2024. The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was expense of 18.7% compared to expense of 16.8% for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 was primarily due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions and the fact that the effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 included a reduction in valuation allowances on foreign tax attributes.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\") was enacted into law in the United States. The OBBBA extends and modifies certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and has multiple effective dates, with some provisions beginning in 2025. The OBBBA did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of 2025. The Company will continue to assess the impact of OBBBA and does not expect the OBBBA to have a material impact on its effective tax rate in future periods.\nNet Income\nChanges in Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders and Net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders - diluted are summarized as follows:\nThree months ended\nNine months ended\n(In millions except for per share data)\nDollars\nPer share\nDollars\nPer share\nSeptember 30, 2024\n$\n1,009 \n$\n2.53 \n$\n2,823 \n$\n7.05 \n  Business segment results of operations\n    Operational performance\n170 \n0.45 \n425 \n1.09 \n    Foreign currency\n1 \n— \n18 \n0.04 \n  Corporate\n    Intangible asset amortization expense\n(19)\n(0.05)\n(37)\n(0.12)\n    Restructuring program charges\n— \n— \n28 \n0.07 \n    Acquisition and divestiture charges\n(48)\n(0.12)\n(89)\n(0.23)\n    Other corporate items\n(42)\n(0.11)\n(144)\n(0.36)\n  Tax rate impact\n(63)\n(0.16)\n(70)\n(0.17)\n  Impact of shares\n— \n0.06 \n— \n0.17 \nSeptember 30, 2025\n$\n1,010 \n$\n2.59 \n$\n2,955 \n$\n7.54 \n32\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of Net sales, operating profit (loss) and operating margin by business segment.

Material factors affecting this decrease were a 340 basis point decline from higher commodity inflation, a 300 basis point decline from the sale of non-production facilities in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 230 basis point increase from operating efficiencies.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCorporate Expense\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\nIncrease (decrease)\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\nIncrease (decrease)\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIntangible asset amortization expense\n$\n130 \n$\n106 \n23 \n%\n$\n365 \n$\n319 \n14 \n%\nInterest expense - net\n67 \n29 \n131 \n%\n171 \n88 \n94 \n%\nPension and other postretirement benefits income\n(4)\n(9)\n(56)\n%\n(15)\n(29)\n(48)\n%\nRestructuring program charges\n55 \n54 \n2 \n%\n97 \n132 \n(27)\n%\nOther expense - net\n226 \n160 \n41 \n%\n698 \n508 \n37 \n%\nTotal corporate expense\n$\n474 \n$\n340 \n39 \n%\n$\n1,316 \n$\n1,018 \n29 \n%\nTotal corporate expense increased from $340 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $474 million in the third quarter of 2025 and from $1,018 million in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2024 to $1,316 million in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2025. Material factors affecting the increase in Total corporate expense in the third quarter \nand first \nnine\n months\n of 2025 were higher Other expense - net, Interest expense - net, and Intangible asset amortization expense. The increase in Other expense - net is primarily due to higher acquisition and divestiture costs. \n37\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nEaton’s objective is to finance its business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of equity and long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying its debt maturity structure, Eaton reduces liquidity risk.\nOn September 29, 2025, a subsidiary of Eaton entered into a new $3,000 million five-year revolving credit agreement that will expire on September 27, 2030 (New Revolving Credit Agreement), which replaced the $500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement dated September 30, 2024 and $2,500 million five-year revolving credit agreement dated October 3, 2022. The New Revolving Credit Agreement is used to support commercial paper borrowings and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis. There were no borrowings outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Agreement at September 30, 2025. The Company maintains access to the commercial paper markets through its $3,000 million commercial paper program, of which $755 million was outstanding on September 30, 2025, used primarily to manage fluctuations in working capital. \nOn May 9, 2025, a subsidiary of Eaton issued Euro denominated notes (2025 Euro Notes) with a face amount of €500 million ($564 million). The 2025 Euro Notes mature in 2035 with interest payable annually at a rate of 3.625% per annum. The issuer received proceeds totaling €494 million ($558 million) from the 2025 Euro Notes issuance, net of financing costs and discounts. The 2025 Euro Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The 2025 Euro Notes contain customary optional redemption and par call provisions. The 2025 Euro Notes also contain a change of control provision which requires the Company to make an offer to purchase all or any part of the 2025 Euro Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The capitalized deferred financing fees are amortized in Interest expense - net over the term of the 2025 Euro Notes. The 2025 Euro Notes are subject to customary non-financial covenants.\nAlso on May 9, 2025, the same subsidiary of Eaton issued senior notes (2025 Notes) with a face amount of $500 million. The 2025 Notes mature in 2030 with interest payable semi-annually at a rate of 4.45% per annum. The issuer received proceeds totaling $495 million from the 2025 Notes issuance, net of financing costs and discounts. The 2025 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The 2025 Notes contain customary optional redemption and par call provisions. The 2025 Notes also contain a change of control provision which requires the Company to make an offer to purchase all or any part of the 2025 Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The capitalized deferred financing fees are amortized in Interest expense - net over the term of the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are subject to customary non-financial covenants.\nOver the course of a year, cash, short-term investments, and short-term debt may fluctuate in order to manage global liquidity. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Eaton had cash of $328 million and $555 million, short-term investments of $237 million and $1,525 million, respectively, with $761 million short-term debt as of September 30, 2025 and no short-term debt as of December 31, 2024. Eaton believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, cash and short-term investment balances, availability under existing revolving credit facilities, and access to capital markets in excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business, fund capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, as well as scheduled payments of long-term debt.\nOn April 1, 2025, the Company paid $1.45 billion, net of cash acquired, to acquire Fibrebond Corporation. On August 6, 2025, the Company acquired Resilient Power Systems Inc. for $86 million, including $55 million of cash paid at closing and an initial estimate of $31 million for the fair value of contingent future consideration. In addition, the Company expects to close the acquisitions of Ultra PCS and Boyd Thermal in the fourth quarter of 2025 and second quarter of 2026, respectively, for $1.55 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively.\nEaton was in compliance with each of its debt covenants for all periods presented.\n38\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nA summary of cash flows is as follows:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\nChange \nfrom 2024\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,507 \n$\n2,730 \n$\n(223)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(783)\n— \n(783)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(1,812)\n(2,692)\n880 \nEffect of currency on cash\n(138)\n(52)\n(86)\nTotal decrease in cash\n$\n(227)\n$\n(14)\nOperating Cash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $223 million in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2025 compared to 2024. Material factors affecting this decrease were working capital balances being $656 million higher, partially offset by higher net income of $131 million.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $783 million in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2025 compared to 2024. Material factors affecting this increase were an increase in cash paid for business acquisitions of $1,504 million in 2025 compared to $50 million in 2024, partially offset by sales of short-term investments of $1,287 million in 2025 compared to $595 million in 2024.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $880 million in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2025 compared to 2024. Material factors affecting this decrease were net proceeds of short-term debt of $761 million in 2025 compared to net payments of short-term debt of $6 million in 2024, and a decrease in payments on borrowings to $714 million in 2025 from $1,011 million in 2024, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid to $1,222 million in 2025 from $1,130 million in 2024 and an increase in repurchase of shares to $1,669 million in 2025 from $1,615 million in 2024.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $527 million and $553 million in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company plans to increase capital expenditures over the next several years to expand production capacity across various markets to support anticipated growth. As a result, Eaton expects approximately $900 million in capital expenditures in 2025. \nDividends\nCash dividend payments were $1,222 million and $1,130 million in the \nfirst \nnine\n months\n of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Payment of quarterly dividends in the future depends upon the Company’s ability to generate net income and operating cash flows, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by the Eaton Board of Directors. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2025.\n39\nTable of Contents\nShare Repurchases\nOn February 23, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program for repurchases of ordinary shares up to $5.0 billion to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2022 Program). On February 27, 2025, the Board of Directors renewed the 2022 Program by providing authority for up to $9.0 billion in repurchases to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2025 Program). Under the 2025 Program, the ordinary shares are expected to be repurchased over time, depending on market conditions, the market price of ordinary shares, capital levels, and other considerations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, 1.0 million and 5.2 million ordinary shares, respectively, were repurchased under the 2025 or 2022 Programs in the open market at a total cost of $355 million and $1,661 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 3.0 million and 5.3 million ordinary shares, respectively, were repurchased under the 2022 program in the open market at a total cost of $891 million and $1,629 million, respectively.\nAcquisition of Businesses and Investments in Associate Companies\nThe Company paid cash of $1,504 million and $50 million in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively, to acquire businesses. The Company paid cash of $16 million and $68 million in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively, for investments in associate companies. The Company will continue to focus on deploying its capital toward businesses that provide opportunities for higher growth and strong returns, and align with secular trends and its power management strategies. \nDebt\nThe Company manages a number of short-term and long-term debt instruments, including commercial paper. At September 30, 2025, the Company had Short-term debt of $761 million, Current portion of long-term debt of $1,136 million, and Long-term debt of $8,756 million. The Company believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, and access to capital markets to meet scheduled payments of long-term debt.\nSupply Chain Finance Program\nA third-party financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program that enables certain of the Company’s suppliers, at the supplier’s sole discretion, to sell receivables due from the Company to the financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution. The SCF program does not have a significant impact on the Company’s liquidity as payments by the Company to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. For additional information on the SCF program, see Note 7. \n40\nTable of Contents\nGuaranteed Debt\nIssuers, Guarantors and Guarantor Structure    \nEaton Corporation has issued senior notes pursuant to indentures dated April 1, 1994 (the 1994 Indenture), November 20, 2012 (the 2012 Indenture), September 15, 2017 (the 2017 Indenture), and August 23, 2022 (as supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures of the same date and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated May 18, 2023, the 2022 Indenture). Eaton Capital Unlimited Company, a subsidiary of Eaton, is the issuer of four outstanding series of debt securities sold in offshore transactions under Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act (the Eurobonds) and Registered Senior Notes (as defined below) issued under an indenture dated May 9, 2025 (as supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures of the same date, the 2025 Indenture). The senior notes issued under the 1994, 2012, 2017, 2022, and 2025 Indentures are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Registered Senior Notes). The Eurobonds and the Registered Senior Notes (together, the Senior Notes) comprise substantially all of Eaton’s long-term indebtedness.\nSubstantially all of the Senior Notes (with limited exceptions), together with the credit facilities described above under Liquidity and Financial Condition (the Credit Facilities), are guaranteed by Eaton and 17 of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, they rank equally with each other. However, because these obligations are not secured, they would be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness of Eaton and its subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2025, Eaton has no material, long-term secured debt. The guaranteed Registered Senior Notes are also structurally subordinated to the liabilities of Eaton's subsidiaries that are not guarantors. Except as described below under Future Guarantors, Eaton is not obligated to cause its subsidiaries to guarantee the Registered Senior Notes. \nThe table set forth in Exhibit 22 filed with the Form 10-Q filed on August 5, 2025 (10-Q Exhibit 22) details the primary obligors and guarantors with respect to the guaranteed Registered Senior Notes.\nTerms of Guarantees of Registered Securities\nPayment of principal and interest on the Registered Senior Notes is guaranteed, on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis by the subsidiaries of Eaton set forth in the table referenced in the 10-Q Exhibit 22. Each guarantee is full and unconditional, and joint and several. Each guarantor’s guarantee is an unsecured obligation that ranks equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes are subject to a customary savings clause or similar provision designed to prevent such guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or otherwise legally impermissible or voidable obligation.\nThough the terms of the indentures vary slightly, generally, each guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes by a guarantor that is a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation provides that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to:\n(a)\nthe consummation of certain types of transactions permitted under the applicable indenture, including one that results in such guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; and \n(b)\nfor Registered Senior Notes issued under the 2022 and 2025 Indentures, when such guarantor is a guarantor or issuer of indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of less than 25% of our total outstanding indebtedness.\nFurther, each guarantee by a direct or indirect parent of Eaton Corporation (other than Eaton) provides that it will also be released if:\n(c)\nsuch guarantee (so long as the guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligations), becomes prohibited by any applicable law, rule or regulation or by any contractual obligation; or \n(d)\nsuch guarantee results in material adverse tax consequences to Eaton or any of its subsidiaries (so long as the applicable guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligation).\nThe guarantee of Eaton does not contain any release provisions.\nFuture Guarantors\nThe 2012 and 2017 Indentures generally provide that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under any series of debt securities or a syndicated credit facility. Further, the 2012 and 2017 Indentures provide that any entity that becomes a direct or indirect parent entity of Eaton Corporation and holds any material assets, with certain limited exceptions, or owes any material liabilities must become a guarantor. The 2022 and 2025 Indentures provide only that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of 25% of the Parent and its Subsidiaries’ then-outstanding indebtedness.\nThe 1994 Indenture does not contain provisions with respect to future guarantors.\n41\nTable of Contents\nSummarized Financial Information of Guarantors and Issuers\n(In millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nCurrent assets\n$\n4,307 \n$\n5,027 \nNoncurrent assets\n13,225 \n13,225 \nCurrent liabilities\n5,119 \n3,738 \nNoncurrent liabilities\n10,749 \n10,564 \nAmounts due to subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors - net\n9,670 \n10,334 \n(In millions)\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nNet sales\n$\n12,087 \nSales to subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors\n725 \nCost of products sold\n8,458 \nExpense from subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors - net\n593 \nNet income\n900 \nThe financial information presented is that of the issuers and the guarantors, which includes Eaton Corporation plc, on a combined basis and the financial information of non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries has been excluded.
