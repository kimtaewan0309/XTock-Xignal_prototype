Incorporated in 1997, our three core strengths include deep system-level knowledge, strong semiconductor design expertise, and innovative proprietary technologies in the areas of semiconductor processes, system integration, and packaging. These combined advantages enable us to deliver reliable, compact, and monolithic solutions found in storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications. Our mission is to reduce energy and material consumption to improve all aspects of quality of life and create a sustainable future. We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur principal executive office is located in Kirkland, Washington. We have over 4,000 employees worldwide, with various locations in Asia, Europe and the U.S.\n\n\n \n\n\nIndustry Overview\n\n\n \n\n\nSemiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment. Within the semiconductor industry, components can be classified either as discrete devices, such as individual transistors, or integrated circuits (“ICs”), in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit. ICs can be further divided into three primary categories: digital, analog, and mixed-signal. Digital ICs, such as memory devices and microprocessors, can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes. Analog ICs, in contrast, handle real world signals such as temperature, pressure, light, sound, or speed. In addition, analog ICs also perform power management functions, such as regulating or converting voltages, for electronic devices. Mixed-signal ICs combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world applications to digital systems.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe focus on the market for high performance analog and mixed-signal ICs. High performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors, which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip, greater precision, better power efficiency and density, higher speed and lower heat and noise. There are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixed-signal IC markets from digital IC markets. These factors include longer product life cycles, numerous market segments, technology that is difficult to replicate, relative complexity of design and process technologies, importance of experienced design engineers, lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets. We have targeted product and market areas that we believe allow us to operate at above-average growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole.\n\n\n \n\n\nEnd Markets and Applications\n\n\n \n\n\nWe design and develop our products for the enterprise data, storage and computing, automotive, communications, consumer, and industrial end markets. Enterprise data was our largest end market in 2024. The following table is a summary of the various key end market applications for our products, and those markets’ contribution as a percentage of our total revenue:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPercentage of Total Revenue\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEnd Markets\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nApplications\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2024\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2023\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2022\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEnterprise Data\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nCloud-based and on-premises CPU server and workstation applications, and server artificial intelligence (“AI”) applications\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n17.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n14.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStorage and computing\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nStorage applications, notebooks, and graphics cards\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n27.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n25.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAutomotive\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nAdvanced driver assistance systems, infotainment, USB connectors, body electronics, motion control and lighting systems\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n21.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n16.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCommunications\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nNetwork infrastructure, satellite communications, optical modules, and other wireless applications\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n11.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n14.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nConsumer\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nHome appliances, gaming, smart TVs, lighting, monitors, and stereos\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n12.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n17.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIndustrial\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPower sources, industrial meter, security applications, and other industrial equipment\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n9.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n12.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n    5\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProduct Families\n  \n Our proprietary process and packaging technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller, single-chip power management ICs. These technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer end markets. Our key product families include, but not limited to, the Direct Current (“DC”) to DC, Alternating Current (“AC”) to DC, driver metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, power management IC, current limit switch and lighting control products. Our product families are differentiated from those of our competitors with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy, power efficiency, quality and longevity, making them cost-effective and more sustainable relative to many competing solutions. For example, DC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as cloud-based and on-premises CPU servers and workstation applications, server AI applications, storage applications, notebooks, infotainment, power sources, home appliances, network infrastructure and satellite communications applications. We believe our DC to DC products are differentiated in the market, particularly with respect to their high degree of integration, high voltage operation, high load current, high switching speed, small footprint, and high energy efficiency. These features are important to our customers as they are designed to result in fewer components that need to be produced and consumed, a smaller form factor, more accurate regulation of voltages, lower power consumption and, ultimately, lower system cost, increased reliability and lower carbon emissions through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices.\n   \n In the future, we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to innovate while fulfilling our customers’ evolving needs, enter new market segments, obtain design wins, grow our sales in a diversified way across regions, expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.\n\n\n \n\n\nCustomers, Sales and Marketing\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have sales offices in various locations in Asia, Europe and the U.S. Our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application. We maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products.\n\n\n \n\n\nOnce we secure our product positioning through our technical sales and applications engineers’ efforts, we then sell our products through third-party distributors and value-added resellers. In addition, we sell directly to certain original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and end customers. Our third-party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us, which allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers, including OEMs and ODMs. Our value-added resellers may second source other products and provide other services to customers. ODMs typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of OEMs.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn 2024, our two largest distributors accounted for 31% and 20% of our total revenue. In 2023, our three largest distributors accounted for 26%, 19% and 10% of our total revenue. In 2022, our two largest distributors accounted for 24% and 19% of our total revenue. No other direct customers accounted for more than 10% of our full-year, total revenue in any of the periods presented. Our revenue from indirect sales to one customer, which primarily comprised power management solutions for AI applications, was 17% of our total revenue in 2024. Our revenue from indirect sales to this customer was below 10% in both 2023 and 2022.\n\n\n \n\n\nCurrent distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the non-exclusive right to sell and shall use its best efforts to promote and develop our products in various markets. These agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 90 days from the date of invoice. In addition, we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements.\n\n\n \n\n\nBecause our sales are primarily billed and payable in U.S. dollars, our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates. However, because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in Asia, changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 94%, 87% and 86%, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped. Because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement, and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period, we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue. \n\n\n \n\n\nTypical supply chain lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks. We often build inventory in advance based on our forecast of future customer orders. This subjects us to certain risks, most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast, which could lead to inventories in excess of demand. If excess inventory exists, it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount, take a significant write-down or dispose of it altogether, all of which would negatively affect our profit margins. In addition, in response to market conditions, we may slow the rate of manufacturing our products, which could result in insufficient inventory levels and reduced sales if we underestimate the demand for our products.\n\n\n \n\n\nResearch and Development\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have assembled a qualified team of engineers in various locations in Asia, Europe and the U.S. with core competencies in analog and mixed-signal design. Through our research and development efforts, we have developed a collection of intellectual property and know-how that we are able to leverage across our products and markets. These include the development of high efficiency power devices, the design of precision analog circuits and systems, expertise in mixed-signal design, packaging and solution development, integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas: systems architecture, circuit design and implementation, and process technologies. In the area of systems architecture, we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities. In the area of circuit design and implementation, our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products. In the area of process technologies, we are investing in research and development resources to provide leading-edge analog power processes for our next generation of ICs. We believe process technologies are key strategic components to our future growth. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      6\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur growth is fueled by our customers’ need for our power-efficient solutions. Consequently, we focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products in our research and development efforts in all three targeted areas. Our products are principally positioned to achieve lower power loss and enable significant reductions in circuit board space by shrinking or eliminating many passive components that are otherwise needed by competitors’ offerings. In addition, the life cycles of our products are typically over 10 years, reducing the manufacturing needs and associated carbon emissions associated with the production of replacement products.\n\n\n \n\n\nPatents and Intellectual Property Matters\n\n\n \n\n\nWe rely on our proprietary technologies, which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn general, we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,917 patents/applications issued or pending, of which 608 patents have been issued in the U.S. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through December 2044. Our patents are material to our business, but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success. We also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. We also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate. We have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business. Despite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. There can be no assurance that the steps we take are adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the U.S. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims. Such litigation can be very costly and may divert our management resources. Further, we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products. In the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers, we could be enjoined from selling selected products, could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers, or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties. If any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms, we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\n \n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\n \n\n\nWe utilize a fabless business model, working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ICs. This fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures. In contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies, which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners, we have developed our own proprietary process and packaging technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use on our behalf. This close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ICs.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe currently contract with several suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. Once our silicon wafers have been produced, they are shipped to the facilities in China, Taiwan, and Singapore that we and our partners utilize for wafer sort, which is a testing process performed to identify non-functioning dies. Our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in China, Taiwan and Malaysia. The assembled ICs are then sent for final testing to the facilities in China, Taiwan and Malaysia that we and our partners utilize prior to shipping to our customers. Our strategy is to maintain a diversified supply chain.\n  \n The manufacturing facilities we utilize in Asia enable us to benefit from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs. We have expanded our product testing capabilities in these facilities and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nCompetition\n\n\n \n\n\nThe analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel, our ability to introduce new products, our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products, and our ability to meet our end customers’ energy efficiency goals. Our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the life of a product. We compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products. In some cases, our competitors have a broader number of product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with several manufacturers of such products. We consider our primary competitors to include Analog Devices, Infineon Technologies, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Power Integrations, Renesas Electronics, ROHM Semiconductor, Semtech, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      7\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market. We believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell, because our ICs typically are smaller in size, are highly integrated with lower energy consumption, and achieve higher performance specifications than most of our competitors. However, there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. In addition, there has historically been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. If these or future acquisitions are successful, competition may intensify, as our competitors add resources with which to compete against us.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry. While we are subject to industry downturns, we have targeted product and market areas that we believe allow us to operate at above average industry performance levels over the long term.\n\n\n \n\n\nHistorically, our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half although various factors, such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions, could impact this trend.\n\n\n \n\n\nGovernment Regulations\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to international, federal and local legislation, regulations, and other requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment; the treatment, transport, and disposal of hazardous wastes; recycling and product packaging; worker health and safety; and other activities affecting the environment, our workforce, and the management of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe and our supply chain, including the end products which contain our products, are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we, our supply chain or the providers of such end products, have operations or otherwise do business. Government regulations and import/export controls can be complex and are subject to change in the future, and in some cases unexpectedly, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Our efforts to comply with these government regulations could have material impacts on our capital expenditures, operating expenses, revenue, resource allocation, operations, competitive position, or financial condition, and the magnitude and duration of such impacts are uncertain and difficult to quantify. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of material risks related to government policies and regulations on environmental laws, international trade policies and restrictions, including tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting the export of goods and services between the U.S. and China.\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\n\n \n\n\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixed-signal ICs, our engineers generally have many years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude. Analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace. The loss of the services of key officers, managers, engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel, and there can be no assurance we will be successful.\n  \n As of December 31, 2024, we employed 4,017 employees in various locations in Asia, Europe and the U.S., compared with 3,564 employees as of December 31, 2023. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced an employee-based work stoppage or strike.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe strive to maintain a culture that encourages innovation and create a workplace that values diverse skill sets and experience, a healthy and safe environment, and professional growth opportunities.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n\n\n \nWe continue to recruit new talent from a diverse candidate pool through various university recruitment programs and employment websites targeting underrepresented groups. We provide unconscious bias training to promote an environment of inclusivity. We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind and have policies for reporting concerns or violations.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n\n\n \nWe are an equal-opportunity employer, and we make employment decisions based on merit and business needs. Our total compensation packages are competitive, fair, and structured to encourage employees to invest in our future.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n\n\n \nWe provide employees with access to various learning tools and resources to explore their interests and develop their business skills and knowledge.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n\n\n \nWe have occupational health and safety management systems and environmental management plans in place. They include our standards for chemical and hazardous waste management, rules on the use of personal protective equipment, and safety training plans. Our largest testing facilities in Chengdu, China are ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certified.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n\n\n \nWe support the well-being of our employees. In certain offices, we offer onsite flu shot clinics and other annual health checkups and workshops. Our largest facilities have amenities including fitness centers, sports courts and private rooms for nursing. We also offer free exercise classes, strength training and yoga in some of our offices.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      8\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAvailable Information\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports that are filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge.
