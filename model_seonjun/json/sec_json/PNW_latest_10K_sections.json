Additional information related to these subsidiaries is provided later in this report.\n \nOur reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities, and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.  Our reportable business segment activities are conducted primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS. \n \nBUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY\n \nAPS currently provides electric service to approximately 1.4 million customers.  We own or lease 6,540 MW of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both long-term and short-term purchased power agreements for additional capacity.  During 2024, no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 1.4% of our electric revenues.\n3\nTable of Contents\n The following map shows APS’s retail service territory, including the locations of its generating facilities and principal transmission lines.\n4\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Sources and Resource Planning \nTo serve its customers, APS obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements.  Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet Arizona’s future energy needs.  APS’s sources of energy by type used to supply energy to Native Load customers during 2024 were approximately as follows:\n*Utility Scale Renewables include energy from biogas, biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind. \nThe share of APS’s energy supply being derived from clean resources was approximately 54% in 2024, which includes energy from nuclear, renewables and DSM.  \nClean Energy Focus Initiatives\nIn response to climate change, APS has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce carbon, including renewable energy procurement and development, and promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation, renewable energy use, and energy efficiency.  See “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Current and Future Resources” below for details of these plans and initiatives.  APS currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources, including biogas, biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind.  In addition, in January 2020, APS announced its Clean Energy Commitment, a three-pronged approach aimed at ultimately eliminating carbon-emitting resources from its electric generation resource portfolio. \n5\nTable of Contents\nAPS’s Clean Energy Commitment consists of three parts: \n•\nA 2050 goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity;\n•\nA 2030 target to achieve a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and\n•\nA plan to exit from coal-fired generation by 2031.\nAmong other strategies, APS intends to achieve these goals through various methods such as relying on Palo Verde, one of the nation’s largest producers of carbon-free energy; increasing clean energy resources, including renewables; developing energy storage; exiting from coal-generated electricity; managing demand with a modern interactive grid; promoting customer technology and energy efficiency; and optimizing regional resources.  Management takes into consideration climate change and other environmental risks in its strategy development, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes.  See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about APS’s Clean Energy Commitment. \nOver this same period of time, APS also intends to harden its infrastructure in order to improve climate resiliency, which involves system and operational improvements aimed at reducing the impact of extreme weather events and other climate-related disruptions upon APS’s operations.  Among other resiliency strategies, APS anticipates increasing investments in a modern and more flexible electricity grid with advanced distribution technologies.  APS plans to continue its forest management programs aimed at reducing wildfires, as those risks become compounded by shorter, drier winters and longer, hotter summers as a result of climate change.\nAPS prepares an annual inventory of GHG emissions from its operations.  For APS’s operations involving fossil-fuel electricity generation and electricity transmission and distribution, APS’s annual GHG inventory is reported to the EPA under the EPA GHG Reporting Program.  In addition to reporting to the EPA, we publicly report Scope 1 and 2, as well as a limited number of Scope 3, GHG emissions.  This data is then communicated to the public in Pinnacle West’s annual Corporate Responsibility Report as performance data and in CDP Reports, which are available on our website (\nwww.pinnaclewest.com/corporate-responsibility\n).  The reports provide information related to the Company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance.  The information on Pinnacle West’s website, including Corporate Responsibility Reports and CDP Reports, is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report. \nGeneration Facilities\n \nAPS has ownership interests in or leases the nuclear, gas, oil, coal, and solar generating facilities as well as energy storage facilities described below.  For additional information regarding these facilities, see Item 2.\n \nNuclear\nPalo Verde Generating Station —\n Palo Verde is a 3-unit nuclear power plant located approximately 50 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona.  APS operates the plant and owns 29.1% of Palo Verde Units 1 and 3 and approximately 17% of Unit 2.  In addition, APS leases approximately 12.1% of Unit 2, resulting in a 29.1% combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit.  APS has a total entitlement from Palo Verde of 1,146 MW.\n \n6\nTable of Contents\nPalo Verde Leases —\n In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back approximately 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities.  The leaseback was originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2015 and contained options to renew the leases or to purchase the leased property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms.  On July 7, 2014, APS exercised the fixed rate lease renewal options.  The exercise of the renewal options originally resulted in APS retaining the assets through 2023 under one lease and 2033 under the other two leases.  On April 1, 2021, APS executed an amendment relating to the lease agreement with the term ending in 2023.  The amendment extends the lease term for this lease through 2033 and changes the lease payment.  As a result of this amendment, APS will now retain the assets through 2033 under all three lease agreements.  At the end of the lease renewal periods, APS will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value, extend the leases for up to two years, or return the assets to the lessors.  See Note 17 for additional information regarding the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback transactions.\n \nPalo Verde Operating Licenses\n — Operation of each of the three Palo Verde Units requires an operating license from the NRC.  The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June 1985, Unit 2 in April 1986, and Unit 3 in November 1987, and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in April 2011, which extended the licenses for Units 1, 2, and 3 to June 2045, April 2046, and November 2047, respectively.\n \nPalo Verde Fuel Cycle —\n The participant owners of Palo Verde are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs.  The fuel cycle for Palo Verde is comprised of the following stages:\n•\nMining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates;\n•\nConversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride;\n•\nEnrichment of uranium hexafluoride;\n•\nFabrication of fuel assemblies;\n•\nUtilization of fuel assemblies in reactors; and\n•\nStorage and preparation for disposal of spent nuclear fuel.\n    \nThe Palo Verde participants have contracted for 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2028 and 52% through 2029; 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for conversion services through 2030 and 32% through 2031; 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for enrichment services through 2028; and 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for fuel fabrication through 2027 for Unit 2 and Unit 1 and 2028 for Unit 3.\nSpent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal —\n The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (“NWPA”) required the DOE to begin to accept, transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998.  The DOE’s obligations are reflected in a contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (the “Standard Contract”) with each nuclear power plant.  The DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998.  The DOE had planned to meet its NWPA and Standard Contract disposal obligations by designing, licensing, constructing, and operating a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  In June 2008, the DOE submitted its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application to the NRC, but in March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application.  Several legal proceedings followed challenging DOE’s withdrawal of its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application and the NRC’s cessation of its review of the Yucca \n7\nTable of Contents\nMountain construction authorization application, which were consolidated into one matter at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the “D.C. Circuit”).  Following the D.C. Circuit’s August 2013 order, the NRC issued two volumes of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application.  Publication of these volumes does not signal whether or when the NRC might authorize construction of the repository.  APS is directly involved in legal proceedings related to the DOE’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.\n \nAPS Lawsuit for Breach of Standard Contract\n — In December 2003, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the Palo Verde participants, filed a lawsuit against the DOE in the United States Court of Federal Claims (“Court of Federal Claims”) for damages incurred due to the DOE’s breach of the Standard Contract.  The Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of APS and the Palo Verde participants in October 2010 and awarded damages to APS and the Palo Verde participants for costs incurred through December 2006.\n \nOn December 19, 2012, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of Palo Verde, filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the DOE in the United States Court of Federal Claims.  The lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to DOE’s breach of the Standard Contract for failing to accept Palo Verde’s spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2011, pursuant to the terms of the Standard Contract and the NWPA.  On August 18, 2014, APS and DOE entered into a settlement agreement, which required DOE to pay the Palo Verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by Palo Verde during the period January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2011.  In addition, the settlement agreement provided APS with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through December 31, 2016, which was extended to December 31, 2025. \nAPS has recovered costs for ten claims pursuant to the terms of the August 15, 2014 settlement agreement, for ten \nseparate time periods during July 1, 2011 through October 31, 2023.\n \nThe DOE has approved and paid\n \napproximately \n$156.7 million for these claims (APS’s share is \napproximately \n$45.6 million).  \nThe amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income.\n \nIn accordance with the 2017 Rate Case Decision, this regulatory liability is being refunded to customers. \n See Note 3.  On October 31, 2024, APS filed its eleventh claim pursuant to the terms of the August 15, 2014, settlement agreement in the amount of \napproximately \n$18 million (APS’s share is \napproximately \n$5.3 million).  In February 2025, the DOE approved \napproximately \n$17.6 million of this claim.\nWaste Confidence\n \nand Continued Storage\n — On June 8, 2012, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the NRC’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel.  The petitioners had challenged the NRC’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule (“Waste Confidence Decision”).  The D.C. Circuit found that the NRC’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient, and therefore remanded the Waste Confidence Decision update for further action consistent with National Environmental Policy Act.  In September 2013, the NRC issued its draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (“GEIS”) to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision.  On August 26, 2014, the NRC approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel.  Renamed as the Continued Storage Rule, the NRC’s decision adopted the findings of the GEIS regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations.  As a result, those generic impacts do not need to be re-analyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses.  The final Continued Storage Rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the NRC and the Court of Appeals.  In June 2016, the D.C. \n8\nTable of Contents\nCircuit issued its final decision, rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the Continued Storage Rule.  On August 8, 2016, the D.C. Circuit denied a petition for rehearing.\n    \nPalo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site independent spent fuel storage installation (“ISFSI”) to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period, which ends in December 2027.  Additionally, Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation, which ends in November 2047.  If uncertainties regarding the United States government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will evaluate expanding the ISFSI, or alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI, to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation.\n \nNuclear Decommissioning Costs\n — APS currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the NRC financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3.  The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently included in APS’s ACC jurisdictional rates.  Decommissioning costs are recoverable through a non-bypassable system benefits charge (paid by all retail customers taking service from the APS system).  Based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances, site specific decommissioning cost studies, anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts, and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility, we are on track to meet the current site-specific decommissioning costs for Palo Verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned.  See Note 18 for additional information about APS’s nuclear decommissioning trusts.\n \nPalo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters\n — See “Palo Verde Generating Station — Nuclear Insurance” in Note 10 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the Palo Verde participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.\n \nNatural Gas and Oil Fueled Generating Facilities\nAPS has six natural gas power plants located throughout Arizona, consisting of Redhawk, located near Palo Verde; Ocotillo, located in Tempe; Sundance, located in Coolidge; West Phoenix, located in southwest Phoenix; Saguaro, located north of Tucson; and Yucca, located near Yuma.  Several of the units at Yucca run on either gas or oil.  APS has two oil-only power plants: Douglas, located in the town of Douglas, Arizona and Yucca GT-4 in Yuma, Arizona.  APS owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oil-only combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at Yucca that are operated by APS and owned by the Imperial Irrigation District.  APS has a total entitlement from these plants of 3,573 MW.  A portion of the gas for these plants is financially hedged up to three years in advance of purchasing and that position is converted to a physical gas purchase one month prior to delivery.  APS has long-term gas transportation agreements with three different companies, some of which are effective through 2052.  Fuel oil is acquired under short-term purchases delivered by truck directly to the power plants.\nIn 2024, APS contracted for the addition of two combustion turbines (approximately 90 MW in total) at Sundance, which are expected to be in service in 2026, and the addition of eight combustion turbines (approximately 397 MW total) at Redhawk, which are expected to be in service in 2028. \n9\nTable of Contents\nCoal Fueled Generating Facilities\nFour Corners\n — Four Corners is located in the northwestern corner of New Mexico and was originally a 5-unit coal-fired power plant.  APS owns 100% of Units 1, 2 and 3, which were retired as of December 30, 2013.  APS operates the plant and owns 63% of Four Corners Units 4 and 5.  APS has a total entitlement from Four Corners of 970 MW.  APS plans to exit coal-fired generation as part of its portfolio of electricity generating resources, including Four Corners, by 2031.  \nNTEC, a company formed by the Navajo Nation to own the mine that serves Four Corners and develop other energy projects, is the coal supplier for Four Corners.  The Four Corners co-owners executed a long-term agreement for the supply of coal to Four Corners from July 2016 through 2031, which was amended and restated on July 1, 2024.\nAPS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the Navajo Nation, which extends the Four Corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041.  The Navajo Nation approved these amendments in March 2011.  The effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the DOI, as did a related federal rights-of-way grant.  A federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the DOI review process and culminated in the issuance by DOI of a record of decision on July 17, 2015, justifying the agency action to extend the life of the plant and the adjacent mine.    \nIn June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners as early as fall 2023.  In July 2024, APS and the owners amended the agreement to retain the option for seasonal operation.\n \nUnder seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons where electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter and spring.\n \nThe other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages.\n \nAs of the date of this report, APS has elected not to begin seasonal operation due to market conditions.\n              \nCholla\n — Cholla was originally a 4-unit coal-fired power plant, which is located in northeastern Arizona.  APS operates the plant and owns 100% of Cholla Units 1, 2 and 3.  PacifiCorp owns Cholla Unit 4, and APS operated that unit for PacifiCorp.  On September 11, 2014, APS announced that it would close Cholla Unit 2 and cease burning coal at the other APS-owned units (Units 1 and 3) at the plant by the mid-2020s, if EPA approved a compromise proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules.  On April 14, 2015, the ACC approved APS’s plan to retire Unit 2, without expressing any view on the future recoverability of APS’s remaining investment in the Unit.  APS closed Unit 2 on October 1, 2015.  Following the closure of Unit 2, APS has a total entitlement from Cholla of 380 MW.  In early 2017, EPA approved a final rule incorporating APS’s compromise proposal, which took effect for Cholla on April 26, 2017.  In December 2019, PacifiCorp notified APS that it planned to retire Cholla Unit 4 by the end of 2020 and the unit ceased operation in December 2020.  APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla units during 2025.\nAPS purchased all of Cholla coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines the coal under long-term leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders.  APS elected not to extend the coal and transportation agreements that expired on December 31, 2024, as Cholla operations are expected to conclude in 2025.\nNavajo Plant\n — The Navajo Plant was a 3-unit coal-fired power plant located in northern Arizona.  Salt River Project operated the plant and APS owned a 14% interest in Units 1, 2 and 3.  APS had a total \n10\nTable of Contents\nentitlement from the Navajo Plant of 315 MW.  The Navajo Plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government.  \nThe co-owners of the Navajo Plant and the Navajo Nation agreed that the Navajo Plant would remain in operation until December 2019 under the existing plant lease.  The co-owners and the Navajo Nation executed a lease extension on November 29, 2017, which allowed for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations in November 2019. \nAPS is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the Navajo Plant over its previously estimated life through 2026.  APS will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant.  See Note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure, which are still being assessed and which may be material.\nSee Note 10 for information regarding APS’s coal mine reclamation obligations related to these coal-fired plants.\nSolar Facilities\nAPS developed utility scale solar resources through the 180 MW ACC-approved AZ Sun Program, investing approximately $675 million in this program.  These facilities are owned by APS and are located in multiple locations throughout Arizona.  In addition to the AZ Sun Program, APS developed the 44 MW Red Rock Solar Plant and the 150 MW Agave Solar Plant, each of which it owns and operates, and has contracted for the construction of the 168 MW Ironwood Solar Plant.\nAPS owns and operates more than thirty small solar systems around the state.  Together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 MW of renewable energy.  This fleet of solar systems includes a  3 MW facility located at the Prescott Airport and 1 MW of small solar systems in various locations across Arizona.  APS has also developed solar photovoltaic DG systems installed as part of the Community Power Project in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The Community Power Project, approved by the ACC on April 1, 2010, was a pilot program through which APS owns, operates, and receives energy from approximately 1 MW of solar photovoltaic DG systems located within a certain test area in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The pilot program is now complete and as part of the 2017 Rate Case Decision, the participants have been transferred to the Solar Partner Program described below.  Additionally, APS owns 13 MW of solar photovoltaic systems installed across Arizona through the ACC-approved Schools and Government Program.  \nIn December 2014, the ACC voted that it had no objection to APS implementing an APS-owned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid.  The first stage of the program, called the “Solar Partner Program,” placed 8 MW of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits, as well as made systems available to limited-income customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties.  The second stage of the program, which included an additional 2 MW of rooftop solar and energy storage, placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 MW on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various grid-related operation improvements and system interoperability, and was in operation by the end of 2016.  The costs for this program have been included in APS’s rate base as part of the 2017 Rate Case Decision.  \nIn the 2017 Rate Case Decision, the ACC also approved the “APS Solar Communities” program.  APS Solar Communities (formerly AZ Sun II) is a three-year program authorizing APS to spend $10 \n11\nTable of Contents\nmillion to $15 million in capital costs each year to install utility-owned DG systems on low to moderate income residential homes, non-profit entities, Title I schools, and rural government facilities.  The 2017 Rate Case Decision provided that all operations and maintenance expenses, property taxes, marketing and advertising expenses, and the capital carrying costs for this program will be recovered through the RES.  Currently, APS has installed 14 MW of DG systems under the APS Solar Communities program.  In the 2019 Rate Case decision, the ACC authorized APS to spend $20 million to $30 million in capital costs for the APS Solar Communities program each year for a period of three years from the effective date of the decision.  Subsequently, on March 5, 2024, the ACC ordered APS not to expand or extend the APS Solar Communities program.  Consistent with that decision, the Solar Communities program has been discontinued and APS stopped enrolling new customers.  APS will continue work on projects that were enrolled prior to that decision.\nRenewable Energy Portfolio\nTo date, APS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 7,660 MW, including biogas, biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind.  Of this portfolio, 3,608 MW are currently in operation and 4,052 MW are under contract for development or are under construction.  Renewable resources in operation include 416 MW of facilities owned by APS, 1,465 MW of long-term purchased power agreements, and an estimated 1,727 MW of customer-sited, third-party owned distributed energy resources.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS issued an ASRFP (the “2023 ASRFP”) pursuant to which\n \nAPS procured nearly 7,300 MW of new resources to be in service from 2026 to 2028. \nOn November 20, 2024, APS issued an ASRFP (the “2024 ASRFP”) seeking 2,000 MW of resources.  APS is seeking projects that can reach commercial operation beginning June 1, 2028 through June 1, 2030 but will consider projects that may achieve commercial operation as early as 2026.  Additionally, APS is interested in projects that require longer planning, permitting, and construction and can be commercially operational after June 1, 2030.  Bids for the 2024 ASRFP were due on February 5, 2025.\n \nAPS’s strategy to achieve its RES requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities, ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by APS.  See “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Solar Facilities” above for information regarding APS-owned solar facilities and “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Energy Storage” below for more information regarding APS-owned energy storage facilities.\nThe following table summarizes APS’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development as of the date of this report.  Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid.\n \nLocation\nActual/\n \nTarget\nCommercial\nOperation\nDate\nTerm\n(Years)\nNet\n \nCapacity\n \nIn Operation\n(MW AC)\nNet Capacity\n \nPlanned/Under\nDevelopment\n(MW AC)\nAPS Owned\n \n \n \n \n \nSolar:\n \n \n \n \n \nAZ Sun Program:\n \n \n \n \n \nPaloma\nGila Bend, AZ\n2011\n \n17\n \n \n12\nTable of Contents\nCotton Center\nGila Bend, AZ\n2011\n \n17\n \n \nHyder Phase 1\nHyder, AZ\n2011\n \n11\n \n \nHyder Phase 2\nHyder, AZ\n2012\n \n6\n \n \nChino Valley\nChino Valley, AZ\n2012\n \n20\n \n \nHyder II\nHyder, AZ\n2013\n \n14\n \n \nFoothills\nYuma, AZ\n2013\n \n38\n \n \nGila Bend\nGila Bend, AZ\n2014\n \n36\n \nLuke AFB\nGlendale, AZ\n2015\n11\n \nDesert Star\nBuckeye, AZ\n2015\n10\n \nSubtotal AZ Sun Program\n \n \n \n180\n \n—\n \nMultiple Facilities\nAZ\nVarious\n \n4\n \n \nRed Rock\nRed Rock, AZ\n2016\n44\n \nAgave Solar\nArlington, AZ\n2023\n150\n \nIronwood Solar\nDateland, AZ\n2026\n168\nDistributed Energy:\n \n \n \n \n \nAPS Owned (a)\nAZ\nVarious\n \n38\n \nTotal APS Owned\n \n \n \n416\n \n168\n \nPPAs\n \n \n \n \n \nSolar:\n \n \n \n \n \nSolana\nGila Bend, AZ\n2013\n30\n \n250\n \n \nRE Ajo\nAjo, AZ\n2011\n25\n \n5\n \n \nSun E AZ 1\nPrescott, AZ\n2011\n30\n \n10\n \n \nSaddle Mountain\nTonopah, AZ\n2012\n30\n \n15\n \n \nBadger\nTonopah, AZ\n2013\n30\n \n15\n \n \nGillespie\nMaricopa County, AZ\n2013\n30\n \n15\n \n \nMesquite Solar 5\nTonopah, AZ\n2023\n20\n \n60\n \nSunstreams 3\nArlington, AZ\n2024\n20\n \n215\n \nYuma Solar Energy\nYuma County, AZ\n2025\n20\n \n70\n \nHarquahala Sun 2\nTonopah, AZ\n2025\n20\n \n300\n \nSunstreams 4\nArlington, AZ\n2025\n20\n \n300\n \nSerrano Solar\nPima and Pinal County, AZ\n2025\n20\n \n170\n \nCO Bar Solar C\nCoconino County, AZ\n2027\n20\n \n206\n \nHashknife 1\nNavajo County, AZ\n2026\n20\n \n275\n \nCatclaw\nBuckeye, AZ\n2026\n20\n \n225\n \nPapago Solar\nMaricopa County, AZ\n2026\n20\n \n150\n \nHashknife 2\nNavajo County, AZ\n2027\n20\n \n200\n \nKitt\nEloy, AZ\n2026\n20\n \n100\n \nPioneer\nYuma, AZ\n2027\n20\n \n300\n \nMaricopa Energy Center Phase 1\nMaricopa County, AZ\n2026\n20\n \n183\n \nMaricopa Energy Center Phase 2\nMaricopa County, AZ\n2027\n20\n \n367\n \nSnowflake Solar\nSnowflake, AZ\n2027\n20\n \n475\n \nWind:\n \n \n \n \n \nAragonne Mesa\nSanta Rosa, NM\n2022\n20\n \n200\n \nHigh Lonesome\nMountainair, NM\n2009\n30\n \n100\n \n \nPerrin Ranch Wind\nWilliams, AZ\n2012\n25\n \n99\n \n \nChevelon Butte\nWinslow, AZ\n2023\n20\n \n238\n \nChevelon Butte II\nWinslow, AZ\n2024\n20\n \n216\n \nWest Camp Wind Farm\nNavajo County, AZ\n2026\n20\n \n500\n \n13\nTable of Contents\nGeothermal:\n \n \n \n \n \nSalton Sea\nImperial County, CA\n2006\n23\n \n10\n \n \nBiomass:\n \n \n \n \n \nSnowflake\nSnowflake, AZ\n2008\n25\n \n14\n \n \nBiogas:\n \n \n \n \n \nNW Regional Landfill\nSurprise, AZ\n2012\n20\n \n3\n \n \nTotal PPAs\n \n \n \n1,465\n \n3,821\n \nDistributed Energy\n \n \n \n \n \nSolar\n (b)\n \n \n \n \n \nThird-party Owned\nAZ\nVarious\n \n1,694\n \n63\n \nAgreement 1\nBagdad, AZ\n2011\n25\n \n15\n \n \nAgreement 2\nAZ\n2011-2012\n20-21\n18\n \n \nTotal Distributed Energy\n \n \n \n1,727\n \n63\n \nTotal Renewable Portfolio\n \n \n \n3,608\n \n4,052\n \n(a)\nIncludes Flagstaff Community Power Project, APS School and Government Program, APS Solar Partner Program, and APS Solar Communities Program.\n(b)\nIncludes rooftop solar facilities owned by third parties.  DG is produced in direct current and is converted to alternating current for reporting purposes.\nEnergy Storage\nAPS deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system, including energy storage.  Energy storage provides capacity, improves power quality, can be utilized for system regulation and, in certain circumstances, be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments.  Energy storage also aids in integrating renewable generation by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset.  APS is utilizing grid-scale energy storage projects to meet customer reliability requirements, increase renewable utilization, and further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid.  \nSee “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition — Clean Energy Commitment — Energy Storage” for a table summarizing the resources in APS’s energy storage portfolio that are in operation and under development as of the date of this report.\n \nAgreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions.\nPurchased Power Contracts\nIn addition to its own available generating capacity, APS purchases electricity under various arrangements, including long-term contracts and purchases through short-term markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements.  A portion of APS’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  See Note 15.  APS continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability.  In addition, APS has also entered into several PPAs for energy storage.  See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Energy Storage” above for details on our energy storage PPAs.\n14\nTable of Contents\nPurchased Power Capacity —\n APS’s purchased power capacity under long-term contracts as of the date of this report is summarized in the table below.  All capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted.\nType\n \nDates Available\n \nCapacity \n(MW)\nPurchase Agreement (a)\nYear-round through June 14, 2025\n46 \nDemand Response Agreement\n \nSummer seasons through 2025\n \n75 \nTolling Agreement\nMay 1 through April 30, 2021-2025\n463 \n        Extension Term \nMay 1 through October 31, 2025-2032\n525 \nTolling Agreement\nJune 1 through September 30, 2020-2026\n565 \n        Extension Term \nMay 1 through October 31, 2026-2031\n565 \nTolling Agreement\nJune 1 through September 30, 2020-2026\n570 \n        Extension Term \nMay 1 through October 31, 2027-2034\n600 \nRenewable Energy (b)\n \nVarious\n \n1,465 \n(a)\nUp to 46 MW of capacity is available; however, the amount of electricity available to APS under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually.\n(b)\nDoes not include MW of capacity planned or under development.  See “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Renewable Energy Portfolio” for more details on renewable energy power purchase agreements.\nCurrent and Future Resources\n \nCurrent Demand and Reserve Margin \nElectric power demand is generally seasonal.  In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months.  APS’s 2024 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on August 4, 2024, at 8,210 MW, compared to the 2023 peak of 8,162 MW recorded on July 15, 2023.  APS’s reserve margin at the time of the 2024 peak demand, calculated using system load serving capacity, was 15%.  For 2025, APS is procuring market resources to maintain its minimum 16% planning reserve criteria.\nFuture Resources and Resource Plan\nACC rules require utilities to develop 15-year Integrated Resource Plans (“IRP”) which describe how the utility plans to serve customer load in the plan timeframe.  The ACC reviews each utility’s IRP to determine if it meets the necessary rule requirements and whether it should be acknowledged.  On May 1, 2023, APS, Tucson Electric Power Company, and UNS Electric, Inc. filed a joint request for an extension to file the IRPs from August 1 to November 1.\n \nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC granted the extension.\n \nAs a result, APS filed its 2023 IRP on November 1, 2023.\n \n On January 31, 2024, stakeholders filed comments regarding the IRP, and APS filed its response to stakeholder comments on May 31, 2024.  On July 31, 2024, the ACC held an IRP workshop where utilities and stakeholders presented on the 2023 IRPs.  On October 8, 2024, the ACC acknowledged APS’s 2023 IRP and approved certain amendments to the IRP process, including requirements for APS to demonstrate resource adequacy prior to exiting Four Corners as well as analysis of impacts from western market participation and planned resource requirements in the next IRP.\nSee “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Clean Energy Focus Initiatives” and “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Energy Storage” above for information regarding future plans for energy storage.  \n15\nTable of Contents\nSee “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Coal-Fueled Generating Facilities” above for information regarding plans for Cholla, Four Corners and the Navajo Plant. \nWestern Energy Imbalance Market and Wholesale Market\nIn 2016, APS began to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (“WEIM”), a voluntary, real-time optimization market operated by the CAISO.  The WEIM allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15-minute blocks and dispatching generation every five minutes, instead of the traditional one-hour blocks.  APS continues to expect that its participation in WEIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS’s renewable resources.  APS participated in market design and tariff development of Markets+, a day-ahead and real-time market offering from Southwest Power Pool (“SPP”).  The Markets+ tariff was filed with FERC on March 29, 2024 and was approved on January 16, 2025.  APS announced a market decision to pursue participation in SPP Markets+.  In addition, APS is participating in the Western Resource Adequacy Program administered by Western Power Pool and is transitioning to full binding participation as early as summer 2027.  These regional efforts are driven by the objectives of reducing customer cost and improving reliability.\nEnergy Modernization Plan \nIn June 2021, the ACC adopted clean energy rules based on a series of ACC amendments to the final energy rules.  The adopted rules require 100% clean energy by 2070 and the following interim standards for carbon reduction from a baseline carbon emissions level: 50% reduction by December 31, 2032; 65% reduction by December 31, 2040; 80% reduction by December 31, 2050, and 95% reduction by December 31, 2060.  Since the adopted clean energy rules differed substantially from the original Recommended Opinion and Order (“ROO”), supplemental rulemaking procedures were required before the rules could become effective.  On January 26, 2022, the ACC reversed its prior decision and declined to send the final draft energy rules through the rulemaking process.  Instead, the ACC opened a new docket to consider all-source request for proposals (“ASRFP”) requirements and the IRP process.  During the August 2022 ACC Open Meeting, the ACC voted to postpone a decision on the ASRFP and IRP rulemaking package until 2023.  On May 26, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to review articles within the Arizona Administrative Code related to Resource Planning, the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, and Electric Energy Efficiency Standards.  On January 9, 2024, the ACC approved a rulemaking process to begin on this matter.  During the ACC Open Meeting on February 6, 2024, the ACC approved motions to direct ACC Staff to include recommendations to repeal the current Electric Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Standard rules during the rulemaking process.  On August 21, 2024, ACC Staff proposed amendments striking the rules and filed preliminary economic, small business, and consumer impact statements, consistent with the formal rulemaking process.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  See Note 3 for additional information related to these energy rules. \n16\nTable of Contents\nRenewable Energy Standard  \nIn 2006, the ACC approved the RES.  Under the RES, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources, including, for example, solar, wind, biomass, biogas and geothermal technologies.  In order to achieve these requirements, the ACC allows APS to include a RES surcharge as part of customer bills to recover the approved amounts for use on renewable energy projects.  Each year, APS is required to file a five-year implementation plan with the ACC and seek approval for funding the upcoming year’s RES budget.\nIn June 2021, the ACC adopted a clean energy rules package which would require APS to meet certain clean energy standards and technology procurement mandates, obtain approval for its action plan included in its IRP, and seek cost recovery in a rate process. \n \nSince the adopted clean energy rules differed substantially from the original ROO, supplemental rulemaking procedures were required before the rules could become effective.  On January 26, 2022, the ACC reversed its prior decision and declined to send the final draft energy rules through the rulemaking process.  Instead, the ACC opened a new docket to consider ASRFP requirements and the IRP process.  See “Energy Modernization Plan” above for more information.\nOn July 1, 2021, APS filed its 2022 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $93.1 million.  APS filed an amended 2022 RES Implementation Plan on December 9, 2021, with a proposed budget of $100.5 million.  This budget included funding for programs to comply with the decision in the 2019 Rate Case, including the ACC authorizing spending $20 million to $30 million in capital costs for the continuation of the APS Solar Communities program each year for a period of three years from the effective date of the 2019 Rate Case decision.  APS’s budget proposal supported existing approved projects and commitments and requested a waiver of the RES residential and non-residential distributed energy requirements for 2022.  On May 18, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 RES Implementation Plan, including an amendment requiring a stakeholder working group convene to develop a community solar program for the ACC’s consideration at a future date.  \nOn July 1, 2022, APS filed its 2023 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $86.2 million, excluding any funding offsets.  This budget contained funding for programs to comply with ACC-approved initiatives, including the 2019 Rate Case decision.  APS’s budget proposal supported existing approved projects and commitments and requested a waiver of the RES residential and non-residential distributed energy requirements for 2022.  On November 10, 2022, the ACC approved the 2023 RES Implementation Plan, including APS’s requested waiver of the distributed energy requirement for 2023.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS filed its 2024 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $95.1 million.  APS’s budget proposal supports existing approved projects and commitments and requests a waiver of the RES renewable energy credit requirements to demonstrate compliance with the Annual Renewable Energy Requirement for 2023.  The ACC has not yet ruled on the 2024 RES Implementation Plan.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\nOn July 1, 2024, APS filed its 2025 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $92.7 million.\n \nAPS’s budget proposal supports existing approved projects and commitments and requests a waiver of the RES renewable energy credit requirements to demonstrate compliance with the Annual Renewable Energy Requirement for 2024.\n \nThe ACC has not yet ruled on the 2025 RES Implementation Plan.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\n17\nTable of Contents\nOn June 14, 2021, APS filed an application for approval of its Green Power Partners Program (“GPP”).  On September 1, 2021, the ACC approved the application.  On June 28, 2024, APS filed an application for approval of modifications to the GPP and requested a renewable generation renewable energy credits waiver.  The ACC has not yet ruled on the GPP application.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.  \nDemand Side Management\nOn January 1, 2011, Arizona regulators adopted an EES of 22% cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 to increase energy efficiency and other DSM programs encouraging customers to conserve energy, while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy.  APS achieved the 22% EES in 2021.  See Note 3 for information regarding energy efficiency, other DSM obligations and the Energy Modernization Plan.\nCompetitive Environment and Regulatory Oversight\n \nRetail \n \nThe ACC regulates APS’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities.  The ACC must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of APS’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS, and their respective affiliates.  See Note 3 for information regarding ACC’s regulation of APS’s retail electric rates.\n \nAPS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned electric and gas utilities in Arizona (such as Southwest Gas Corporation), as well as cooperatives, municipalities, electrical districts, and similar types of governmental or non-profit organizations.  In addition, some customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements.  This practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs.\n \nOn November 17, 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona.  On July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.  On February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules.  On February 12, 2020, ACC Staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.  During a July 15, 2020, ACC Staff meeting, the ACC Commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program, but no action was taken.  In April 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed, and the Governor signed a bill that repealed the electric deregulation law that had been in place in Arizona since 1998.  On August 27, 2024, the ACC administratively closed this docket due to inactivity and obsolescence.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWholesale\n \nFERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services.  See Note 3 for information regarding APS’s transmission rates.  During 2024, approximately 4.2% of APS’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services.  APS’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements.  APS also sells, in the wholesale market, its generation output that is not needed for APS’s Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers.  Additionally, subject to specified parameters, APS hedges both electricity and natural gas.  The majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in APS’s portfolio.\nTransmission and Delivery\nAPS continues to work closely with customers, stakeholders, and regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that support new customers, system reliability, access to markets and clean energy development.  The capital expenditures table presented in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this report includes new APS transmission projects, along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements, including those for data center and semi-conductor manufacturing development.  To prioritize reliability and meet substantial growth in residential and commercial energy needs, APS has developed a future-focused, strategic transmission plan (the “Ten-Year Transmission Plan”).  The Ten-Year Transmission Plan includes five critical transmission projects that comprise the APS strategic transmission portfolio, which represents a significant upgrade to APS’s transmission system.  These five projects, along with other projects included in the Ten-Year Transmission Plan, are intended to support growing energy needs, strengthen reliability, and allow for the connection of new resources.  \nAPS is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide long-term benefits both to APS and its customers.  APS is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better manage their energy usage, minimize system outage durations and frequency, enable customer choice for new customer sited technologies, and facilitate greater cost savings to APS through improved reliability and the automation of certain delivery functions.\nEnvironmental Matters\nClimate Change \nLegislative Initiatives. \n There have been no recent successful attempts by Congress to pass legislation that would regulate GHG emissions, and it is unclear at this time whether legislation regulating or limiting utility-sector GHG emissions introduced during prior sessions of Congress will become law.  In the event climate change legislation ultimately passes, the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on APS depends on a variety of factors, none of which can be fully known until a law is written, enacted, and the specifics of the resulting program are established.  These factors include, without limitation, the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed GHG emissions; the cost to reduce emissions; in the event a cap-and-trade program is established, whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned (and, if so, the cost of those allowances in the marketplace) and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available; \n19\nTable of Contents\nand, in the event of a carbon tax, the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide (“CO\n2\n”) equivalent emitted.\nIn addition to federal legislative initiatives, state-specific initiatives may also impact our business.  While Arizona has no pending legislation regulating GHGs, the California legislature enacted AB 32 and Senate Bill (“SB”) 1368 in 2006 to address GHG emissions.  In October 2011, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) approved final regulations that established a state-wide cap on GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2013, and established a GHG allowance trading program under that cap.  The first phase of the program, which applies to, among other entities, importers of electricity, commenced on January 1, 2013.  Under the program, entities selling electricity into California, including APS, must hold carbon allowances to cover GHG emissions associated with electricity sales into California from outside the state.  APS is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the PSA.\nThe California legislature also enacted SB 219, SB 253, and SB 261, which mandate climate-related disclosures for certain companies doing business in California.  CARB is expected to issue regulations for these bills in 2025.  Pinnacle West and APS are currently reviewing whether they would be required to make disclosures pursuant to these bills.\nRegulatory Initiatives.\n  In 2009, EPA determined that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare.  As a result of this “endangerment finding,” EPA determined that the Clean Air Act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major GHG emitting sources, including power plants.  APS will generally be required to consider the impact of GHG emissions as part of its traditional New Source Review analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants.  \nEPA’s regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from electric utility power plants has proceeded in fits and starts over most of the last decade.  Starting on August 3, 2015, EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, which was the Agency’s first effort at such regulation through system-wide generation dispatch shifting.  Those regulations were subsequently repealed by the EPA on June 19, 2019, and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) regulations, which were a far narrower set of rules.  While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit subsequently vacated the ACE regulations on January 19, 2021, and ordered a remand for EPA to develop replacement regulations consistent with the original 2015 Clean Power Plan, the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently reversed that decision on June 30, 2022, holding that the Clean Power Plan exceeded EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.\nIn the final regulations governing power plant carbon dioxide emissions released April 25, 2024, EPA issued emission standards and guidelines for various subcategories of new and existing power plants.  Unlike EPA’s Clean Power Plan regulations from 2015, which took a broad, system-wide approach to regulating carbon emissions from electric utility fossil-fuel burning power plants, these new federal regulations are limited to measures that can be installed at individual power plants to limit planet-warming carbon-dioxide emissions.  \nAs such, for new natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants, EPA is proposing that carbon emission performance standards apply based on the annual capacity factors.  For the highest utilization combustion turbines, EPA is therefore proposing that such facilities be retrofitted for carbon capture and sequestration or utilization controls (“CCS”) by 2032.  For intermediate or low-load natural gas fired combustion turbines, those with 40% or less capacity factors, EPA’s regulations would not require add-on pollution controls.  Instead, natural gas-fired combustion turbines with capacity factors of up to 20% would be effectively unregulated, while such turbines with capacity factors over 20% and up to 40% would be subject to carbon dioxide emission rate limitations.  EPA did not finalize standards for existing natural gas-\n20\nTable of Contents\nfired combustion turbines but has indicated that it will propose a new set of standards, initiating a separate rulemaking, for these existing gas-fired power plants within the next year.\nFor coal-fired power plants, instead of imposing regulations based on capacity and utilization, EPA has finalized subcategories based on planned retirement dates.  This means that facilities retiring before 2032 are effectively exempt from regulation, those that retire between 2032 and 2038 must co-fire with natural gas starting in 2030, and those that retire in 2039 or later must install CCS controls by 2032.  \nAs of May 10, 2024, several states, electric utility companies, affiliated trade associations, and other entities filed petitions for review of these regulations in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  APS is participating in that litigation as part of an ad hoc coalition of electric utility companies, independent power producers, and trade groups, called Electric Generators for a Sensible Transition.  We cannot predict the outcome of the litigation challenging EPA’s latest carbon emission standards for power plants.  In addition, the Trump administration has stated that it intends to reverse or substantially revise these standards.  We cannot predict the outcome of future rulemaking or other regulatory proceedings aimed at changing or eliminating the current EPA emission standards for power plants.\nIf this regulation remains in effect, it will likely lead to a material increase in APS’s costs to build, operate, and maintain new, frequently operated gas-fired power plants.  The regulatory deadlines in 2032 by which new, frequently operated gas-fired power plants must install carbon capture and sequestration and achieve 90% capture efficiency may not be feasible.  Future resource plans and procurement efforts implicating the development of such new generation remains pending and, as such, at this time APS is not able to quantify the financial impact associated with EPA’s GHG regulations for power plants.\nOther environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations, the ozone national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) and other rules or matters involving the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, RCRA, Superfund, the Navajo Nation, and water supplies for our power plants.  The financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of APS’s fossil-fuel powered plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants.  The economics of continuing to own certain resources, particularly our coal plants, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments.  APS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery.\n        \nEPA Environmental Regulation\nCoal Combustion Waste.\n  On December 19, 2014, EPA issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, such as fly ash and bottom ash.  The rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions.  These criteria include standards governing\n \nlocation restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements.  The rule generally requires any existing unlined CCR surface impoundment to stop receiving CCR and either retrofit or close, and further requires the closure of any CCR landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity.  Such closure requirements are deemed “forced closure” or “closure for cause” of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of recent regulatory and judicial activities described below.\n21\nTable of Contents\nSince these regulations were finalized, EPA has taken steps to substantially modify the federal rules governing CCR disposal.  While certain changes have been prompted by utility industry petitions, others have resulted from judicial review, court-approved settlements with environmental groups, and statutory changes to RCRA.  The following lists the pending regulatory changes that, if finalized, could have a material impact as to how APS manages CCR at its coal-fired power plants:\n•\nFollowing the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (“WIIN”) Act in 2016, EPA possesses authority to either authorize states to develop their own permit programs for CCR management or issue federal permits governing CCR disposal both in states without their own permit programs and on tribal lands.  At this time, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (“ADEQ”) has taken steps to develop a CCR permitting program. It remains unclear when the EPA would approve the permitting program pursuant to the WIIN Act.  On December 19, 2019, EPA proposed its own set of regulations governing the issuance of CCR management permits, \nwhich would impact facilities like Four Corners located on the Navajo Nation. \n The proposal remains pending.   \n•\nOn March 1, 2018, as a result of a settlement with certain environmental groups, EPA proposed adding boron to the list of constituents that trigger corrective action requirements to remediate groundwater impacted by CCR disposal activities.  Apart from a subsequent proposal issued on August 14, 2019, to add a specific, health-based groundwater protection standard for boron, EPA has yet to take action on this proposal.  \n \n•\nWith respect to APS’s Cholla facility, APS’s application for alternative closure was submitted to EPA on November 30, 2020.  While EPA has deemed APS’s application administratively “complete,” the Agency’s approval remains pending.  If granted, this application would allow the continued disposal of CCR within Cholla’s existing unlined CCR surface impoundments until the required date for ceasing coal-fired boiler operations in April 2025.  This application will be subject to public comment and, potentially, judicial review.  \nWe expect to have a proposed decision from EPA regarding Cholla in 2025\n.  \nWe cannot at this time predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings or when the EPA will take final action on those matters that are still pending.\n \nDepending on the eventual outcome, the costs associated with APS’s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOn April 25, 2024, EPA took final action on a proposal to expand the scope of federal CCR regulations to address the impacts from historical CCR disposal activities that would have ceased prior to 2015.  This new class of CCR management units (“CCRMUs”), which contain at least 1,000 tons of CCR, broadly encompass any location at an operating coal-fired power plant where CCR would have been placed on land.  As proposed, this would include not only historically closed landfills and surface impoundments but also prior applications of CCR beneficial use (with exceptions for historical roadbed and embankment applications).  Existing CCR regulatory requirements for groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, post-closure care, and other requirements will be imposed on such CCRMUs.  At this time, APS is still evaluating the impacts of this final regulation on its business, with initial CCRMU site surveys due to be completed by February 2026 and final site investigation reports to be finalized by February 2027.  Based on the information available to APS at this time, APS cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the entire CCRMU asset retirement obligation.  Depending on the outcome of those evaluations and site \n22\nTable of Contents\ninvestigations, the costs associated with APS’s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAPS currently disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners.  The Navajo Plant disposed of CCR only in a dry landfill storage area.\n \nAdditionally, the CCR rule requires ongoing, phased groundwater monitoring.  As of October 2018, APS has completed the statistical analyses for its CCR disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring.\n \nAPS determined that several of its CCR disposal units at Cholla and Four Corners will need to undergo corrective action.\n \nIn addition, under the current regulations, all such disposal units must have ceased operating and initiated closure as of April 11, 2021 (except for those disposal units subject to alternative closure).\n \nAPS completed the assessments of corrective measures on June 14, 2019; however, additional investigations and engineering analyses that will support the remedy selection are still underway.\n \nIn addition, APS has also solicited input from the public and hosted public hearings as part of this process.\n  APS’s estimates for its share of corrective action and monitoring costs at Four Corners and Cholla are captured within the Asset Retirement Obligations.  \nAs APS continues to implement the CCR rule’s corrective action assessment process, the current cost estimates may change.\n \nGiven uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment and final remedy selection process, we cannot predict any ultimate impacts to APS; however, at this time APS does not believe that any potential changes to the cost estimate from the CCR rule’s corrective action assessment process for Four Corners or Cholla would have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEffluent Limitation Guidelines\n.  \n \nEPA published effluent limitation guidelines (“ELG”) on October 13, 2020, and based off those guidelines, APS completed a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit modification for Four Corners on December 1, 2023.  The ELG standards finalized in October 2020 relaxed the “zero discharge” standard for bottom ash transport waters EPA finalized in September 2015.  However, on April 25, 2024, EPA finalized new ELG regulations that once again require “zero discharge” standards for flows of bottom ash transport water at power plants like Four Corners.  Nonetheless, for power plants that permanently cease operations by December 31, 2034, such facilities can continue to comply with the 2020 ELG standards.  APS is currently evaluating its compliance options for Four Corners based on the ELG regulations finalized in April 2024 and is assessing what impacts the new standards will have on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOzone National Ambient Air Quality Standards.  \nOn October 1, 2015, EPA finalized revisions to the primary ground-level ozone NAAQS at a level of 70 parts per billion (“ppb”).  Further, on      December 23, 2020, EPA issued a final regulation retaining the current primary NAAQS for ozone, following a required scientific review process.  With ozone standards becoming more stringent, our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of NOx and volatile organic compounds, and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas.  EPA was expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by October 1, 2017.   While EPA took action designating attainment and unclassifiable areas on November 6, 2017, the Agency’s final action designating non-attainment areas was not issued until April 30, 2018.  At that time, EPA designated the geographic areas containing Yuma and Phoenix, Arizona as in non-attainment with the 2015 70 ppb ozone NAAQS.  The vast majority of APS’s natural gas-fired EGUs are located in these jurisdictions.  Areas of Arizona and the Navajo Nation where the remainder of APS’s fossil-fuel fired EGU fleet is located were designated as in attainment.  At this time, because proposed SIPs and FIPs implementing the revised ozone NAAQSs have yet to be released, APS is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on APS.  APS will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting APS.\n23\nTable of Contents\nEPA Good Neighbor Proposal for Arizona\n.  \nOn March 15, 2023, EPA issued its final Good Neighbor Plan for 23 states in order to ensure that the cross-state transport of ozone forming emissions does not interfere with downwind state compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”).  Thermal power plant emission limitations are a key aspect of these regulations, which involve emission allowance trading for nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions.  While Arizona was not among the 23 states subject to EPA’s March 2023 final action, EPA announced on January 23, 2024 that it was proposing to add Arizona and New Mexico (along with two other additional states) to EPA’s NOx emission allowance trading program finalized last year.  That proposal involves adding these states to the Good Neighbor Plan and disapproving the corresponding provisions of each state’s State Implementation Plan.  Because APS operates thermal power plants within Arizona and those portions of the Navajo Nation within New Mexico, APS’s power plants would be subject to EPA’s Good Neighbor Plan upon finalization of this proposal.  EPA’s final Good Neighbor Plan is subject to ongoing judicial review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a motion to stay the effectiveness of EPA’s final Good Neighbor Plan pending the resolution of the litigation.  As such, APS will not be impacted by the Good Neighbor Plan until the outcome of this litigation is finalized.  In addition, on December 19, 2024, EPA announced that it was withdrawing its proposal to add Arizona (along with other western states) to the federal Good Neighbor Plan.  As such, while EPA may elect to resume work on and finalize this proposal in the future, it is unlikely to do so over a near-term horizon.  APS cannot predict the outcome of any future EPA efforts to add Arizona to the federal Good Neighbor Plan (which depends on action disapproving the Arizona State Implementation Plan) or whether the Good Neighbor Plan itself will remain in effect pending the outcome of judicial review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  Should the Good Neighbor Plan ultimately be imposed on APS and its operations in Arizona and New Mexico, it would have material impact on both the costs to operate current APS power plants and APS’s ability to develop new thermal generation to serve load.  At this time, APS cannot predict the impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRevised Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (“MATS”) Proposal.\n  On April 25, 2024, EPA finalized revisions to the existing MATS regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollution from existing coal-fired power plants.  The final regulations increase the stringency of filterable particulate matter limits used to demonstrate compliance with MATS and require the use of continuous emissions monitoring systems to ensure compliance (as opposed to periodic performance testing).  These final regulations will take effect for existing coal-fired power plants, such as Four Corners, within three years of publication in the Federal Register.  Based on APS’s assessment of the revised MATS regulations, this final rule is unlikely to have a material impact on plant operations or require significant capital expenditures to ensure compliance.\nSuperfund-Related Matters.  \nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund” or “CERCLA”) establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil, water or air.  Those who released, generated, transported to or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible (each a “PRP”).  PRPs may be strictly, jointly, and severally liable for clean-up.  On September 3, 2003, EPA advised APS that EPA considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52nd Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (“OU3”) in Phoenix, Arizona.  APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site.  APS and Pinnacle West have agreed with EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within OU3.  In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study (“RI/FS”).  The RI/FS for OU3 was finalized and submitted to EPA at the end of 2022.  EPA notified APS that the RI/FS was approved on September 11, 2024.  APS’s estimated costs related to this investigation and study is approximately \n$3 million\n.  APS anticipates incurring additional expenditures in the future, but \n24\nTable of Contents\nbecause the final costs associated with remediation requirements set forth in the RI/FS are not yet finalized, at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated. \nIn connection with APS’s status as a PRP for OU3, since 2013 APS and at least two dozen other parties have been defendants in various CERCLA lawsuits stemming from allegations that contamination from OU3 and elsewhere has impacted groundwater wells operated by the Roosevelt Irrigation District (“RID”).  At this time, only one active lawsuit remains pending in the U.S. District Court for Arizona, which concerns\n \n$8.3 million in remediation legal expenses.  APS is unable to predict the outcome of any further litigation related to this claim or APS’s share of liability related to that claim; however, APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \nOn February 28, 2022, EPA provided APS with a request for information under CERCLA related to APS’s Ocotillo power plant site located in Tempe, Arizona.  In particular, EPA seeks information from APS regarding APS’s use, storage, and disposal of substances containing per-and polyfluoroalkyl (“PFAS”) compounds at the Ocotillo power plant site in order to aid EPA’s investigation into actual or threatened releases of PFAS into groundwater within the South Indian Bend Wash (“SIBW”) Superfund site.  The SIBW Superfund site includes the APS Ocotillo power plant site.  APS filed its response to this information request on April 29, 2022.  On January 17, 2023, EPA contacted APS to inform APS that it would be commencing on-site investigations within the SIBW site, including the Ocotillo power plant, and performing a remedial investigation and feasibility study related to potential PFAS impacts to groundwater over the next two to three years.  APS estimates that its costs to oversee and participate in the remedial investigation work will be approximately $1.7 million.  At the present time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter, and any further expenditures related to necessary remediation, if any, or further investigations cannot be reasonably estimated. \nFour Corners National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit \nThe latest NPDES permit for Four Corners was issued on September 30, 2019.  Based upon a November 1, 2019 filing by several environmental groups, the Environmental Appeals Board (“EAB”) took up review of the Four Corners NPDES Permit.  The EAB denied the environmental group petition on     September 30, 2020.  While on January 22, 2021, the environmental groups filed a petition for review of the EAB’s decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the parties to the litigation (including APS) finalized a settlement on May 2, 2022.  This settlement requires investigation of thermal wastewater discharges from Four Corners, administratively closes the litigation filed in January of 2021, and APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWater Supply\nBased on a declaration from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, as of January 1, 2025, Arizona’s supply of Colorado River water will remain subject to a Tier 1 shortage.  This is the third year since 2022 that a Tier 1 shortage has been declared.  The most severe shortage to have been declared was a Tier 2a shortage in 2023.  A Tier 1 shortage reduces Arizona’s share of the Colorado River water by 18 percent or 512,000-acre feet; however, due to in-state conservation measures, Arizona has kept more Colorado River water in Lake Mead than is required by the shortage.  Tier 1 reductions are largely felt by central Arizona’s agricultural users, mainly in Pinal County.  Assured supplies of water are important for APS’s generating plants.  At this time, a Tier 1 shortage does not materially impact water supplies used by APS’s fleet of generation resources.  As drought conditions across the southwestern U.S. region continue to worsen, APS will monitor water availability necessary for continued Company operations and, as necessary, implement measures to mitigate risks associated with future Colorado River shortage declarations.       \nConflicting claims to drought-impacted surface water in the southwestern United States have resulted in disputes and numerous court actions.  The General Stream Adjudication allows the state to issue a final priority determination on claims to surface water rights.  There are three General Stream Adjudications near APS generating stations that may impact surface water or groundwater supplies that are adjacent to surface water streams.\nSan Juan River Adjudication.  \nBoth groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’s operations have been the subject of inquiries, claims, and legal proceedings, which will require a number of years to resolve.  APS is one of numerous parties in a proceeding, filed March 13, 1975, before the Eleventh Judicial District Court in New Mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for Four Corners is derived.  An agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985, however, provides that if Four Corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for an agreed upon cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.  In addition, APS is a party to a water contract that allows the Company to secure water for Four Corners in the event of a water shortage in the San Juan River Basin.\nGila River Adjudication.  \nA summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants in the Lower Gila River Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before January 20, 1987, in an action pending in Arizona Superior Court.  Palo Verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons.  APS’s rights and the rights of the other Palo Verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in this adjudication.  As operating agent of Palo Verde, APS filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the Palo Verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo Verde.  Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights.  Several of APS’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons, including a number of gas-fired power plants located within Maricopa and Pinal Counties.  In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and Indian tribes.  In addition, in September 2000, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims.  Litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court.  In December 2005, APS and other parties filed a petition with the Arizona Supreme Court requesting interlocutory review of a September 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights.  The Arizona Supreme Court denied the petition in May 2007, and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order.  No trial date concerning APS’s water rights claims has been set in this matter.\n26\nTable of Contents\nAt this time, the lower court proceedings in the Gila River adjudication are in the process of determining the specific hydro-geologic testing protocols for determining which groundwater wells located outside of the subflow zone of the Gila River should be subject to the adjudication court’s jurisdiction.   A hearing to determine this jurisdictional test question was held in March 2018 in front of a special master, and a draft decision based on the evidence heard during that hearing was issued on May 17, 2018.  The decision of the special master, which was finalized on November 14, 2018, accepts the proposed hydro-geologic testing protocols supported by APS and other industrial users of groundwater.  A further ruling affirming this decision by the trial court judge overseeing the adjudication was issued on July 8, 2022.  Further proceedings have been initiated to determine the specific hydro-geologic testing protocols for subflow depletion determinations.  The determinations made in this final stage of the proceedings may ultimately govern the adjudication of rights for parties, such as APS, that rely on groundwater extraction to support their industrial operations.  APS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. \nLittle Colorado River Adjudication.\n  APS has filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed in Arizona in an action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court, which was originally filed on September 5, 1985.  APS’s groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and, therefore, is potentially at issue in the case.  APS’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights.  Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights.  No trial or pretrial proceedings have been scheduled for adjudication of APS’s water right claims.  The adjudication court is currently conducting a trial of federal reserved water right claims asserted by the Hopi Tribe and by the United States as trustee for the Tribe.  In addition, the adjudication court has established a schedule for consideration of separate federal reserved water right claims asserted by the Navajo Nation and by the United States as trustee for the Nation.  There is no established timeframe within which the adjudication court is expected to issue a final determination of water rights for the Hopi Tribe and the Navajo Nation, and any such final determination is likely to occur multiple years in the future.\nAlthough the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, APS does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company’s success depends on a strong human capital strategy including attracting, developing, and retaining a high-performing workforce.  We are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and engaging work environment that empowers all employees to reach their full potential.  Key human capital measures and objectives that drive our business strategy include employee safety, employee development, strong company culture based upon the APS Promise, strong talent pipelines, extensive learning and development focus, and succession planning.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe below table presents the employee count as of December 31, 2024: \n \nPrincipal Executive Office\nAddress\nYear of\nFormation\nApproximate\nNumber of\nEmployees at\nDecember 31, 2024\nPinnacle West\n400 North Fifth Street\nPhoenix, AZ 85004\n1985\n88 \nAPS\n400 North Fifth Street\nP.O. Box 53999\nPhoenix, AZ 85072-3999\n1920\n6,315 \n(a)\nEl Dorado\n400 North Fifth Street\nPhoenix, AZ 85004\n1983\n— \nPNW Power\n400 North Fifth Street\nPhoenix, AZ 85004\n2023\n— \nTotal\n \n \n6,403 \n \n(a)    Includes employees at jointly-owned generating facilities (approximately 2,300 employees) for which APS serves as the generating facility manager.\nApproximately 1,180 APS employees are union employees represented by International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”).  On September 25, 2023, the IBEW membership ratified a new collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with APS.  The new CBA became effective in October 2023 and has a duration of three years until April 1, 2026 and thereafter until either party gives notice of desire for change, amendment, or termination.  On August 23, 2024, 27 IT Communications Field Specialists joined the existing bargaining unit represented by IBEW.  Collective bargaining relating to these employees is ongoing.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCulture and Engagement\nThe APS Promise anchors our commitment to our customers, community, and each other.  The Promise explains our purpose, vision, and mission and the principles and behaviors that will empower us to achieve our strategic goals.  It represents the opportunity to build on our cultural strengths and develop new behaviors to enable our future success.  The APS Promise continues to be reinforced and integrated throughout our Company programs and messaging.\nWe evaluate our success in building this culture in part through annual and quarterly employee engagement surveys, including our Employee Experience Index, which measures key aspects of engagement such as recognition, career development, and organizational pride.  In 2024, we had 80% participation in these surveys, and our Employee Experience Index was 87%.  These surveys enable us to compare our performance to industry benchmarks and identify areas for improvement.\nBased on the survey results, we encourage business units and managers to take action.  For example, past surveys have led to initiatives that we believe improved communication, removed job success obstacles, increased employee access to leadership, and enhanced meeting efficiency.\nWe actively seek feedback from new hires to further refine the employee onboarding experience.  Our cross-functional Employee Engagement Council plays a key role in driving improvements, particularly in employee engagement and recognition.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that belonging matters.  We recognize that differences of identities, perspectives, and experiences is a key driver for our success.  Inclusion at the Company involves embracing the unique perspectives of each employee.  Examples of the Company’s efforts in this space include the following:\n•\nSupport for 11 employee networking groups to encourage employees to develop themselves, advance in their chosen field, and join a community;\n•\nExecutive listening sessions to provide employees with opportunities to be heard; and\n•\nAn optional self-paced module available to all employees that explains how cultural competence drives inclusion.\nEmployee Safety\nOur work and our decisions are anchored in safety – safety is the foundation of everything we do, and employee safety is our paramount responsibility as an employer.  We develop practices and programs that ensure employees have safe and secure workplaces that allow them to perform at the highest levels.  We utilize preventative programs like APS Moves to help keep our workforce healthy and prepare them to perform tasks safely.  Our comprehensive safety programs and our focus on human and organizational performance and injury case management contribute significantly to our strong safety performance.  As we continue to improve our safety performance, our ultimate goal remains serious injury reduction.  We believe our employees are empowered to speak up when there are better or safer ways of doing business.  Safety committees operate in organizations throughout the Company, providing opportunities for employees to positively impact their local safety cultures and performance.  Additionally, the Company’s executive safety committee helps ensure strong safety governance and operational integration across the enterprise and employee-led learning teams help ensure that lessons learned from close calls and other safety incidents are shared for the benefit of employees across the enterprise. \nTalent Strategy and Pipeline Development\nAttracting and developing a highly skilled workforce is critical to our success.  To this end, our talent strategy prioritizes the following:\n•\nCommitment to Growth and Development:\n We provide a wide range of professional development opportunities, including leadership academies, rotational programs, mentoring, industry certifications, and loaned executive programs.  In 2024, we ran dedicated programs for individual contributors, new leaders, and high potential managers.  We also launched an enterprise-wide on-demand learning platform to support a modern learning culture, with over 2,220 active users, encompassing engagement from every business unit and 5,650 hours of learning in 2024. \n•\nRobust Talent Pipelines:\n Our pipeline strategy focuses on attracting and developing early- and mid-career talent for critical energy sector positions, including lineworkers, substation electricians, cybersecurity specialists, engineers, and nuclear power plant operators and technicians.  We achieve this through an array of programs, including craft apprenticeships, engineering and rotational programs, and internships.  We partner closely with educational institutions and organizations to build a talent-ready pool for these critical roles. \n•\nStrategic Partnerships:\n We leverage partnerships with colleges, universities, vocational schools, and the Department of Defense SkillBridge program to access a wide pool of qualified candidates, including transitioning military personnel.\n30\nTable of Contents\n•\nInnovation in Talent Acquisition:\n Palo Verde expanded its internship programs in 2024 to include nuclear operations, further strengthening our talent pipeline for the critically important licensed and non-licensed operators.\nThese initiatives contribute to a high-performing and engaged workforce that supports the long-term success of our Company.\nSuccession Planning\nSuccession planning is critical to ensuring the long-term success of our Company.  We have a robust process for identifying and developing high-potential leaders to fill key executive and other critical roles.  This involves regularly reviewing and updating succession plans for key positions, identifying and assessing potential successors, and providing targeted development opportunities such as mentoring, coaching, and challenging rotational assignments.  We also evaluate leadership potential through assessments, performance reviews, and 360-degree feedback.  We collaborate with senior leadership to build a pipeline of qualified internal and external candidates and continuously adapt our succession planning process to meet evolving business needs and industry trends.\nTotal Rewards Strategy\nRecognizing that our employees are among our most valuable assets, we have developed a comprehensive Total Rewards strategy to attract, engage, and retain a high-performing workforce.  Our Total Rewards program encompasses a comprehensive suite of offerings, including competitive compensation, a robust benefits package, retirement savings plans, professional development opportunities, recognition programs, and a focus on employee well-being.  This holistic approach aims to (1) attract and retain top talent by offering a competitive and attractive compensation and benefits package, (2) support employee well-being by promoting a healthy work-life balance and providing resources to support employee physical, mental, and financial well-being, (3) foster employee engagement and motivation through recognition programs, professional development opportunities, and a strong emphasis on career growth, and (4) enhance employee satisfaction by creating a rewarding and fulfilling work experience for all employees.  We continuously evaluate and refine our Total Rewards program to ensure it remains competitive, relevant, and responsive to the evolving needs and expectations of our employees.\nBUSINESS OF OTHER SUBSIDIARIES\nPNW Power\nOn August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary BCE to Ameresco (the “BCE Sale”).\n \nThe transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business and closed in multiple stages.\n  T\nhe final closing of the BCE Sale was completed on January 12, 2024.\n \nSee Note 20 for additional details.  Certain investments and assets that BCE previously held, including the TransCanyon joint venture and holdings in the two Tenaska wind farm investments, were not included in the BCE Sale and were instead transferred to PNW Power, a Delaware limited liability corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West. \nPNW Power’s investments include TransCanyon, a 50/50 joint venture that was formed in 2014 with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  TransCanyon is pursuing independent electric transmission opportunities within the 11 U.S. states that comprise the Western Interconnection, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be \n31\nTable of Contents\nprovided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates.  The U.S. DOE’s Grid Deployment Office selected TransCanyon to enter into capacity contract negotiations for up to 25% of the Cross-Tie 500-kilovolt transmission line (“Cross-Tie”) as part of the Transmission Facilitation Program.

This discussion provides a comparison of the 2024 results with 2023 results.  For the discussion of 2023 compared to 2022, see Part II. Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which specific discussion is incorporated herein by reference.  For information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate, see “Forward-Looking Statements” at the front of this report and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.\nOVERVIEW\n \nBusiness Overview \nPinnacle West is an investor-owned electric utility holding company based in Phoenix, Arizona with consolidated assets of approximately $26 billion.\n \nSince 1886, Pinnacle West and our affiliates have provided energy and energy-related products to people and businesses throughout Arizona. \nPinnacle West derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary, APS.\n \nAPS is Arizona’s largest and longest-serving electric company that generates safe, affordable and reliable electricity for approximately 1.4 million retail customers in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties.\n \nAPS is also the operator and co-owner of Palo Verde — a primary source of electricity for the southwestern United States.\n \nStrategic Overview \nOur strategy is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona that delivers shareholder value and shared value by serving our customers with reliable, affordable, and clean energy.\nCustomer-Focused\nAPS’s focus remains on its customers and the communities it serves.  Accordingly, it is APS’s goal to achieve an industry-leading, best-in-class customer experience.  This multi-year objective includes incrementally improving APS’s J.D. Power (“JDP”) residential and business customer satisfaction ratings from the fourth to the top of second quartile for its customers.  For 2024, APS ranked at the top of the second quartile for large investor-owned utilities for both business and residential customers, with the residential results being APS’s highest rank and placement since 2016.\nIn furtherance of a customer-centric culture, APS employees have delivered an enhanced customer experience in recent years through a number of past and ongoing initiatives, such as improving the ease-of-use of APS’s automated phone system, improving the speed of answering customer calls, advancing phone advisor soft skill development through updated training curriculum, and adding 1,100-plus in-person payment locations, as well as introducing new customer payment channels.  Recently, APS redesigned its customer bills with the aim of increasing personalization and helping customers better understand their \n57\nTable of Contents \nenergy use and find ways to save.  APS also implemented numerous enhancements to its website, including improving page-loading speeds, adding user-friendly dashboards, and making content more simple, relevant, and useful.  APS enhanced other customer touchpoints, such as communications throughout outages and the online outage center in addition to continuing to communicate with customers in their preferred channels about topics that matter most to them, such as reliability, energy-efficiency, financial assistance, the environment, and programs that enable them to design their own personalized energy experience.  Finally, APS continues to focus on employee learning, training, tools, and resources to ensure all employees understand their role in APS customers’ experiences.\nAdditionally, APS has implemented a variety of financial assistance programs to support customers struggling to pay their energy bills.  Among these assistance programs are discounts for qualified limited-income customers, including a new tier with larger discounts for APS’s lowest income customers added in the second quarter of 2024 and other non-income-based assistance programs, such as flexible payment arrangements and emergency utility bill assistance.  To ensure our most vulnerable customers are connected to these programs, we train and partner with more than one hundred community action agencies across our service territory.\nReliable\nWhile our energy mix evolves, APS’s commitment to deliver reliable service to our customers remains.\n \nAPS is managing through significant growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area while experiencing supply chain issues similar to those experienced in other industries.\n \nPlanned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid, updating technology, accommodating customer growth, and enabling more renewable energy resources.\n \nTo prioritize reliability and meet substantial growth in customer energy needs, APS has developed a future-focused, strategic transmission plan (the “Ten-Year Transmission Plan”).\n \nThe Ten-Year Transmission Plan includes five critical transmission projects that comprise the APS strategic transmission portfolio, which represent a significant upgrade to our transmission system.\n \nThese five projects, along with other projects included in the Ten-Year Transmission Plan, will support growing energy needs, strengthen reliability, and allow for the connection of new resources.\nOur advanced distribution management system allows operators to locate outages and control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid.\n \nThe system will also integrate a new meter data management system that will increase grid visibility and give customers access to more of their energy usage data. \nWildfire safety remains a critical focus for APS and other utilities.  We have increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure, continue ongoing system upgrades, build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities.  We also increased spend on mitigating the risk associated with trees that could cause hazards, resulting in more of these trees being removed before they could cause outages or wildfires.  These programs contribute to customer reliability, responsible forest management and safe communities.  With recent wildfire events in Hawaii, California, and across North America, we have been devoting and will continue to devote substantial efforts to analyzing and developing enhancements to our systems and processes to mitigate fire risk within our service territory and communities, including by hardening our infrastructure, deploying new technologies where appropriate, increasing our awareness, implementing operational changes, and enhancing our wildfire response capabilities.  APS completed implementation of fire modelling software that we are utilizing to more surgically identify and calculate risk and target future \n58\nTable of Contents \nsystem improvement investments such as fire-resistant pole wrapping, wood to steel pole conversions, and additional remote-controllable field devices like reclosers and switches.  In 2024, APS began installing a system of artificial intelligence-based fire sensing cameras with the ability to detect and alert on fire ignitions.  These alerts are sent both to APS and fire response dispatch centers to speed fire response in APS’s service territory regardless of the cause of the fire.  APS also implemented a PSPS program on certain feeders that began in the 2024 fire season, leveraging the additional real-time analysis provided by the new modelling software, and has educated and is continuing education outreach to customers and communities that may potentially be impacted by the PSPS program.  APS continues to evaluate policy and regulatory options, as well as insurance programs, to mitigate the impact of wildfire events.\nFor example, on August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  See Note 3 for more information.  \nAdditionally, APS was selected by the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office (“GDO”) to receive up to $70 million in federal money for fire mitigation and grid infrastructure projects.  This funding is part of the GDO’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership Program and is contingent on APS negotiating and executing final grant agreements with GDO.\nMaintaining reliability and affordability for customers during the clean energy transition is fundamental to APS’s strategy.\n  Dispatchable natural gas generators provide energy during times when intermittent resources, such as solar and wind, are insufficient to meet customer demand.  \nIn addition to the previously added natural gas units at the modernized Ocotillo Power Plant in 2019 and efficiency improvements to gas units at the Redhawk, Sundance, and West Phoenix Power Plants in 2024, APS has contracted for two simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 90 MW in total) at Sundance, which are expected to be in service in 2026, and eight simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 397 MW in total) at Redhawk, which are expected to be in service in 2028.\n \nAPS continues to evaluate and pursue options for reliably serving growing customer energy needs and demand.\nIn October 2021, APS announced plans to evaluate regional market solutions as part of the Western Markets Exploratory Group (“WMEG”).\n \nAs a member of WMEG, APS explored the potential for a staged approach to new market services, including day-ahead energy sales, transmission system expansion, and other power supply and grid solutions consistent with existing regulations and known and expected market design.  APS utilizes the work done by WMEG to help identify market solutions that can help achieve carbon reduction goals while supporting reliable, affordable service for customers.\nAPS went live with a new Energy Management System (“EMS”) in April 2024.  APS expects the new EMS to provide a better foundation which will improve future integration of the renewable and energy storage assets into APS’s generation resource portfolio, allowing APS to maximize the flexibility of its resources and fully engage in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (“WEIM”).\n \nAPS also believes it will better position APS to participate in market opportunities that develop over the next decade.\nAPS’s key elements to delivering reliable power include resource and transmission planning, sufficient reserve margins, partnering with customers to manage peak demand, fire mitigation, and operational preparedness, among others.  Seasonal readiness procedures at APS include inspections to ensure good material conditions and critical control system surveys.  APS also plans for the unexpected by conducting emergency operations drills and coordinating with federal, state, and local agencies on fire and emergency management.\n59\nTable of Contents \nAffordable \nAPS continues to focus on mitigating the cost pressures related to inflation and other factors, such as tariffs.\n \nOverall inflation grew by 1.6% in Phoenix and 2.9% nationally over the twelve months ended December 2024.  Although inflationary impacts to APS began to slow in 2024, APS is still managing the impacts high inflation.  Additionally, the implementation of recent and future tariffs could further escalate costs and introduce supply chain constraints.\nAPS’s customer affordability initiative includes internal opportunities, such as training and mentoring employees on identifying efficiency opportunities; maintaining an inventory to take advantage of lower pricing and avoid expediting fees; entering into long-term contracts to hedge against price volatility, which has allowed APS to mitigate against procurement spend areas such as transformers; and implementing automation technologies to enhance efficiencies and increase data-oriented decision making.\nThere are also external opportunities under APS’s customer affordability initiative, such as APS’s participation in the WEIM.  WEIM continues to be a tool for creating savings for APS’s customers from the real-time, voluntary market.  APS continues to expect that its participation in WEIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS’s renewable resources.  APS participated in market design and tariff development of Markets+, a day-ahead and real-time market offering from Southwest Power Pool (“SPP”).  The Markets+ tariff was filed with FERC on March 29, 2024 and was approved on January 16, 2025.  APS announced a market decision to pursue participation in SPP Markets+.  In addition, APS is participating in the Western Resource Adequacy Program administered by Western Power Pool and is transitioning to full binding participation as early as summer 2027.  These regional efforts are driven by the objectives of reducing customer cost and improving reliability.\nIn terms of generation affordability, every three years, APS performs a comprehensive study, called an Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), to identify what resources will be necessary to safely and reliably meet the demand and energy needs of its customers over the next 15 years.\n \nIn November 2023, APS released its latest IRP, which identified forecasted customer demand and energy needs growing at an unprecedented rate.\n \nIn developing the IRP, APS considered how factors such as forecasted economic growth, impacts from weather, and new resource technology availability impact the amount and type of resources required to reliably meet customer needs.\n \nThese factors, among others, were used to develop a plan that identified a balanced mix of diverse energy generating resources to reliably serve customers’ future energy needs in the most affordable and sustainable manner possible.  To help ensure competitive costs for resources procured by APS, APS regularly issues competitive bid solicitations through the ASRFP process, with the most recent ASRFPs being issued in 2022, 2023, and 2024.  These ASRFPs are open to bids for all resource types, including customer-scale (behind the meter) and utility-scale (in front of the meter) resources.  Through the ASRFP process, APS has found that clean resources like wind, solar, and energy storage technology, are important elements of a least cost portfolio.\n \n During the clean energy transition, dispatchable resources will play a vital role in maintaining grid reliability by serving as a back-up to intermittent energy resources when output is insufficient to meet customer needs.  Over the long term, each resource in a balanced and diverse portfolio is expected to provide complementary value and contribute to sustained delivery of reliable electric service.\n \nIn addition to managing the cost of electricity generation, APS has continued building upon existing cost management efforts, including a customer affordability initiative launched in 2019.\n \nThe initiative was implemented company-wide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our business processes \n60\nTable of Contents \nand organizational approaches to completing high-value work and achieving internal efficiencies.\n \nAPS continues to drive this initiative by identifying opportunities to streamline its business processes, mitigate cost increases, increase employee retention, and improve customer satisfaction.\nClean Energy Commitment\nWe are committed to doing our part to build a clean and carbon-free future.\n \nAs Arizona stewards, we do what is right for the people and prosperity of Arizona.\n \nOur vision is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona by providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy to our customers.\n \nWe can accomplish our vision by collaborating with customers, communities, employees, policymakers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n \nOur clean energy commitment is based on sound science and supports continued growth and economic development while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for APS’s customers.\nAPS’s clean energy commitment consists of three parts: \n•\nA 2050 goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity;\n•\nA 2030 target to achieve a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and\n•\nA plan to exit from coal-fired generation by 2031.\nAPS’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment depends upon a number of important external factors, including a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, development of clean energy technologies, and continued access to capital markets, among others.\n2050 Goal: 100% Clean, Carbon-Free Electricity.\n \nAchieving a fully clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration.\n \nAchieving this 2050 goal will require, among other things, innovative thinking, emergent clean energy and storage technologies, upgrades and expansions to the grid, and supportive public policy.\n2030 Goal: 65% Clean Energy.\n \nAPS has an energy mix that is already more than 50% clean and plans to continue to add more renewables and energy storage.\n \nBy building on those plans, APS intends to attain an energy mix that is 65% clean by 2030, with 45% of APS’s generation portfolio coming from renewable energy.\n \n“Clean” is measured as percent of energy mix, which includes all carbon-free resources like nuclear, renewables, and demand-side management.\n \n“Renewable” energy includes generation resources such as solar, wind, and biomass, and is measured in accordance with the ACC Renewable Energy Standard as a percentage of retail sales.\n \nThis target will serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning, investment strategy, and customer affordability efforts as APS moves toward a 100% clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050.\n2031 Goal: Exit Coal-Fired Generation.\n \nThe plan to exit coal-fired generation by 2031 will require APS to stop relying on coal-generation at Four Corners.\n \nAPS has permanently retired more than 1,000 MW of coal-fired electric generating capacity.\n \nThese closures and other measures taken by APS have resulted in annual carbon emissions that were 36% lower in 2023 compared to 2005.\n \nIn addition, APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla units during 2025.\nIn June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners as early as fall 2023, subject to the \n61\nTable of Contents \nnecessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership.\n \nUnder seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons where electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter and spring.\n \nThe other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages.\n  As of the date of this report, \nAPS has elected not to begin seasonal operation due to market conditions.\nRenewables.\n  APS’s IRP identifies a diverse mix of resources adequate to maintain grid reliability while serving increasing future customer energy needs.\n \nOur IRP shows that renewable and clean resources are an important part of a reliable, cost effective portfolio.  APS seeks market-based pricing of procured resources through regular solicitation of project bids using its competitive ASRFP process.\nAPS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned resources, including solar, wind, energy storage, nuclear, geothermal, biomass and biogas, that supports our commitment to clean energy.  This commitment is already strengthened by Palo Verde, one of the nation’s largest carbon-free, clean energy resources, which provides the foundation for reliable and affordable service for APS customers.  APS’s longer-term clean energy strategy includes pursuing the right mix of purchased power contracts for new resources, procurement of new resources to be owned by APS, and the ongoing development of distributed energy resources.  Maintaining a balanced and diverse portfolio of resources will ensure continued reliable service to our customers in the most affordable manner possible.\nAPS uses competitive ASRFPs to pursue market-priced resources that meet its system needs and offer the best value for customers.\n \nAPS selects projects based on cost, ability to meet system requirements and commercial viability, taking into consideration timing and likelihood of successful contracting and development.\n \nUnder current market conditions, APS must aggressively contract for resources that can withstand supply chain and other geopolitical pressures.\n \nGuided by IRP-established timelines and quantities, APS maintains a flexible approach that allows it to optimize system reliability and customer affordability through the ASRFP process.\n \nAgreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection to the electric grid.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS issued an ASRFP (the “2023 ASRFP”) pursuant to which\n \nAPS procured nearly 7,300 MW of new resources to be in service from 2026 to 2028.\nOn November 20, 2024, APS issued an ASRFP (the “2024 ASRFP”) seeking 2,000 MW of resources.  APS is seeking projects that can reach commercial operation beginning June 1, 2028 through June 1, 2030 but will consider projects that may achieve commercial operation as early as 2026.  Additionally, APS is interested in projects that require longer planning, permitting, and construction and can be commercially operational after June 1, 2030.  Bids for the 2024 ASRFP were due on February 5, 2025.\n62\nTable of Contents \nThe following table summarizes the resources in APS’s renewable energy portfolio that are in operation, planned or under development as of the date of this report.

APS has been monitoring emerging nuclear technologies, such as small modular nuclear reactors (“SMRs”).  SMRs are typically designed to generate 300 MW or less of energy per unit compared to, for example, the 1,400 MW per unit generated at Palo Verde.  The utilities have applied for a grant from the DOE to begin preliminary exploration of a potential site for additional nuclear energy for Arizona.  The grant could support a three-year site selection process and possible preparation of an early site permit application to NRC. \nElectric Vehicles\n \nAs a part of the statewide transportation electrification plan (“TE Plan”) adopted in 2021, the ACC approved a target of 450,000 light-duty electric vehicles (“EVs”) in APS’s service territory by 2030.  APS’s Take Charge AZ (“TCAZ”) program has helped to deploy Level 2 EV charging stations on customer properties for fleet, public, and workplace EV charging.  As of December 31, 2024, APS has installed 829 energized Level 2 charging ports at 197 customer locations.  Additionally, APS has energized direct current fast charging stations that are owned and operated by APS at five locations in Arizona: Sedona, Prescott, Globe, Show Low, and Payson.  Effective December 12, 2023, the TCAZ program was discontinued by the ACC.  As part of that decision, APS was permitted to complete certain projects that were in process as of December 12, 2023.\nAdditionally, as part of APS’s DSM Implementation Plan, APS launched the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot to proactively address the growing electric demand from charging as EVs become more widely adopted.  The EV programs in the DSM Implementation Plan include APS SmartCharge (an EV data gathering program), Fleet Advisory Services, and a $100 rebate to home builders for new homes to be built EV-ready with 240V receptacle.  APS previously offered a $250 residential rebate to customers that purchased a qualifying home Level 2 charger.  Effective December 12, 2023, APS discontinued this rebate per the ACC decision.  See the discussion above. \nAPS filed its 2024 DSM Implementation Plan on November 30, 2023.  The 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes APS’s 2024 TE Plan and, among other things, proposes two new programs that were initially proposed in the 2023 DSM Implementation Plan: an expanded residential EV Managed Charging program and a Commercial EV Make-Ready Program.  On April 26, 2024, APS filed an amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  The amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes an updated budget of $90.9 million to reflect removal of incentive funds for the Level 2 Smart Charger rebate within the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot, an update on the performance incentive calculation, and the withdrawal of tranches two and three of the residential battery pilot.  The amended 2024 DSM Plan is still pending ACC review and approval.  APS will not file a 2025 DSM Implementation Plan, pending ACC review of the amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\n64\nTable of Contents \nCarbon Capture\nCarbon Capture Utilization and Storage (“CCUS”) technologies can isolate CO\n2\n and either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products.\n \nCurrently, almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen.\n \nCCUS technologies are still in the demonstration phase and while they show promise, they are still being tested in real-world conditions.\n \nThese technologies could offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired.\n \nAPS will continue to monitor this emerging technology.\nSustainability Practices\nIn 2020, in support of our clean energy commitment and the growing focus on sustainability within our organization, we increased our focus on sustainability by dedicating a new Sustainability Department at Pinnacle West responsible for integrating responsible business practices into the everyday work of the Company.\nIn 2024, the Sustainability Department engaged an external consultant and leveraged input from employees, large customers, limited-income advocates, economic development groups, tribes, nonprofits, environmental non-governmental organizations, residential customers, and other stakeholders to identify and assess the sustainability issues that matter most.  In total, 15 Priority Sustainability Issues (“PSIs”) were identified and prioritized.  The top five issues that were prioritized by stakeholders are as follows: energy affordability, electric reliability, clean energy and decarbonization, workforce development, and climate resilience and adaptation.  Understanding the sustainability priorities of internal and external stakeholders can help companies improve performance, identify risks and opportunities, and refine sustainability strategy. \nFinally, the Company maintains an annual Corporate Responsibility Report on the Pinnacle West website (\nwww.pinnaclewest.com/corporate-responsibility\n).\n \nThe report provides information related to the Company’s sustainability practices and performance.\n \nThe information on Pinnacle West’s website, including the Corporate Responsibility Report, is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report.\nArtificial Intelligence\nTo address the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology risks and opportunities, APS has developed a cross functional governance structure with leadership and experts from our information technology, cybersecurity, human resources, ethics, supply chain, legal, and nuclear generation teams.\n \nThis cross functional structure assesses the opportunities and risks in alignment with enterprise strategy to ensure compliance with data security and reliability requirements as well as our Code of Ethical Conduct, while observing market trends in this rapidly evolving area.\nRegulatory Overview\nAPS expects to file an application with the ACC for its next general rate case mid-year 2025 and is continuing to evaluate the timing of such filing.\n65\nTable of Contents \n2022 Retail Rate Case\nAPS filed an application with the ACC on October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Rate Case”) seeking an increase in annual retail base rates.\nOn January 25, 2024, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO in the 2022 Rate Case, as corrected on February 6, 2024 (the “2022 Rate Case ROO”).  The 2022 Rate Case ROO recommended, among other things, (i) a $523.1 million increase in the annual base rate revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55% return on equity, (iii) a 0.25% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.36%, (v) 12 months of post-test year plant and the inclusion of the Four Corners Effluent Limitations Guideline (“ELG”) project, (vi) the approval of APS’s System Reliability Benefit (“SRB”) proposal with certain procedural and other modifications, (vii) no additional Coal Community Transition (“CCT”) funding, (viii) a 5.0% return on the prepaid pension asset and a return of 5.35% on the OPEB liability, and (ix) no disallowances on APS’s coal contracts.  \nThe 2022 Rate Case ROO also recommended a number of changes to existing adjustors, including (i) the approval of modified DSM performance incentives and the requested DSM transfer to base rates, (ii) the retention of $1.9 million of Renewable Energy Adjustment Charge (“REAC”) in the adjustor rather than base rates, (iii) a partial transfer of $27.1 million of LFCR funds to base rates, and (iv) the adoption of an increase in the annual PSA cap to $0.006/kWh.  \nOn February 22, 2024, the ACC approved a number of amendments to the 2022 Rate Case ROO that resulted in, among other things, (i) an approximately $491.7 million increase in the annual base revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55% return on equity, (iii) a 0.25% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.39%, (v) a return set at the Company’s weighted average cost of capital on the net prepaid pension asset and net other post-employment benefit liability in rate base, (vi) an adjustment to generation maintenance and outage expense  to reflect a more reasonable level of test year costs, (vii) approval of the SRB mechanism with modifications to customer notifications, procedural timelines and the inclusion of any qualifying technology and fuel source bid received through an ASRFP, and (viii) recovery of all DSM costs through the DSM Adjustment Charge (“DSMAC”) rather than through base rates.\nThe ACC’s decision results in an expected total net annual revenue increase for APS of approximately $253.4 million and a roughly 8% increase to the typical residential customer’s bill.\n \nThe ACC issued the final order for the 2022 Rate Case on March 5, 2024, with the new rates becoming effective for all service rendered on or after March 8, 2024.\nSix intervenors and the Attorney General of Arizona requested rehearing on various issues included in the ACC’s decision, such as the grid access charge (“GAC”) for solar customers, the SRB, and CCT funding.  On April 15, 2024, the ACC granted, in part, the rehearing applications of the Attorney General, Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, Solar Energy Industries Association, and Vote Solar specifically to review whether the GAC rate is just and reasonable, including whether it should be higher or lower, whether the GAC rate constitutes a discriminatory fee to solar customers, and whether omission of a GAC charge is discriminatory to non-solar customers.  All other applications for rehearing were denied.    A limited rehearing was held October 28 through November 1.  Following the limited rehearing, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO (the “Limited Rehearing ROO”) on December 3, 2024.  The Limited Rehearing ROO recommended affirming the GAC as just and reasonable and that the GAC is not discriminatory to solar customers and the absence of a GAC is not discriminatory to non-solar customers.  On December 17, 2024, the ACC approved the Limited Rehearing ROO with an amendment that requires \n66\nTable of Contents \nAPS in its next rate case to propose a revenue allocation based on a site-load cost of service study in order to bring further parity in revenue collection between solar and non-solar customers.  SEIA, AriSEIA, Vote Solar, the Arizona Attorney General, and two individual customers have filed requests for rehearing of the Commission’s December 17, 2024 decision on the rehearing.  The Commission has taken no action on these requests.  In addition, each of these parties have subsequently filed notices of appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals seeking review of the Commission’s decisions regarding the GAC and on rehearing.  APS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\n2019 Retail Rate Case\nOn October 31, 2019, APS filed an application with the ACC (the “2019 Rate Case”) for an annual increase in retail base rates.\n \nOn August 2, 2021, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO in the 2019 Rate Case (the “2019 Rate Case ROO”) and issued corrections on September 10 and September 20, 2021. \n \nSubsequently, the ACC approved an amended 2019 Rate Case ROO on November 2, 2021. \nAfter the 2019 Rate Case decision, APS filed an application for rehearing of the 2019 Rate Case and later filed a Notice of Direct Appeal by APS at the Arizona Court of Appeals, requesting review of certain matters from the 2019 Rate Case decision.\n \nThe Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the ACC’s decision in the 2019 Rate Case, remanding the issue to the ACC for further proceedings.\n \nOn June 14, 2023, APS and the ACC Legal Division filed a joint resolution with the ACC to allow recovery of $215.5 million in costs related to the installation of the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) project, a reversal of the 20 basis points reduction to APS’s return on equity from 8.9% to 8.7% as a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, and recovery of $59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023.\n \nThe joint resolution provides for a new Court Resolution Surcharge (“CRS”) mechanism, which is designed to recover the $59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and\n \nJune 20, 2023, and the prospective recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments and expense and the allowable return on equity difference in current base rates.\n \nOn   June 21, 2023, the ACC approved the joint resolution and proposals therein for recovery through the CRS mechanism, which became effective on July 1, 2023.  As of December 31, 2024, $26.2 million \nof the $59.6 million of lost revenue has been recovered.  \nFinally, the CRS tariff has been updated to account for changes to return on equity and depreciation and deferral adjustments approved in Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case.\nRegulatory Lag Docket\nOn January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC’s historical test year rules.  The ACC requested comments and held two workshops exploring ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years, hybrid test years, and formula rates.  On December 3, 2024, the ACC approved a policy statement regarding formula rate plans.  The policy statement allows regulated utilities to propose formula rate plans in future rate cases.  Proposed plans must be based on a historical test year, include an annual update with a true-up and an earnings test to ensure a utility earns within a 20 basis points band of its authorized return on equity.  Proposed plans should also include an annual meeting and challenge periods for stakeholder feedback.  Utilities that implement formula rates also must file a full rate case at least every five years unless an alternate schedule is set by the ACC.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n67\nTable of Contents \nCholla\nOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order associated with unrecovered book value and closure costs of the remaining Cholla units.  This order would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, both the expenses necessary to close and decommission coal-fired power plant infrastructure at Cholla, including legally required site environmental remediation, CCR corrective actions, the closure of CCR management facilities, and any unrecovered plant investment and operating costs incurred through and after April 2025.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nFire Mitigation\nOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nSee Note 3 for information regarding additional regulatory matters.\nCaptive Insurance Cell \nPinnacle West is the primary beneficiary of\n \na protected cell captive insurance company.  The Captive provides insurance coverage to Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries that supplements third-party insurance policies. \n \nThe Captive insures Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries for terrorism coverage, excess liability including certain wildfire coverage, excess property insurance, and excess employment practice liability.  The Captive policies exclude nuclear liability at Palo Verde.  See Note 10. \n \nThe Captive may hold investment assets in cash, cash equivalents, and equity and fixed income instruments. \nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) significantly expands the availability of tax credits for investments in clean energy generation technologies and energy storage.\n \nKey provisions that are relevant to APS’s clean energy commitment include (i) an extension of tax credits for solar and wind generation, including a new option for solar investments to claim a Production Tax Credit (\n“\nPTC\n”\n) in lieu of the Investment Tax Credit (\n“\nITC\n”\n) beginning in 2022; (ii) expansion of the ITC to cover stand-alone energy storage technology beginning in 2023; (iii) introduction of technology neutral clean energy ITCs and PTCs beginning in 2025; and (iv) introduction of a new PTC for nuclear energy produced by existing nuclear energy plants, available from 2024 through 2032.\n \nThe Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury Department have issued preliminary guidance related to various provisions of the IRA that have enabled APS to claim credits related to its solar and energy storage investments.\n \nThe Company continues to await regulations and other guidance, including with respect to the nuclear PTC, which will provide additional details and clarifications regarding how the Company may be able to claim IRA tax credits.  See Note 4 for more information. \nThe prospects for federal tax reform, including potential modification or repeal of the IRA tax provisions, have increased due to the results of the 2024 election.  Any such reform may impact the availability of future potential tax benefits from the IRA and could impact the Company’s effective tax rate, cash taxes paid and other financial results such as earnings per share, gross revenues, and cash flows.  We cannot predict the timing or extent of such tax-related developments which, absent appropriate regulatory treatment, may have a negative impact on our financial results.\n68\nTable of Contents \nFinancial Strength and Flexibility\nPinnacle West and APS currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company.  Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.\nOther Subsidiaries\nPNW Power\n.\n \n \nOn August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary BCE to Ameresco (the “BCE Sale”).\n \nThe transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business and closed in multiple stages.\n  T\nhe final closing of the BCE Sale was completed on January 12, 2024.  See Note 20 for additional details.  Certain investments and assets that BCE previously held, including the TransCanyon joint venture and holdings in the two Tenaska wind farm investments, were not included in the BCE Sale and were instead transferred to PNW Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.\nPNW Power’s investments include TransCanyon, a 50/50 joint venture that was formed in 2014 with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  TransCanyon is pursuing independent electric transmission opportunities within the 11 U.S. states that comprise the Western Interconnection, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates.  The U.S. Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office selected TransCanyon to enter into capacity contract negotiations for up to 25% of the Cross-Tie 500-kilovolt transmission line (“Cross-Tie”) as part of the Transmission Facilitation Program.  The agreement was executed on June 12, 2024.  The proposed Cross-Tie project includes a 214-mile transmission line connecting Utah and Nevada that is intended to help improve grid reliability and relieve congestion on other transmission lines.\nPNW Power’s investments also include minority ownership positions in two wind farms operated by Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska Energy Holdings, LLC, the 242 MW Clear Creek and the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind farms.\n \nClear Creek achieved commercial operation in May 2020; however, in the fourth quarter of 2022, PNW Power’s equity method investment was fully impaired.\n \nNobles 2 achieved commercial operation in December 2020.\n \nBoth wind farms deliver power under long-term PPAs.\n \nPNW Power indirectly owns 9.9% of Clear Creek and 5.1% of Nobles 2.\nEl Dorado\n.\n \nEl Dorado is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.  El Dorado owns debt investments and minority interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona community-based ventures.  In particular, El Dorado has committed to the following:\n•\n$25 million investment in the Energy Impact Partners fund, of which approximately $18.8 million has been funded as of December 31, 2024.  Energy Impact Partners is an organization that focuses on fostering innovation and supporting the transformation of the utility industry.  \n•\n$25 million investment in AZ-VC (formerly invisionAZ Fund), of which approximately $11.8 million has been funded as of December 31, 2024.  AZ-VC is a fund focused on analyzing, investing, managing, and otherwise dealing with investments in privately-held early stage and emerging growth technology companies and businesses primarily based in Arizona, or based in \n69\nTable of Contents \nother jurisdictions and having existing or potential strategic or economic ties to companies or other interests in Arizona.  \n•\n$7.5 million investment in Westly Seed Fund, of which approximately $1.2 million has been funded as of December 31, 2024.  Westly Seed Fund is focused on supporting entrepreneurs involved in the energy, mobility, building, and industrial sectors.\n•\nEquity investment in SAI Advanced Power Solutions (“SAI”), a private corporation that manufactures electrical switchgear equipment used by data centers.  El Dorado accounts for this investment under the equity method, with a December 31, 2024 investment carrying value of zero.  SAI has seen an increased demand for their customized switchgear products.  El Dorado has no funding commitments to SAI.\nThe remainder of these investment commitments will be contributed by El Dorado as each investment fund selects and makes investments.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \nIn addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above, many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook, including those listed below.  We closely monitor these factors to plan for the Company’s current needs, and to adjust our expectations, financial budgets and forecasts appropriately.\n \nElectric Operating Revenues.\n \nFor the years 2022 through 2024, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 92% of our total operating revenues.\n \nOur electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline, variations in weather from period to period, customer mix, average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, distributed energy additions, electricity rates and tariffs, the recovery of PSA deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms.\n \nThese revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions, including competition, demand, and prices.\n \nActual and Projected Customer and Sales Growth.\n \nRetail customers in APS’s service territory increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period.  For the three years through 2024, APS’s customer growth averaged 2.1% per year.  We currently project annual customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% for 2025 and the average annual growth to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2027 based on anticipated steady population growth in Arizona during that period.\nRetail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period.  While steady customer growth was somewhat offset by weaker usage among residential customers, energy savings driven by customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong sales to commercial and industrial customers and the ramp-up of new data center and large manufacturing customers.\nFor the three years through 2024, annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 3.2%, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations.  Due to the expected growth of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% for 2025 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% through 2027, including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable \n70\nTable of Contents \ngeneration initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations.  These projected sales growth ranges include the impacts of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, which are expected to contribute to 2025 growth in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% and to average annual growth in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2027. \nLonger term, APS has been preparing for and can serve significant load growth from residential and business customers.  On top of these existing growth trends, APS is also now receiving unprecedented incremental requests for service from extra-large commercial energy users (over 25 MW) with very high energy demands that persist virtually around-the-clock.  These incremental requests for service by extra-large energy users far exceed available generation and transmission resource capacity in the Southwest region for the foreseeable future.  In April 2023, APS notified prospective extra-large customers without existing commitments from APS that it is not able to commit at this time to future extra-large projects of over 25 MW.  Because of the high growth in demand for such projects, APS has developed a prioritization queue that identifies and prioritizes projects while maintaining system reliability and affordability for existing APS customers.  APS is exploring available options for securing sufficient electric generation and transmission to meet these projections of future customer needs.\nActual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and energy conservation, slower ramp-up of and/or fewer data centers and large manufacturing facilities, slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions, impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in DG, responses to retail price changes, changes in regulatory standards, and impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations.  Based on past experience, a 1% variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $24 million, and a 1% variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $6 million.\nWeather.\n \nIn forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above, we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data.\n \nOur experience indicates that typical variations from normal weather can result in increases and decreases in annual net income of up to $20 million.  However, since 2020, extreme weather events, such as record-setting summer heat and decreased annual precipitation in our service territory, have resulted in increases in annual net income that are more than historically typical, on average.\n \nFuel and Purchased Power Costs.\n \nFuel and purchased power costs included on our Consolidated Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas, changes in our generation resource allocation, our hedging program for managing such costs and PSA deferrals and the related amortization.\nOperations and Maintenance Expenses\n. \n \nOperations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), inflation, unplanned outages, planned outages (typically scheduled in the spring and fall), renewable energy and DSM related expenses (which are mostly offset by the same amount of operating revenues) and other factors. \n71\nTable of Contents \nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses.\n \nDepreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), and increases in intangible assets and changes in depreciation and amortization rates.\n \nSee “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities.\n \n \nPension and Other Postretirement Non-Service Credits, Net\n.\n \nPension and other postretirement non-service credits can be impacted by changes in our actuarial assumptions.\n \nThe most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our net periodic costs/credit, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term, the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates.\n \nWe review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.  See Note 7.\nProperty Taxes.\n  Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are affected by changes in plant balances related to new investments and improvements to existing facilities, the value of property in service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax rates. \n \nThe average property tax rate in Arizona for APS, which owns essentially all of our property, was 9.7% of the assessed value for 2024, 10.0% for 2023, and 10.2% for 2022.  Property taxes increased in 2024 due to higher plant balances related to expansion and improvements on our existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, partially offset by legislative changes reducing both property tax assessment ratios and rates in Arizona.  \n \nIncome Taxes\n.\n  Income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income, income tax rates, certain deductions, and non-taxable items, such as AFUDC.  In addition, income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities. \n \nInterest Expense.\n  Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt.  See Note 6 for further details.  The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, equity issuances and internally generated cash flow.\n \nAn allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction.\n \nWe stop accruing AFUDC on a project when it is placed into service.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nPinnacle West’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.  Our reportable segment activities are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS.  All other operating segment activities are insignificant to Pinnacle West.  \n \n72\nTable of Contents \nOperating Results – 2024 compared with 2023\nOur consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024, was $609 million, compared with consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $502 million for the prior-year period.  The results reflect an increase of approximately $107 million, primarily as a result of the impacts of new customer rates, increased customer usage and growth, the effects of weather, and higher CRS revenue and LFCR revenue.  These positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense mostly due to increased plant and intangible assets, higher interest charges, net of AFUDC, higher income taxes and lower transmission revenues.\nThe following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders compared with the prior year for Pinnacle West consolidated and for APS consolidated:\n \nPinnacle West Consolidated\nAPS Consolidated\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet \nChange\n2024\n2023\nNet \nChange\n \n(dollars in millions)\nOperating revenues\n$\n5,125 \n$\n4,696 \n$\n429 \n$\n5,125 \n$\n4,696 \n$\n429 \nFuel and purchased power expense\n(1,823)\n(1,793)\n(30)\n(1,823)\n(1,793)\n(30)\nOperating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses\n3,302 \n2,903 \n399 \n3,302 \n2,903 \n399 \nOperations and maintenance\n(1,165)\n(1,059)\n(106)\n(1,159)\n(1,044)\n(115)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(895)\n(794)\n(101)\n(895)\n(794)\n(101)\nTaxes other than income taxes\n(227)\n(224)\n(3)\n(227)\n(224)\n(3)\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\n39 \n53 \n(14)\n39 \n53 \n(14)\nPension and other postretirement non-service credits, net\n49 \n41 \n8 \n49 \n42 \n7 \nOther income and expenses, net\n11 \n7 \n4 \n(11)\n7 \n(18)\nInterest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction\n(377)\n(331)\n(46)\n(312)\n(285)\n(27)\nIncome taxes\n(111)\n(77)\n(34)\n(127)\n(94)\n(33)\nLess income related to noncontrolling interests\n(17)\n(17)\n— \n(17)\n(17)\n— \nNet Income Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n609 \n$\n502 \n$\n107 \n$\n642 \n$\n547 \n$\n95 \n73\nTable of Contents \nOperating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses.  \nOperating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were $399 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period.

See Note 16.  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s other income and expense, net is primarily related to Pinnacle West’s gain on the sale of BCE.\nIncome taxes.\n  Income taxes were $34 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to higher pre-tax income, and lower tax benefits from AFUDC equity, partially offset by higher tax credits.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \nOverview\n \nPinnacle West’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.  The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our Board of Directors and based on a number of factors, including our financial condition, payout ratio, free cash flow and other factors.\n \nOur primary sources of cash are dividends from APS and external debt and equity issuances.  An ACC order does not allow APS to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below 40%.  Per the related ACC order, the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.  At December 31, 2024, APS’s common equity ratio, as defined, was 52%.  Its total shareholder equity was approximately $8.3 billion, and total capitalization was approximately $15.9 billion.  Under this order, APS would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately $6.4 billion, assuming APS’s total capitalization remains the same.  This restriction does not materially affect Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders.\n \nDividends to Pinnacle West from APS are also dependent on a number of factors including, among others, APS’s financial condition and free cash flow, the sources of which vary from quarter-to-quarter due in part to the seasonal nature of electricity demand.  APS’s sources of cash include cash from operations and external sources of liquidity, including long- and short-term external debt financing such as commercial paper, term loan and its revolving credit facility.  Cash from operations is dependent upon, among other things, the rates APS may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates and adjustor recovery mechanisms.  APS’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt.  APS funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, external debt financings and equity infusions from Pinnacle West.  On December 17, 2024, the ACC issued a financing order approving a limit on yearly equity infusions equal to 2.5% of \nAPS’s total ass\nets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis, subject to APS’s equity ratio remaining below the most recently approved rate case capital structure plus 50 basis points.\n75\nTable of Contents \nOn June 12, 2024, Pinnacle West contributed $450 million into APS in the form of an equity infusion.  APS used this contribution to repay short-term indebtedness.  On December 23, 2024, Pinnacle West contributed $345 million into APS in the form of an equity infusion.  APS used this contribution to repay a portion of commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes.\nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities that enhance liquidity and provide credit support for accessing commercial paper markets.  These credit facilities mature in 2029.  See Note 5. \nPinnacle West has an ATM program under which Pinnacle West may offer and sell Pinnacle West common stock and enter into forward sale agreements from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $850 million of common stock is available to be issued under the ATM program, which takes into account the forward sale agreement in effect as of December 31, 2024. \nIn addition to the ATM program, Pinnacle West has forward sale agreements from an equity offering in February 2024 in effect as of December 31, 2024.  In December 2024, Pinnacle West partially settled the February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of 5,377,115 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of $345 million.  The proceeds were recorded in equity.  At December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the remaining February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of 5,863,486 shares of common stock in exchange for cash of $377 million.\n \nFor additional information regarding common stock issuances, the ATM program, and outstanding forward sale agreements, see Note 13.\nSummary of Cash Flows\n \nThe following tables present net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nPinnacle West Consolidated\n \n2024\n2023\nNet Change\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n1,610 \n$\n1,207 \n$\n403 \nNet cash flow used for investing activities\n(1,934)\n(1,694)\n(240)\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities\n323 \n487 \n(164)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(1)\n$\n— \n$\n(1)\n \nArizona Public Service Company\n \n2024\n2023\nNet Change\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n1,610 \n$\n1,275 \n$\n335 \nNet cash flow used for investing activities\n(1,986)\n(1,687)\n(299)\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities\n375 \n412 \n(37)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(1)\n$\n— \n$\n(1)\n76\nTable of Contents \n \nOperating Cash Flows\n \n2024 Compared with 2023.  \nPinnacle West’s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $1,610 million in 2024 compared to $1,207 million in 2023, an increase of $403 million in net cash provided, primarily due to $447 million higher cash receipts from electric revenues, $236 million lower fuel and purchased power costs, $15 million change in net collateral, partially offset by $125 million higher income taxes paid, $104 million higher payments for operations and maintenance costs, $49 million higher interest payments and $17 million of other changes in working capital.\n  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s net cash provided by operating activities primarily relates to APS’s higher income tax cash payments to Pinnacle West and other changes in working capital.\nRetirement plans and other postretirement benefits.  \nPinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries.  Pinnacle West also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  The requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan.  We contribute at least the minimum amount required under ERISA regulations, but no more than the maximum tax-deductible amount.  Under ERISA, the qualified pension plan was estimated to be 100% funded as of January 1, 2025, and was 113% as of January 1, 2024.  Future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions.  We did not make any contributions to our pension plan in 2024 and 2023.  The expected minimum required cash contributions for the pension plan are zero for the next three years and we do not expect to make any voluntary cash contributions in 2025, 2026 or 2027.  Regarding contributions to our other postretirement benefit plan, we did not make any contributions in 2024 or 2023 and do not expect to make any contributions in 2025, 2026 or 2027.  The Company was reimbursed $27 million in 2024, $23 million in 2023, and $26 million in 2022 for prior years retiree medical claims from the other postretirement benefit plan trust assets.  We continually monitor financial market volatility and its impact on our retirement plans and other postretirement benefits, but we believe our liability driven investment strategy helps to minimize the impact of market volatility on our plan’s funded status.  For instance, our pension plan’s funded status, as measured for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) purposes, was 99% funded as of December 31, 2024, and our postretirement benefit plans were 195% funded, as measured for GAAP purposes at December 31, 2024.  See Note 7 for additional details.  \nInvesting Cash Flows\n2024 Compared with 2023.  \nPinnacle West’s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was $1,934 million in 2024 compared to $1,694 million in 2023, an increase of $240 million primarily related to $272 million of increased capital expenditures and $21 million of additional investing activity, partially offset by proceeds of $61 million from the BCE Sale.  See Note 20.  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s net cash used for investing activities primarily relates to the BCE Sale and investments into the Captive Insurance Cell VIE.  See Note 17.\n77\nTable of Contents \nCapital Expenditures.\n  The following table summarizes the estimated capital expenditures for the next three years: \n \nCapital Expenditures\n(dollars in millions)\nEstimated for the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\nAPS\nGeneration:\nClean:\nNuclear Generation\n$\n150 \n$\n165 \n$\n185 \nRenewables and Energy Storage Systems (“ESS”)\n335 \n165 \n430 \nOther Generation (a)\n420 \n540 \n335 \nDistribution\n665 \n670 \n675 \nTransmission\n450 \n675 \n750 \nOther\n380 \n335 \n275 \nTotal APS\n$\n2,400 \n$\n2,550 \n$\n2,650 \n(a)\nIncludes gas generation and environmental projects.\n \nThe table above does not include capital expenditures related to PNW Power projects.\nGeneration capital expenditures are comprised of various additions and improvements to APS’s clean resources, including nuclear plants, renewables and ESS, as well as additions and improvements to existing fossil plants.  We are monitoring the status of environmental matters, which, depending on their final outcome, could require modification to our planned environmental expenditures.\nDistribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades, capital replacements, and new customer construction.  Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines, substations, and line extensions to new residential and commercial developments.\nCapital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.\n \nFinancing Cash Flows and Liquidity\n \n2024 Compared with 2023. \n Pinnacle West’s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was $323 million in 2024 compared to $487 million in 2023, a decrease of $164 million in net cash provided primarily due to $842 million higher long-term debt repayments and a net decrease in short-term debt borrowings of $283 million, partially offset by $624 million in higher issuances of long-term debt and an equity issuance of $345 million.\n APS’s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was $375 million in 2024 compared to $412 million in 2023, a decrease of $37 million in net cash provided primarily due to a net decrease in \n78\nTable of Contents \nshort-term borrowings of $374 million, $250 million higher long-term debt repayments and $50 million in lower issuances of long-term debt, partially offset by $645 million in higher equity infusions.\nSignificant Financing Activities.\n  On December 11, 2024, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.895 per share of common stock, payable on March 3, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 3, 2025.  During 2024, Pinnacle West increased its indicated annual dividend from $3.52 per share to $3.58 per share.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West’s total dividends paid per share of common stock were $3.54 per share, which resulted in dividend payments of $395 million.\nAvailable Credit Facilities\n.  \nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide credit support for their commercial paper.  See Note 5 for more information on available credit facilities.\nEquity Offerings\n.\n  Pinnacle West has an ATM program under which Pinnacle West may offer and sell Pinnacle West common stock and enter into equity forward sale agreements from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors.  \nOn \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Pinnacle West could have settled the outstanding November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement with the physical delivery of \n552,833\n shares of Pinnacle West common stock in exchange for cash of approximately \n$50 million\n.  As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Pinnacle West has not received any proceeds relating to the November 2024 Forward Sale Agreement.  \nIn addition to the ATM program, Pinnacle West entered into certain equity forward sale agreements in February 2024, which were partially settled in December 2024 with the issuance of \n \n5,377,115 shares of common stock.  In connection with the partial settlement, Pinnacle West received net proceeds of $345 million.  At December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the remaining February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of 5,863,486 shares of common stock in exchange for cash of $377 million.  See Note 13.\nOther Financing Matters.\n  See Note 15 for information related to the change in our margin and collateral accounts.\n \nDebt Provisions\n \nPinnacle West’s and APS’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios.  Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants.  For both Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%.  At December 31, 2024, the ratio was approximately 59% for Pinnacle West and 49% for APS.  Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could “cross-default” other debt.  See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.\n \nNeither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade.  However, our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings.\n \nAll of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  All of APS’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank \n79\nTable of Contents \nagreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings.\nOn December 17, 2024, the ACC issued a financing order reaffirming the short-term debt authorization equal to the sum of (i) 7% of APS’s capitalization and (ii) $500 million (which is required to be used for costs relating to purchases of natural gas and power) and approving an increase of the long-term debt limit to $9.5 billion and a limit of permitted annual equity infusions into APS equal to 2.5% of APS’s total assets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis, subject to APS’s equity ratio remaining below the most recently approved rate case capital structure plus 50 basis points.  See Note 6 for additional long-term debt provisions and further discussions of liquidity matters.\nCredit Ratings\nThe ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of February 18, 2025, are shown below.  We are disclosing these credit ratings to enhance understanding of our cost of short-term and long-term capital and our ability to access the markets for liquidity and long-term debt.  The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained.  There is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period.  The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.  Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’s securities and/or result in an increase in the cost of, or limit access to, capital.  Such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments, insurance policies, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and other energy-related contracts.  On March 7, 2024, S&P affirmed the ratings and revised Pinnacle West’s and APS’s outlooks from negative to stable.  On March 20, 2024, Moody’s downgraded both Pinnacle West’s and APS’s credit ratings by a notch and revised their outlooks from negative to stable.  On March 26, 2024, Fitch affirmed APS’s ratings and downgraded Pinnacle West’s ratings by a notch.  Fitch revised the outlook for both Pinnacle West and APS from negative to stable.  At this time, we believe we have sufficient available liquidity resources to respond to a potential downward revision to our credit ratings. \n \nMoody’s\n \nStandard & Poor’s\n \nFitch\nPinnacle West\n \n \n \n \n \nCorporate credit rating\nBaa2\nBBB+\nBBB\nSenior unsecured\nBaa2\nBBB\nBBB\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-2\nF3\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nAPS\n \n \n \n \n \nCorporate credit rating\nBaa1\nBBB+\nBBB+\nSenior unsecured\nBaa1\nBBB+\nA-\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-2\nF2\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\n \n80\nTable of Contents \nContractual Obligations\nPinnacle West has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs.  Material contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows:\n•\nPinnacle West and APS have material long-term debt obligations that mature at various dates through 2050 and bear interest principally at fixed rates.  Interest on variable-rate long-term debt is determined by using average rates at December 31, 2024.  See Note 6.\n•\nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities.  See Note 5 for short-term debt details.\n•\nFuel and purchased power commitments include purchases of coal, electricity, natural gas, renewable energy, nuclear fuel, and natural gas transportation.  See Notes 3 and 10.  Purchase obligations include capital expenditures and other obligations.  See Note 10.  Commitments related to purchased power lease contracts are also considered fuel and purchased power commitments.  See Note 8.\n•\nAPS holds certain contracts to purchase renewable energy credits in compliance with the RES.  See Notes 3 and 10.\n•\nAPS is required to make payments to the noncontrolling interests related to the Palo Verde sale leaseback through 2033.  See Note 17.\n•\nAPS must reimburse certain coal providers for final and contemporaneous coal mine reclamation.  See Note 10.\n•\nPinnacle West’s equity forward sale agreements, which may be settled by Pinnacle West with common stock or cash.  Pinnacle West has classified these agreements as equity transactions in accordance with GAAP.  See Note 13.\n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n \nIn preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period.  Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates.  We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved.\nRegulatory Accounting\nRegulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and FERC, to be reflected in our financial statements.  Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.  \n81\nTable of Contents \nManagement judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction.  This determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in Arizona and is subject to change in the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings, except for pension benefits, which would be charged to OCI and result in lower future earnings.  Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential ACC- or FERC-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities.  We had $1,810 million of regulatory assets and $2,062 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024.  See Notes 1 and 3 for more information.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting\nChanges in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit assets, liabilities and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position.  We review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.  The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (“EROA”), and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates.  Differences between these actuarial assumptions and actual plan results may create volatility in pension and other postretirement benefit expense.  To reduce this volatility, these differences are accumulated and amortized (subject to a corridor of 10% of the greater of plan assets or obligations) as part of the expense over a period of approximately 11 years.  Following are the most relevant actuarial assumptions: \nDiscount Rate.\n  The discount rate is used to measure the plan liability and net periodic cost.  For this assumption, we utilize a yield curve produced by our actuary as of December 31st and employ their projections of the future benefit payments to estimate the projected benefit obligation for each plan.  This process also yields a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same present value for the projection of estimated benefit payments that is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate to that year.  The spot rates are derived from a yield curve composed of domestic AA rated corporate bonds. \nEROA\n.  The EROA is used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term.  For this assumption, we consider historical experience and future expectations of asset classes utilized in the portfolio. \nHealthcare Cost Trend Rates.\n  We consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs, and our actuary provides the Company with a medical trend recommendation based on national medical trend, historical claims performance, benchmarking, and plan design changes.\n82\nTable of Contents \nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2024, reported pension assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2024 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on the Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in millions):\n \nIncrease (Decrease)\nActuarial Assumption (a)\nImpact on\nPension\nPlans\nImpact on\nPension\nExpense\nDiscount rate (b):\n \n \nIncrease 1%\n$\n(231)\n$\n(11)\nDecrease 1%\n271 \n11 \nEROA:\nIncrease 1%\n— \n(24)\nDecrease 1%\n— \n24 \n(a)\nEach fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point.\n(b)\nIn general, changes in the discount rate will not typically have symmetrical effects for increases and decreases of the rate.  Further, a 1% change in a low discount rate environment will have a larger impact than a 1% change in a high discount rate environment.  Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated.  Additionally, the Pension Plan utilizes a liability-driven strategy for its pension asset portfolio, and the obligation and expense sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that a change in interest rates may have on pension asset values. \nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2024, other postretirement benefit obligation on the Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2024 reported other postretirement benefit expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in millions): \n \nIncrease (Decrease)\nActuarial Assumption (a)\nImpact on Other\nPostretirement \nBenefit Plans\nImpact on Other\nPostretirement\nBenefit Expense\nDiscount rate (b):\n \n \nIncrease 1%\n$\n(32)\n$\n(2)\nDecrease 1%\n38 \n3 \nHealthcare cost trend rate (c):\nIncrease 1%\n12 \n5 \nDecrease 1%\n(10)\n(5)\nEROA – pretax:\nIncrease 1%\n— \n(6)\nDecrease 1%\n— \n6 \n83\nTable of Contents \n(a)\nEach fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point.\n(b)\nIn general, changes in the discount rate will not typically have symmetrical effects for increases and decreases of the rate.  Further, a 1% change in a low discount rate environment will have a larger impact than a 1% change in a high discount rate environment.  Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated. \n(c)\nThis assumes a 1% change in the initial and ultimate healthcare cost trend rate.\nSee Note 7 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for derivative instruments, investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts fund, investments held in our other special use funds, certain cash equivalents, and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  We use inputs, or assumptions that market participants would use, to determine fair market value.  We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy.  The determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment.  Our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy.  Actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value.  See Note 1 for a discussion of accounting policies and Note 12 for fair value measurement disclosures.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize an ARO for the future decommissioning or retirement of our tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists.  The ARO liability represents an estimate of the fair value of the current obligation related to decommissioning and the retirement of those assets.  ARO measurements inherently involve uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability.  We use an expected cash flow approach to measure the amount we recognize as an ARO.  This approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes.  The scenarios consider settlement of the ARO at the expiration of the asset’s current license or lease term and expected decommissioning dates.  The fair value of an ARO is recognized in the period in which it is incurred.  The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related assets.  In addition, we accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.  In accordance with GAAP accounting, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets, even if there is no legal obligation for removal. \nAROs as of December 31, 2024 are described further in Note 11.\n84\nTable of Contents \nOTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS\nWe adopted new accounting standard, ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, on December 31, 2024.  We will adopt new accounting standard, ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, on December 31, 2025.  We are currently evaluating the disclosure impacts of the pending adoption of the new accounting standard, ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting: Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, effective for us on   December 31, 2027.  See Note 21 for additional information relating to new accounting standards. \nMARKET AND CREDIT RISKS\n \nMarket Risks\n \nOur operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trusts, other special use funds and benefit plan assets.\n \nInterest Rate and Equity Risk\n \nWe have exposure to changing interest rates.  Changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust, other special use funds (see Notes 12 and 18), and benefit plan assets.  The nuclear decommissioning trust, other special use funds and benefit plan assets also have risks associated with the changing market value of their equity and other non-fixed income investments.  Nuclear decommissioning, coal reclamation, and benefit plan costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices.\nThe tables below present contractual balances of our consolidated long-term and short-term debt at the expected maturity dates, as well as the fair value of those instruments on December 31, 2024, and 2023.  If variable interest rates were to increase by 10% from the December 31, 2024, levels, it would not have a material effect on Pinnacle West Consolidated or APS Consolidated annual interest expense.

fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas.  Our risk management committee, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies.  We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps.  As part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities.\nThe following table shows the net pretax changes in mark-to-market of our energy derivative positions (dollars in millions):\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nMark-to-market of net positions at beginning of year\n$\n(120)\n$\n96 \nDecrease (increase) in regulatory asset\n78 \n(216)\nMark-to-market of net positions at end of year\n$\n(42)\n$\n(120)\nThe table below shows the fair value of maturities of our energy derivative contracts (dollars in millions) at December 31, 2024, by maturities and by the type of valuation that is performed to calculate the fair values, classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  See Note 1, “Derivative Accounting” and “Fair Value Measurements,” for more discussion of our valuation methods.\nSource of Fair Value\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nTotal \nFair \nValue\nObservable prices provided by other external sources\n$\n(32)\n$\n2 \n$\n3 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(27)\nPrices based on

purchases of natural gas and electricity.  The impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures being hedged.  To the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion in the PSA, the amounts are recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability.\n \nCredit Risk\n \nWe are exposed to losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment by counterparties.  See Note 15 for a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy.",
