At a special meeting of shareowners held on November 1, 2024, the Company's shareowners approved the Merger Agreement.  Currently, the Company expects the Merger to close in the first half of 2025; however, the exact timing of the completion of the Merger, if at all, cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror, and (2) each share of public common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to Effective Time (other than shares owned by (i) the Company or its subsidiaries or Mars or its subsidiaries (including Acquiror and its subsidiaries) or (ii) shareowners who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive $83.50 per share in cash, without interest.

Our purpose is creating better days, and a place at the table for everyone, through our trusted food brands. Our vision and purpose are brought to life through our Better Days™ Promise, our promise to advance sustainable and equitable access to food by addressing the intersection of wellbeing, hunger, sustainability, and equity, diversity and inclusion for 4 billion people by the end of 2030 (from a 2015 baseline).\nThis work is not new - we’ve been making progress on these topics for many decades and have been reporting our results annually through our Better Days™ Promise report (formerly Corporate Responsibility Report) and other disclosures since 2009. The information contained in our report is not incorporated by reference herein or otherwise made a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nOur Commitments.\n Kellanova Better Days™ Promise, is our promise to create better days for 4 billion people by the end of 2030 (from a 2015 baseline, unless otherwise indicated), includes the following commitments: \n•\nNourishing 1.5 billion people with our foods and, in doing so, providing clear, science-based, front-of-pack nutrition labeling and by removing industrial trans fats from our recipes by the end of 2030.  \n•\nFeeding 400 million people facing food insecurity through food donations, expanded child feeding programs and disaster relief by the end of 2030. \n•\nAdvancing the wellbeing of 250,000 people in our food value chain, from farming communities to processors, prioritizing support for vulnerable groups by the end of 2030. \n•\nKellanova commits to reach net-zero GHG emissions across the value chain by 2050.

The information on our web site is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nClimate-Related Disclosure.\n Climate change and food security are considerations for Kellanova to ensure the long-term health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products. As a plant-based food company, the success of Kellanova is dependent on having timely access to high-quality, low-cost ingredients, water and energy for manufacturing globally. Risks are identified annually through annual reporting and evaluated in the short (<3 years), medium (3 - 6 years) and long terms (>6 years). These natural capital dependencies are at risk of shortage, price volatility, regulation, and quality impacts due to climate change which is assessed as part of Kellanova’s overall enterprise risk management approach. Specific risks including climate change, deforestation, water, plastics, and social accountability are specifically identified and assessed on a regular basis, especially in emerging market expansion that fuels company growth. \nDue to these risks, Kellanova has implemented short and long-term initiatives to mitigate and adapt to these environmental pressures, as well as the resulting challenge of food security. While these risks are not currently impacting business growth, they must be monitored, evaluated, and mitigated. The Company has incorporated the risks and opportunities of climate change and food security as part of the Differentiate, Drive, & Deliver Strategy and Kellanova Better Days™ Promise by continuing to identify risk, incorporate sustainability indicators into strategic priorities, and report regularly to leadership, the Board, and publicly. \nOversight.\n Kellanova's Board of Directors, including its Social Responsibility and Public Policy Committee, oversees our Better Days™ Promise social and environmental purpose strategy. Our Senior Vice President Chief Global Corporate Affairs Officer, Senior Vice President Global Supply Chain, Senior Vice President Chief Global Human Resources Officer, Senior Vice President, Global Growth Officer and other executives who report to the Chairman and CEO, are responsible for successfully implementing the strategy and regularly updating the CEO and \n4\nBoard Committee. Our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) reports to the Senior Vice President Chief Global Corporate Affairs Officer. Additionally, numerous leaders are accountable for achieving specific social and environmental commitments, based on their roles. \nIn addition, Kellanova has a Global Better Days™ Promise Council and Regional Better Days™ Promise Councils. The Councils ensure execution on priority strategies to maximize environmental and social performance, share best practices to ensure we are progressing against our commitments.\nRaw Materials.\n Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, rice, potato flakes, vegetable oils, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard, corrugate, and flexible packaging are the principal packaging materials used by us. We continually monitor world supplies and prices of such commodities (which include such packaging materials), as well as government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to changes in government policy and regulation (including as a result of new or increased tariffs), changing weather patterns and conditions, climate change, and other supply and/or demand impacting events such as pandemics, geopolitical events, wars or other unforeseen circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term and long-term requirements.\nThe principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the United States include wheat and wheat-based ingredients, potato flakes, oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sugars and sweeteners, vegetable oils, dairy products, eggs, and other ingredients, which are obtained from various sources. While most of these ingredients are purchased from sources in the United States, some materials are imported due to regional availability and specification requirements.\nWe enter into long-term contracts for the materials described in this section and purchase these items on the open market, depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and our relative negotiating power. Although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials and services in the future, and supply pressures have decreased, weather and geopolitical issues could result in other disruptions and logistical delays in 2025. As further discussed herein under Part II, Item 7A, we also use commodity futures and options to hedge some of our costs.\nRaw materials and packaging needed for internationally based operations are available in adequate supply and are sourced both locally and imported from countries other than those where used in manufacturing.\nNatural gas and propane are the primary sources of energy used to power processing equipment at major domestic and international facilities, although certain locations may use electricity, oil, propane or solar cells as needed. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. \nTrademarks.\n \n \nGenerally, our products are marketed under trademarks we own. Our principal trademarks are our housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs related to snacks, frozen breakfast, international cereals and noodles and various other foods manufactured and marketed by us. We also grant licenses to third parties to use these marks on various goods. \nIn connection with the separation of WK Kellogg Co, the Company and WK Kellogg Co entered into agreements providing for intellectual property use and selling rights. Under the Master Ownership and License Agreement Regarding Trademarks and Certain Related Intellectual Property, ownership, use and selling rights of trademarks, domain names and certain copyrights were allocated between Kellanova and WK Kellogg Co.

Certain individual trademarks are also important to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.\nSeasonality.\n Demand for our products is generally level throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays. \nWorking Capital.  \nA description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A within Item 7 of this Report.\nCustomers.\n Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated net sales during 2024, comprised principally of sales within the United States. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2024.  During 2024, our top five customers, collectively, including Wal-Mart, accounted for approxima\ntely 29% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 46% of U.S.\n net sales. There has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry and we believe that this trend is likely to continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service establishments.\nBacklog.\n For the most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was not material to us.\nCompetition.\n We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food products. Principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions, product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price, advertising and promotion.\n6\nResearch and Development.\n Research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other locations around the world. Our expenditures for research and development were approximately (in millions): 2024-$115; 2023-$116; 2022-$111.  Information concerning our research and development expense is located in Note 1 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulation.\n Our activities in the United States are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United States, including those of the European Union and various countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our activities.\nEnvironmental Matters.\n Our facilities are subject to various U.S. and foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations. In 2024, compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position nor do we believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position in 2025.\nHuman Capital Resources.\n On December 28, 2024, we had approximately 24,000 employees. The majority of our employees work on a full-time basis. \n \nWe are also party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. Our human capital objectives include attracting, developing, engaging, rewarding and retaining our employees. \nEquity, Diversity and Inclusion: Our goal is to create a place at the table for everyone. We report to our Board of Directors on a periodic basis about the actions we have taken to make progress on our talent strategy, and we are firmly committed to continuing to advance an inclusive work environment.

Our ten Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs) which include GenK, Gender Equity, Hola (our Latino resource group), Kapable (our resource group for people with disabilities and their supporters), Kellanova African American Resource Group, KVets  and supporters, Multicultural, Origens, Proud (our LBGTQ+ resource group), and Women of Kellanova, also play a critical role in attracting talent, providing mentoring and career development opportunities, delivering commercial business insights and connecting people to the Company and the communities where we do business.\nTraining and Development: We invest in ongoing leadership development through programs for future managers, for experienced managers and our executive leadership training program for developing our future leaders.\nEmployee Engagement: We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of engagement vehicles, from externally managed global opinion surveys to weekly check-ins via our internal global recognition platform.  We also provide a wide array of opportunities for volunteerism through Kellanova’s “Better Days” commitment, and provide matching donations for employees’ service to charities of their choosing in many regions.\nTotal Rewards: We provide a market-based competitive compensation through our salary, annual incentive and long-term incentive programs, and a benefits package that promotes employee well-being across all aspects of their lives, including physical, financial, social and emotional wellbeing. We sponsor a number of benefit plans for eligible employees in the United States and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension plans, defined contributions retirement plans, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other postemployment benefits.  We continually review and implement new programs around the world to meet the evolving needs of our employees, including, but not limited to benefit programs for same sex partners and progressive leave benefits (e.g., paternity/maternity and active Military). We are also offering flexible work arrangements across our global population.\nHealth and Wellness: We aim to create a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued in line with our corporate mission. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our colleagues’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration. Our global employee wellbeing framework, \"My Total Health,\" addresses physical, financial, social and emotional wellbeing to support our employees' personal goals. On an ongoing basis, we focus on each aspect of wellbeing and provide useful information, education, tools and resources. In North America, our “Find your Wings” employee assistance program provides access to valuable Mental Health resources. In addition, our “Lean on Me” program trains employees on how to identify other employees that may be struggling with mental health challenges and pointing them towards our available resources. We also provide company paid access to gyms and mindfulness resources in many parts of the world. Most of our \n7\nlocations now use the My Total Health framework to guide how they communicate and engage with employees in support of their wellbeing.  \nCompany Ethics: The Company has processes in place for compliance with the Code of Conduct for Kellanova Board of Directors and Global Code of Ethics for Kellanova employees, each including a requirement for regular certification that provides employees an opportunity to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest, report actual or potential violations of the law, the Code or policy and acknowledge their obligation to comply with the applicable code.  The Company regularly re-enforces our commitment to ethics and integrity in employee communications, in our everyday actions and through our processes.  In addition, the Company provides targeted training across the globe during the course of the year. The Company also maintains an ethics related hotline, managed by a third party, through which individuals can anonymously raise concerns or ask questions about business behavior.\nFinancial Information About Geographic Areas.\n \nInformation on geographic areas is located in Note 18 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8.\n8\nExecutive Officers.\n The names, ages, and positions of our executive officers (as of February 21, 2025) are listed below, together with their business experience.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nKellanova and Subsidiaries\n \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness overview\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellanova, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Report.\nFor more than 115 years, consumers have counted on Kellanova for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. These foods include snacks, such as crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars and bites; and convenience foods, such as ready-to-eat cereals, frozen waffles, veggie foods and noodles. Kellanova products are manufactured and marketed globally.  Our MD&A references consumption and net sales in discussing our sales trends for certain categories and brands.  We record net sales upon delivery of shipments to our customers. Consumption and share data noted within is based on Nielsen x-AOC or other comparable source, for the applicable period. Consumption refers to consumer purchases of our products from our customers. Unless otherwise noted, consumption and shipment trends are materially consistent.\nProposed merger\nOn August 13, 2024, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which (and subject to the terms and conditions in the Merger Agreement) the Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation. Each share of public common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by (i) the Company or its subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries (including Acquiror and its subsidiaries) or (ii) stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive $83.50 per share in cash, without interest.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.  At a special meeting of shareowners held on November 1, 2024, the Company's shareowners approved the Merger Agreement.  Currently, the Company expects the Merger to close in the first half of 2025; however, the exact timing of the completion of the Merger, if at all, cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nFor further discussion about the Merger, see Note 1 Accounting Policies – Proposed Merger, our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 14, 2024, and our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on September 26, 2024. See the section titled, “Risk Factors” included under Part II, Item 1A of this Report for more information regarding risks associated with the Merger.\nSeparation transaction\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company completed the spin-off of its North American cereal business resulting in two independent public companies, Kellanova and WK Kellogg Co.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the results of WK Kellogg Co are presented as discontinued operations in the Kellanova Consolidated Statement of Income and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The recast operating profit for 2023 and 2022 includes certain costs that are reported in continuing operations but relate to items that will be reimbursed by the transition services agreement (“TSA”) with WK Kellogg Co. We expect that the costs for such services will be fully reimbursed under the TSA for the applicable future periods. Following the end of the TSA period, we expect that such costs will no longer be incurred by Kellanova.\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows for 2023 and 2022 are presented on a consolidated basis for both continuing operations and discontinued operations.\nNigerian Naira\n \nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Nigerian government removed certain currency restrictions over the Nigerian Naira leading to a significant decline in the exchange rate of the Naira to the U.S. dollar on the official market in \n37\nNigeria. Exchange rates have declined further since the second quarter of 2023.  As a result of the decline in the exchange rate, the U.S. dollar value of the assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues of our Nigerian business in our consolidated financial statements has decreased significantly compared to prior periods.\nThe country of Nigeria has continued to experience elevated inflation rates. As of the fourth quarter of 2024 Nigeria is considered a highly inflationary economy for US GAAP purposes.  For financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar has been designated as the functional currency. Highly inflationary accounting requires monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash, receivables and payables, to be remeasured into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate at the end of each period with the impact of any changes in exchange rates being recorded in other income and expense.  Our Nigerian subsidiaries had a net monetary liability balance of approximately $128 million as of December 28, 2024.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventory, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are carried forward at their historical dollar cost, which is calculated using the exchange rate at the date which hyperinflationary accounting is implemented.  The impact of highly inflationary accounting during 2024 was not material but could become material in future periods subject to volatility in exchange rates.   \nThe consolidated assets of our Nigerian business represented approximately 3% of our consolidated assets as of December 28, 2024, compared to 5% as of December 30, 2023.  Net sales of our Nigerian business were 6% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 28, 2024 but could become a smaller percentage of our overall sales if exchange rates as of year-end persist or decline further in 2025.\nIn addition to our consolidated Nigerian business, the Company also has an investment in an unconsolidated entity, Tolaram Africa Foods PTE LTD, that holds an investment in a Nigerian food manufacturer.  This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and is evaluated for indicators of other than temporary impairment. \nSegments \nWe manage our operations through four operating segments that are based on geographic location – North America which includes the U.S. businesses and Canada; Europe which consists principally of European countries; Latin America which consists of Central and South America and includes Mexico; and AMEA (Asia Middle East Africa) which consists of Africa, Middle East, Australia and other Asian and Pacific markets.  These operating segments also represent our reportable segments.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n \nThis filing includes non-GAAP financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. Reported results were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, include all net sales and expenses recognized during the periods. Items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed in the \"Significant items impacting comparability\" section of this filing. Our management team consistently utilizes a combination of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. As a result, we believe the presentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing operating trends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures used for evaluation of performance include currency-neutral and organic net sales, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, adjusted and currency neutral adjusted gross margin, net debt and cash flow. We determine currency-neutral results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.  These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\n•\nCurrency-neutral net sales and organic net sales\n: We adjust the GAAP financial measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral net sales. In addition, we exclude the impact of \n38\nacquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency, resulting in organic net sales. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying net sales performance. By providing these non-GAAP net sales measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of net sales performance for the Company and each of our reportable segments for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives behind net sales growth, pricing realization, and the impact of mix on our business results. These non-GAAP measures are also used to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions.\n•\nAdjusted: gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, operating margin, and diluted EPS\n: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the separation transaction\n, \ncosts of the proposed merger, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, and other costs impacting comparability resulting in adjusted. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. \n•\nCurrency-neutral adjusted: gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, operating margin, and diluted EPS\n: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the separation transaction, costs of the proposed merger, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, other costs impacting comparability, and foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral adjusted. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. \n•\nAdjusted other income (expense):\n We adjust the GAAP financial measure to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded) and certain equity investments, losses resulting from divestitures, and other costs impacting comparability. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing this non-GAAP measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's other income (expense), excluding the impact of the items noted above, for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability.\n•\nAdjusted effective income tax rate:\n We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the separation transaction, costs of the proposed merger, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments, and certain foreign currency contracts, and other costs impacting comparability\n. \nWe excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our pre-tax income and the related tax effect of those items on our adjusted effective income tax rate, and other impacts to tax expense. By providing this non-GAAP measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of the items noted above, for the periods presented.  Management uses this non-GAAP measure to monitor the effectiveness of initiatives in place to optimize our global tax rate.\n39\n•\nNet debt\n: Defined as the sum of long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. With respect to net debt, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities are subtracted from the GAAP measure, total debt liabilities, because they could be used to reduce the Company’s debt obligations. Company management and investors use this non-GAAP measure to evaluate changes to the Company's capital structure and credit quality assessment.\n•\nFree cash flow\n: Defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the Company’s business needs and obligations are met. Additionally, certain performance-based compensation includes a component of this non-GAAP measure.\nThese measures have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.\nSignificant items impacting comparability\n \nMark-to-market\nWe recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension and postretirement benefit plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans were recognized in the year they occur. Mark-to-market gains/losses for certain equity investments are recorded based on observable price changes. Changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that were recognized in the quarter they occur. We recorded a pre-tax mark-to-market gain of $155 million in 2024, a pre-tax mark-to-market loss of $163 million for 2023, and a pre-tax mark-to-market loss of $369 million for 2022. Included within the aforementioned totals was a pre-tax mark-to-market gain for pension plans of $14 million for 2024, a pre-tax mark-to-market loss for pension plans of $146 million for 2023, and a pre-tax mark-to-market loss for pension plans of $229 million for 2022.\nSeparation costs\nThe Company successfully completed the separation of its North America cereal business on October 2, 2023. As a result, we incurred pre-tax charges related to the separation, primarily related to legal and consulting costs, of $36 million for 2024, $60 million for 2023, and $8 million for 2022.\nNetwork optimization\nCosts related to reorganizations to increase the productivity and efficiency of the Company's supply chain. As a result, we incurred pre-tax charges, primarily related to severance and asset impairment, of $143 million for the year ended December 28, 2024. \nProposed merger costs\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement under which Mars has agreed to acquire Kellanova, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. In conjunction with the agreement, we incurred pre-tax charges, primarily related to legal and consulting costs, of $30 million for the year ended December 28, 2024.\nGain on sale of property\nIn December 2024, the Company sold property resulting in a gain of $23 million.\nBusiness and portfolio realignment\nOne-time costs related to reorganizations in support of our Deploy for Growth priorities and a reshaped portfolio; investments in enhancing capabilities prioritized by our Deploy for Growth strategy; and completed and prospective divestitures and acquisitions. As a result, we incurred pre-tax charges, primarily related to reorganizations of $7 million in 2024, $2 million in 2023, and $15 million in 2022.\nDomestic tax benefit\nIn September 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell a foreign subsidiary in Egypt. In conjunction with the agreement, we recognized a tax benefit of $41 million for the year ended December 28, 2024 related to the excess of tax basis over book on our investment in the subsidiary.\n40\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company completed its annual impairment testing and determined the fair value of an intangible asset did not exceed its carrying value. As a result, we incurred pre-tax charges related to the impairment of $34 million for 2023. \nLoss related to divestiture\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company completed the sale of the Russian business. As a result of completing the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on the transaction of approximately $113 million, primarily related to the release of historical currency translation adjustments.\nValuation allowance\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $21 million in conjunction with the separation of our North America cereal business. \nForeign currency translation \nWe evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency-neutral basis. We determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Organic net sales exclude the impact of acquisitions, including the foreign currency impact calculated by applying the prior year foreign currency rates to current period results.\n41\nFinancial results \nFor the full year ended December 28, 2024, our reported net sales decreased 2.8% versus the prior year \ndue to adverse foreign currency translation, the extended impact of elasticity on volume, and the mid-2023 divestiture of its business in Russia, partially offset by positive price/mix. \nOrganic net sales increased 5.6% from the prior year after excluding the impact of foreign currency.\nReported operating profit increased 24.4% versus the prior year \ndue to a favorable swing in mark-to-market impacts, improvement in gross profit margin due to productivity and moderating supply chain cost inflation, and the reimbursement for transition services provided to WK Kellogg Co. \nCurrency-neutral adjusted operating profit increased 21.3%, after excluding the impact of mark-to-market, network optimization, separation costs, proposed merger costs, intangible asset impairment, gain on property sale, and foreign currency.         \nReported diluted EPS of $3.88 for the year increased 72.4% compared to the prior year EPS of $2.25 \ndue to the higher operating profit, a positive swing in mark-to-market impacts, and a positive swing in one-time tax items. \nCurrency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of $3.92 for the year increased 21.4% compared to prior year EPS of $3.23, after excluding the impact of significant items impacting comparability.      \nReconciliation of certain non-GAAP Financial Measures\nConsolidated results (dollars in millions, except per share data)\n2024\n2023\nReported net income attributable to Kellanova\n$\n1,343\n \n$\n951 \nMark-to-market (pre-tax)\n155\n \n(163)\nSeparation costs (pre-tax)\n(36)\n(60)\nNetwork optimization (pre-tax)\n(143)\n— \nProposed merger costs (pre-tax)\n(30)\n— \nBusiness and portfolio realignment (pre-tax)\n(7)\n(2)\nIntangible asset impairment (pre-tax)\n—\n \n(34)\nLoss on divestiture\n—\n \n(113)\nGain on property sale (pre-tax)\n23\n \n— \nIncome tax impact applicable to adjustments, net*\n5\n \n55 \nValuation allowance\n—\n \n(21)\nDomestic tax benefit\n41\n \n— \nAdjusted net income attributable to Kellanova\n$\n1,336\n \n$\n1,289 \nForeign currency impact\n(22)\n— \nCurrency-neutral adjusted net income attributable to Kellanova\n1,358\n \n$\n1,289 \nReported diluted EPS\n$\n3.88\n \n$\n2.25 \nMark-to-market (pre-tax)\n0.45\n \n(0.47)\nSeparation costs (pre-tax)\n(0.10)\n(0.17)\nNetwork optimization (pre-tax)\n(0.41)\n— \nProposed merger costs (pre-tax)\n(0.09)\n— \nBusiness and portfolio realignment (pre-tax)\n(0.03)\n(0.01)\nIntangible asset impairment (pre-tax)\n—\n \n(0.10)\nLoss on divestiture\n—\n \n(0.33)\nGain on property sale (pre-tax)\n0.07\n \n— \nIncome tax impact applicable to adjustments, net*\n0.01\n \n0.17 \nValuation allowance\n—\n \n(0.06)\nDomestic tax benefit\n0.12\n \n— \nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n3.86\n \n$\n3.23 \nForeign currency impact\n(0.06)\n— \nCurrency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS \n3.92\n \n$\n3.23 \nCurrency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth\n21.4\n \n%\nNote: Tables may not foot due to rounding.\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\n* \nRepresents the estimated income tax effect on the reconciling items, using weighted-average statutory tax rates, depending upon the applicable jurisdiction.\n42\nNet sales and operating profit\n2024 compared to 2023\nThe following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2024 versus 2023:\nYear ended December 28, 2024\n(millions)\nNorth America\nEurope\nLatin\nAmerica\nAMEA\nCorporate\nKellanova\nConsolidated\nReported net sales \n$\n6,580\n \n$\n2,499\n \n$\n1,261\n \n$\n2,413\n \n$\n(4)\n$\n12,749\n \nForeign currency\n(5)\n19\n \n(63)\n(1,009)\n—\n \n(1,058)\nOrganic net sales \n$\n6,586\n \n$\n2,479\n \n$\n1,324\n \n$\n3,422\n \n$\n(4)\n$\n13,807\n \nYear ended December 30, 2023\n(millions)\nNorth America\nEurope\nLatin\nAmerica\nAMEA\nCorporate\nKellanova\nConsolidated\nReported net sales \n$\n6,574 \n$\n2,501 \n$\n1,265 \n$\n2,785 \n$\n(4)\n$\n13,122 \nDivestitures\n— \n48 \n— \n— \n— \n48 \nOrganic net sales \n$\n6,574 \n$\n2,453 \n$\n1,265 \n$\n2,785 \n$\n(4)\n$\n13,073 \n% change -

Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Nigerian Naira, Russian ruble, Polish zloty, and Egyptian pound. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial.\n51\nInterest expense and interest income\nInterest expense was $311 million and $303 million for the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.  \nThe increase from the prior year is due primarily to higher average interest rates on long-term debt outstanding after second quarter debt issuances.\nInterest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was $105 million and $101 million for the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The increase from the prior year is due to slightly higher average cash deposits.\nIncome taxes\nOur reported effective tax rate for 2024 and 2023 was 18.4% and 24.8%, respectively.  \nIn September 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell a foreign subsidiary in Egypt. In conjunction with the agreement, the Company recognized a $41 million domestic tax benefit during the third quarter of 2024 for the excess of tax basis over book on the Company's investment in the subsidiary. The lower reported effective tax rate versus the prior year is due primarily to this domestic tax benefit. \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of reported to adjusted income taxes and effective income tax rate for 2024 and 2023.\nConsolidated results (dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nReported income taxes\n$\n304\n \n$\n258\n \nMark-to-market\n39\n \n(28)\nSeparation costs\n(7)\n(22)\nNetwork optimization\n(34)\n—\n \nBusiness and portfolio realignment\n(2)\n4\n \nIntangible asset impairment\n—\n \n(8)\nProposed merger costs\n(7)\n—\n \nGain on property sale\n5\n \n—\n \nForeign valuation allowance\n—\n \n21\n \nDomestic tax benefit\n(41)\n—\n \nAdjusted income taxes\n$\n350\n \n$\n291\n \nReported effective income tax rate\n18.4\n \n%\n24.8\n \n%\nMark-to-market\n0.7\n \n1.1\n \nSeparation costs\n—\n \n(0.6)\nNetwork optimization\n(0.3)\n—\n \nBusiness and portfolio realignment\n—\n \n0.2\n \nProposed merger costs\n—\n \n—\n \nIntangible asset impairment\n—\n \n—\n \nLoss on divestiture\n—\n \n1.8\n \nForeign valuation allowance\n—\n \n1.6\n \nDomestic tax benefit\n(2.8)\n—\n \nAdjusted effective income tax rate\n20.7\n \n%\n20.7\n \n%\nNote: Tables may not foot due to rounding.\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory rates. Additionally, the rate could be impacted by tax legislation and if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.\n52\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt this time we anticipate current cash and marketable security balances, operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other financing sources including commercial paper, credit and bond markets, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. We currently have $2.25 billion of unused revolving credit agreements, including $1.5 billion effective through 2026 and $750 million effective through December 2025, as well as continued access to the commercial paper markets.  We are currently in compliance with all debt covenants and do not have material uncertainty about our ability to maintain compliance in future periods. We continue to utilize available capacity within the Monetization Programs to maintain financial flexibility without negatively impacting working capital. \nOur principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.\nWe have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while establishing competitive market-based terms with suppliers. The impacts of the extended customer terms programs and of the monetization programs are included in our calculation of core working capital and are largely offsetting. These programs are all part of our ongoing working capital management.\nWe periodically monitor our supplier payment terms to assess whether our terms are competitive and in line with local market terms. To the extent that such assessment indicates that our supplier payment terms are not aligned with local market terms, we may seek to adjust our terms, including extending or shortening our payment due dates as appropriate. Supplier payment term modifications did not have a material impact on our cash flows during 2024 and are not expected to have a material impact in 2025.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. \nWe had negative working capital of $0.9 billion and $1.7 billion as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.  \nWe believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, including commercial paper, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n1,760\n \n$\n1,645 \nInvesting activities\n(750)\n(562)\nFinancing activities\n(607)\n(1,110)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n17\n \n2 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n420\n \n$\n(25)\nOperating activities\nThe principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, primarily cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.\nNet cash provided by our operating activities for 2024 totaled $1,760 million compared to $1,645 million in the prior year. The increase is due primarily to the distribution from the Company's postretirement benefit plan of $175 million during the first quarter of 2024, offset by the absence of cash provided by the WK Kellogg Co following the divestiture in the third quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company amended the U.S. retiree health and welfare plan to create a sub-trust to permit the payment of certain benefits for active union employees using a portion of the plan surplus. The one-time transfer of cash from the VEBA trust to the sub-trust was treated as a distribution from the plan in operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n53\nOur total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $55 million and $42 million for the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. \nThe Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we will be subject to minimum PPA funding requirements in 2025. \nWe currently project that we will make total U.S. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2025 of approximately $187 million. Actual 2025 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.\nWe measure free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available over time for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our free cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,760\n \n$\n1,645 \nAdditions to properties\n(628)\n(677)\nFree cash flow\n$\n1,132\n \n$\n968 \nInvesting activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities for 2024 totaled $750 million compared to $562 million in 2023 due primarily to the purchase of marketable securities in conjunction with the distribution from the postretirement healthcare plan partially offset by lower capital expenditures.\nCapital spending in 2024 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, including manufacturing capacity expansions in multiple markets.\nCash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales was 4.9% and 5.1% in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFinancing activities\nOur net cash used in financing activities totaled $607 million compared to $1,110 million during the prior year.  The decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to higher net payoff of notes payable and long-term debt in the prior year, higher repurchases of Company stock during the prior year, and higher proceeds from issuance of stock in the current year.\nTotal debt was $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion at year-end 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table reflects net debt amounts:\n(millions, unaudited)\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\nNotes payable\n$\n113\n \n$\n121 \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n632\n \n663 \nLong-term debt\n4,998\n \n5,089 \nTotal debt liabilities\n$\n5,743\n \n$\n5,873 \nLess:\nCash and cash equivalents\n694\n \n274 \nNet debt\n$\n5,049\n \n$\n5,599 \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, Kellanova issued $300 million of thirty-year 5.75% Notes due 2054, resulting in net proceeds after discount and underwriting commissions of $296 million. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, Kellanova issued €300 million of ten-year 3.75% Notes due 2034, resulting in net proceeds after discount and underwriting commissions of €297 million. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the payment of offering related fees and expenses, repayment of a portion of the €600 million 1.00% Notes when they matured on May 17, 2024. \n54\nIn November 2023, we repaid $550 million, seven-year 2.65% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2023, upon maturity.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company issued $400 million of ten-year 5.25% Notes due 2033, resulting in net proceeds after discount and underwriting commissions of $396 million. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the payment of offering related fees and expenses, repayment of the $210 million 2.75% Notes when they matured on March 1, 2023, and repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings. The Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions, as well as a change of control provision.\nIn November 2022, we repaid €600 million, five-year 0.80% Euro Notes due 2022, upon maturity.\nWe paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $2.26 per share in 2024 versus $2.34 per share in 2023.  On February 21, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $.57 per common share, payable on March 14, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2025. \nWe entered into an unsecured Five-Year Credit Agreement in December 2021, allowing us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $1.5 billion and expiring in December 2026. \nIn December 2024, we entered into an unsecured 364-Day Credit Agreement to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $750 million at any time outstanding, to replace the $1.0 billion 364-day facility that was set to expire in December 2024.\nThe Five-Year and 364 Day Credit Agreements which had no outstanding borrowings as of December 28, 2024, contain customary covenants and warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted, the administrative agents may terminate the commitments under the credit facilities, accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreements, and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lender's letter of credit exposure plus interest. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in these agreements at December 28, 2024.\nOur Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and also contain a change of control provision. There are no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 28, 2024.\nThe Notes do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our 364-Day Credit Facility, which expires in December 2025, as well as our Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in December 2026. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.\nWe monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.\nWe continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of select acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis.  \nMonetization and Accounts Payable Tracking Systems\nWe have a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts (Extended Terms Program). In order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the Extended Terms Program for discrete customers, we entered into agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions (Monetization Programs). Transfers under the Monetization Programs are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Monetization Programs provide for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party; however the maximum funding from receivables \n55\nthat may be sold at any time is currently $975 million, but may be increased or decreased as customers move in or out of the Extended Terms Program and as additional financial institutions move in or out of the Monetization Programs. Accounts receivable sold of $653 million and $697 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Monetization Programs are designed to directly offset the impact the Extended Terms Program would have on the days-sales-outstanding (DSO) metric that is critical to the effective management of the Company's accounts receivable balance and overall working capital. Current DSO levels within North America are consistent with DSO levels prior to the execution of the Extended Term Program and Monetization Programs.\nRefer to Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the sale of accounts receivable.\nWe have agreements with third parties to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers’ ability to monitor and, if elected at their discretion, make offers to sell one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions. We have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers’ receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under the arrangements. However, our right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers.\nRefer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to accounts payable.\nIf financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the Monetization Programs and we are not able to modify related customer payment terms, working capital could be negatively impacted. Additionally, working capital could be negatively impacted if we shorten our supplier payment terms as a result of supplier negotiations. For suppliers participating in the Accounts Payable Tracking Systems, financial institutions may terminate their participation, or we could experience a downgrade in our credit rating that could result in higher costs to suppliers. If working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs, we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for short-term liquidity or increase our long-term borrowings.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and notes payable balances, our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease payments, income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits and unconditional purchase obligations.\nA summary of our operating and finance lease obligations as of December 28, 2024 can be found in Note 9 “Leases and Other Commitments”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\nA summary of principal payments for long-term debt as of December 28, 2024 can be found in Note 10 “Notes Payable and Long-term Debt”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\nInterest payments will be approximately $175 million per year from 2025 through 2029 and approximately $1.1 billion in total from 2030 through the last debt maturity date.  \nA summary of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of December 28, 2024 can be found in Notes 12 “Pension Benefits” and Note 13 “Nonpension Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. See Note 15 “Income Taxes”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for discussion of uncertain tax positions.\nOur unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services.  As of December 28, 2024, \n56\nunconditional purchase obligations totaled approximately $1.2 billion.  Approximately $1.0 billion of these unconditional purchase obligations will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the next 12 months.\nAs of December 28, 2024, we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.\n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nPromotional expenditures\nOur promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally immaterial and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments represent less than 1% of our company’s net sales. However, our company’s total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. \nGoodwill and other intangible assets \nWe review our operating segment and reporting unit structure annually or as significant changes in the organization occur and assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our reporting units with goodwill. Annually during the fourth quarter, in conjunction with our annual budgeting process, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may instead perform a quantitative impairment test. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. The reporting unit’s fair value is estimated using a combination of market multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies. The market multiples approach is based on either sales or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for companies that are comparable to our reporting units. The discounted cash flow approach incorporates assumptions surrounding planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. The assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.  These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we consider the reporting unit impaired and reduce its carrying value of goodwill such that the reporting unit’s new carrying value is the estimated fair value.\nSimilarly, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. Annually during the fourth quarter, in conjunction with our annual budgeting process, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may instead perform a quantitative impairment test. In the quantitative testing, we compare an intangible asset’s estimated fair value with its carrying value with the intangible asset’s fair value being determined using estimates of future cash flows to be generated from that asset based on estimates of future sales, as well as assumptions surrounding earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates consistent with rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.  If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. \nWe also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\n57\nAt December 28, 2024, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $6.8 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands. Within this total, approximately $1.7 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, including $1.6 billion related to trademarks, comprised principally of Pringles and cracker-related trademarks. The majority of all goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded in our North America operating segment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nThe Company's annual reporting unit goodwill impairment testing, performed through the fourth quarter of 2024, consisted of qualitative and quantitative testing. No heightened risk or qualitative indicators of impairment of any reporting units was identified.  \nThe Company's annual intangible asset impairment testing was also performed through the fourth quarter of 2024 consisting of qualitative or quantitative testing for all significant intangible assets\n. \nNo heightened risk or qualitative indicators of impairment for any of the tested intangible assets was identified.\nFair value determinations used in the annual testing require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets requires making assumptions and estimates regarding the Company’s future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of the Company’s control, such as market comparables, rising discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate volatility, or inflation, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, then one or more of our reporting units or indefinite-lived assets might become impaired in the future.\nRetirement benefits\nOur company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities with smaller holdings of other investments. We recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.\nOur expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our results in the year in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.\nAdditionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets.\nTo conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 56% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and a 2024 weighted-average active management premium of 0.84% for the pension plans and 0.95% for the retiree medical plan, (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2024 was 8.00% for the pension and retiree medical plan, which equated to approximately the 58\nth\n and 59\nth\n percentile expectations of our model, respectively. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 44% of our global benefit plan assets.\n58\nBased on consolidated benefit plan assets at December 31, 2024, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly decrease or increase 2025 benefits expense by approximately $21 million. For the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, our actual return on plan assets was less than the recognized assumed return by $108 million and more than the recognized by $52 million, respectively.\nPension assets include a level 3 investment comprising 30% of total plan assets as of December 28, 2024.  The investment, a buy-in annuity contract, is valued based on the estimated cost to enter an equivalent contract at the balance sheet date.\nOur initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. Our initial trend rate for 2025 of 7.00% reflects the recognition of increased short-term inflation and the health care provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. Our initial rate trends downward by 0.25% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. The experience gain arising from recognition of 2024 claims experience was approximately $2 million.\nAssumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. In 2019, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale. In 2021, the SOA released an improvement scale that incorporated an additional year of data. In 2022 through 2024, the SOA did not release an updated improvement scale. In determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of 2024 fiscal year-end, we used the 2019 SOA tables with collar adjustments based on Kellanova’s current population, consistent with the prior year. In addition, our assumption for future mortality improvement continues to be based on mortality information available from the Social Security Administration and other sources, consistent with the prior year and in line with our expectations for future experience. There were no changes to the year-end pension and postretirement benefit obligations due to mortality assumption changes.\nTo conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Willis Towers Watson’s proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe.  The projected benefit obligation for the plan in the United Kingdom is set equal to the fair value of the buy-in annuity contracts. We use a December 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans. Accordingly, we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year.\nBased on consolidated obligations at December 28, 2024, a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2025 benefits expense by approximately $2 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $59 million. All obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.\n \nDespite the previously-described policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material actuarial gains or losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions. During 2024, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $14 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately $142 million in 2023. The total net loss recognized in 2024 was driven by a loss of approximately $108 million from lower than expected asset returns and a loss of approximately $9 million from plan experience, partially offset by a gain of approximately $102 million from assumption changes, including increases in the discount rate.    \nDuring 2024, we made contributions in the amount of $51 million to Kellanova’s global tax-qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly non-discretionary. Additionally, the Company contributes to voluntary employee benefit association (VEBA) trusts to fund certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit obligations. During 2024, we contributed $3 million to our retiree medical programs. During 2024, we transferred assets from our retiree medical program of $175 million to create a sub-trust to permit the payment of certain benefits for active union employees using a surplus from the plan.\n59\nIncome taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. \nWe recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. The tax position will be de-recognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 15 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement monitors the Company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, prior to expiration as well as the reinvestment assertion regarding our undistributed foreign earnings. Changes resulting from management’s assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate. Valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS\nIncome Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures: \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. It will take effect for public entities fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of any incremental disclosures required by this ASU and the planned timing of adoption.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses: \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 to expand the disclosure requirements to include additional disaggregated information about income statement expenses that are commonly presented within existing expense captions. It will take effect for public entities fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of any incremental disclosures required by this ASU and the planned timing of adoption.",
