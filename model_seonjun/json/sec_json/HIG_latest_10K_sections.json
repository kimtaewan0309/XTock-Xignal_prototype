(\"HIG\") (together with its subsidiaries, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we”, or “our”) is a holding company for a group of subsidiaries that provide property and casualty (\"P&C\") insurance, employee group benefits insurance and services, and mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (\"ETF\") to individual and business customers in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom and other international locations. \nPreviously known as The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., the Company changed its name to The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. on February 6, 2025. The Hartford is headquartered in Connecticut and its oldest subsidiary, Hartford Fire Insurance Company, dates back to 1810.

The Company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels to individuals and businesses and is considered a leading property and casualty and employee group benefits insurer. The Hartford Stag logo is one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry.\nAs a holding company, HIG is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and has no significant business operations of its own. The holding company relies on the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal \nsource of cash flow to meet its obligations, pay dividends and repurchase common stock. Information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. may be found in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) — Capital Resources and Liquidity. \nPURPOSE AND STRATEGIC PRIORITIES\nThe Hartford’s mission is to provide people with the support and protection they need to pursue their unique ambitions, seize opportunity, and prevail through unexpected challenges. \nOur strategy to maximize value creation for all stakeholders remains consistent and focuses on the following priorities across our businesses:\n•\nAdvancing leading underwriting capabilities across our portfolio to offer expanded products and services that solve for a broader range of customer needs;\n•\nInvesting in end-to-end transformation, responsibly leveraging data, analytics, digital and artificial intelligence capabilities to drive better, faster decisions and enhance customer experiences; \n•\nEmbracing a culture of growth and innovation and cross-enterprise collaboration;\n•\nAttracting, developing and retaining talent by enhancing our leadership’s capabilities, fostering our differentiating culture and investing in talent pipelines;\n•\nMaximizing distribution channels and product breadth to increase market share;\n•\nOptimizing organizational efficiency with a focus on continuous improvement;  \n•\nBalancing use of excess capital for growth initiatives, investments in the business, and return to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases; and\n•\nContinuing to advance the Company’s sustainability leadership to drive value creation while positively impacting society at large.  \nWe endeavor to maintain and enhance our position as a market leader by leveraging our core strengths of underwriting excellence, risk management, claims, product development and distribution. \nAn ethical, people-oriented, and performance-driven culture drives our values. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our culture and are proud of our reputation for ethics and integrity.\n6\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND CORPORATE\nThe Hartford conducts business principally in five reportable segments, including \nBusiness Insurance (formerly \"Commercial Lines\"), Personal Insurance (formerly \"Personal Lines\"), Property & Casualty Other Operations, Employee Benefits (formerly \"Group Benefits\") and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category. \nThe following discussion describes the principal products and services, marketing and distribution, and competition of The Hartford's reportable segments. For further discussion of the reportable segments, including financial disclosures of revenues by product line, net income (loss), and assets for each reportable segment, see Note 3 - Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2024 Revenues of $26,535 by Segment/Category\n[1]Includes Revenue of $70 for Property & Casualty Other Operations and $147 for Corporate.\n|\nBUSINESS INSURANCE\n2024 Earned Premiums of $12,721 by Line of Business\n \n2024 Earned Premiums of $12,721 by Product \n7\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nPrincipal Products and Services\n \nWorkers' Compensation\nCovers employers for losses incurred due to employees sustaining an injury, illness or disability in connection with their work. Benefits paid under workers’ compensation policies may include reimbursement of medical care costs, replacement income, compensation for permanent injuries and benefits to survivors. Workers’ compensation is provided under both guaranteed cost policies (coverage for a fixed premium) and loss sensitive policies where premiums are adjustable based on the loss experience of the employer.\nGeneral Liability\nCovers a business in the event it is sued for causing harm to a person and/or damage to property. General liability insurance covers third-party claims arising from accidents occurring on the insured’s premises or arising out of their operations. General liability insurance may also cover losses arising from product liability.\nMarine\nEncompasses various ocean and inland marine coverages including cargo, craft, hull, specie, transport and liability, among others.\nPackage Business\nCovers both commercial property and general liability damages.\nCommercial Property\nCovers the building a business owns or leases as well as its personal property, including tools and equipment, inventory, and furniture. A commercial property insurance policy covers losses resulting from fire, wind, hail, earthquake, theft and other covered perils, including coverage for assets such as accounts receivable and valuable papers and records. Commercial property may include specialized equipment insurance, which provides coverage for loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of boilers and machinery. A commercial property insurance policy may also provide replacement of lost income resulting from a covered loss that interrupts business operations.\nProfessional Liability\nCovers liability arising from directors and officers acting in their official capacity and liability for errors and omissions committed by professionals and others. Coverage may also provide employment practices insurance relating to allegations of wrongful termination and discrimination.\nBond\nEncompasses fidelity and surety insurance, including commercial surety, contract surety and fidelity bonds. Commercial surety includes bonds that insure non-performance by contractors, license and permit bonds to help meet government-mandated requirements and probate and judicial bonds for fiduciaries and civil court proceedings. Contract surety bonds may include payment and performance bonds for contractors. Fidelity bonds may include ERISA bonds related to the handling of retirement plan assets and bonds protecting against employee theft or fraud. The Company also provides credit and political risk insurance (\"CPRI\") offered to clients with global operations.\nAssumed Reinsurance\nIncludes assumed reinsurance of property, liability, surety, credit and political, marine and agriculture risks throughout the world but principally in Europe and the Americas. Business principally provides coverage on broad books of business (i.e. treaty), as opposed to individual risks (i.e. facultative).\nCommercial Automobile\nCovers damage to a business's fleet of vehicles due to collision or other perils (automobile physical damage). In addition to first party automobile physical damage, commercial automobile covers liability for bodily injuries and property damage suffered by third parties and losses caused by uninsured or under-insured motorists.\nThrough its three lines of business, \nsmall business (formerly \"small commercial\"), middle & large business (formerly \"middle & large commercial\"), and global specialty, Business Insurance offers its products and services to businesses in the United States (\"U.S.\") and internationally. Business Insurance generally consists of products written for small businesses and middle market companies as well as national and multi-national accounts, largely distributed through retail agents and brokers, wholesale agents and global and specialty insurance and reinsurance brokers. The majority of Business Insurance written premium is generated by small business and middle market lines, which provide coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder’s individual risk characteristics. \nSmall business provides coverages for small businesses, which the Company generally considers to be businesses with an annual payroll under $20, revenues under $50 and property values less than $20 per location. Primary coverages provided include workers' compensation, property, general liability and commercial automobile. Within small business, both property and general liability coverages are offered under a single package policy, marketed under the Spectrum name. Small business also provides excess and surplus lines coverage to small businesses including umbrella, general liability, property and other coverages. \nMiddle & large business provides insurance coverages to medium-sized and national accounts businesses, which are companies whose payroll, revenue and property values exceed \nthe small business definition. In addition to offering standard commercial lines products, including workers' compensation, property, general liability and commercial automobile products, middle & large business includes program business which provides tailored programs, primarily to customers with common risk characteristics. For national accounts, a significant portion of the business is written through large deductible programs. Other programs written within middle & large business are retrospectively-rated where the ultimate premium collected from the insured is adjusted based on how incurred losses for the policy year develop over time, subject to a minimum and maximum premium. Also within middle & large business, the Company writes captive programs business, which provides tailored programs to those seeking a loss sensitive solution where premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. In addition, through business partners, middle & large business offers business insurance coverages to exporters and other U.S. companies with a physical presence overseas. \nLines of business written by small business and middle & large business are subject to rate regulation and written pricing increases or decreases that are partly in response to loss cost trends. Workers’ compensation rates are based on loss experience and are informed by data submitted through the National Council on Compensation Insurance (\"NCCI\"). Workers’ compensation rates have been under downward pressure for the industry due to favorable loss cost trends in recent years.\n8\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nGlobal specialty provides a variety of customized insurance products, including property, general liability, marine, professional liability, and bond. In the U.S., global specialty serves both the admitted and non-admitted markets and produces business through both wholesale and retail brokers. Global specialty also offers various products internationally as a sole corporate member of Lloyd’s Syndicate 1221 (\"Lloyd's Syndicate\"). In addition to offering insurance products, global specialty also offers assumed reinsurance for various risks including property, liability, surety, marine, credit and political, and agricultural primarily in Europe and the America’s.\nMarketing and Distribution\nBusiness Insurance provides insurance products and services through the Company’s regional offices, branches and sales and policyholder service centers throughout the United States and, to a lesser extent, overseas, principally in the United Kingdom. The products are marketed and distributed using independent retail agents and brokers, wholesale agents and global and specialty insurance and reinsurance brokers, with business also sold direct-to-consumer. In addition, the Company offers insurance products to customers of payroll service providers through its relationships with major national payroll companies in the United States and to members of affinity organizations. As the sole corporate member of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221, the Company has the exclusive right to underwrite business up to an approved level of premium in the Lloyd’s of London (\"Lloyd's\") market. \nIn the United States, independent agents, brokers and wholesalers are consolidating. While the acquisition activity has slowed with the rise of rates, we continue to expect large deals by well positioned companies. This will likely result in a larger proportion of written premium being concentrated among fewer agents, brokers and wholesalers. These distribution partners are looking to exercise more control over the insurance value chain and are leveraging data and analytics for bargaining power.\nCompetition\nSmall Business\nIn small business, The Hartford competes against large national carriers, regional carriers and direct writers. Competitors include stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. The small business market remains highly competitive and fragmented as carriers seek to differentiate themselves through product expansion, price, enhanced service and leading technology. Larger carriers such as The Hartford are continually advancing their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business with agents and customers through the use of technology, analytics and other capabilities that improve the process of evaluating a risk, quoting new business and servicing customers. The Company also continuously enhances digital capabilities as customers and distributors demand more access and convenience, and expands product and underwriting capabilities to accommodate both larger accounts and a broader risk appetite.\nExisting competitors and new entrants, including start-up and non-traditional carriers, are actively looking to expand sales of business insurance products to small businesses through increasing their underwriting appetite, deepening their relationships with distribution partners, leveraging emerging \nartificial intelligence capabilities, and through on-line and direct-to-consumer marketing. Carriers that can quote business in an automated way have a competitive advantage by shortening the time from quoting to issuance. Through its ICON quoting tool, The Hartford quotes over 75% of its Spectrum package business and workers’ compensation new business policies without human intervention. \nMiddle & Large Business\nMiddle & large business is considered “higher touch” and involves highly specialized expertise, including individual underwriting and pricing decisions. Competition in this market includes stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. In addition, some larger brokers are now becoming competitors through acquisition of managing general agents or managing general underwriters.  \nThe pricing of middle market and national accounts is prone to significant volatility over time due to changes in individual account characteristics and exposure, as well as legislative and macro-economic forces. National and regional carriers participate in the middle & large business insurance sector, resulting in a competitive environment where pricing and policy terms are critical to securing new business and retaining existing accounts. As a means to mitigate the cost of insurance, middle market and large commercial buyers may opt for loss-sensitive products in-lieu of guaranteed cost policies. \nWithin this competitive environment, The Hartford is continuing to invest in its underwriting systems and capabilities, including investing in speed to market solutions for the lower end of middle market, enhancing its digital experience, leveraging its sales and underwriting talent and expanding its use of data analytics, artificial intelligence capabilities and third party data to make risk selection and pricing decisions as the firm pursues responsible growth strategies to deliver target returns. In product development and related areas such as claims and risk engineering, the Company has expanded its capabilities in industry verticals, such as energy, construction, media arts & entertainment, technology and life sciences.\nGlobal Specialty\nGlobal specialty competes against multi-national insurance and reinsurance companies, in the U.S and London markets. Global specialty writes many surplus lines of business, which are lines of business not written through standard products licensed or admitted in a state (\"nonadmitted\"). In recent years, surplus lines have accounted for a significant portion of the total U.S. property and casualty commercial market, and The Hartford continues to grow its surplus book of business.\nCustomers served by the global specialty marketplace expect tailored policy language for their unique risks and, increasingly, are looking for a single insurance carrier to meet all their coverage needs. The Company has been successful in cross-selling global specialty product lines to customers of small business and of middle & large business and seeks to expand cross-sell opportunities in the future. The Hartford competes on the basis of its underwriting capabilities where it uses data and actuarial insights to enhance risk selection. The Company seeks to drive greater efficiency, shorten the quoting process and improve the customer’s experience through expanded use of digital and artificial intelligence capabilities.\n9\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nGlobal specialty also writes business in the London market via its Lloyd’s syndicate platform. \nThe Lloyd’s platform is comprised of over 50 syndicates and 350 brokers, who benefit from the ability to write risks in over 200 countries using Lloyd’s international licenses. The Lloyd’s platform has shifted from remediation to growth in recent years, as the market emerged from consecutive underwriting losses, returning to more \nprofitable underwriting conditions in recent years. \nLloyd’s is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") and Prudential Regulatory Authority (\"PRA\") in the U.K. For further discussion, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Capital Resources and Liquidity.\n|\nPERSONAL INSURANCE\n2024 Earned Premiums of $3,453 by Line of Business\n2024 Earned Premiums of $3,453 by Product\nPrincipal Products and Services\nPersonal Automobile\nCovers damage to an individual insured’s own vehicle due to collision or other perils and is referred to as automobile physical damage. In addition to first party automobile physical damage, automobile insurance covers liability for bodily injuries and property damage suffered by third parties and losses caused by uninsured or under-insured motorists. Also, under no-fault laws, policies written in some states provide first party personal injury protection. Some of the Company’s personal automobile insurance policies also offer personal umbrella liability coverage for an additional premium.\nHomeowners\nInsures against losses to residences and contents from fire, wind and other perils. Homeowners insurance includes owned dwellings, rental properties and coverage for tenants. The policies may provide other coverages, including loss related to recreational vehicles or watercraft, identity theft and personal items such as jewelry.\nPersonal Insurance provides automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to individuals across the United States, mostly through a program designed exclusively for members of AARP (“AARP Program”). The Hartford's automobile and homeowners products provide coverage options and pricing tailored to a customer's individual risk. The Hartford has individual customer relationships with AARP Program policyholders and, as a group, they represent a significant portion of the total Personal Insurance's business. Business sold to AARP members, either direct or through independent agents, amounted to earned premiums of $3.2 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The AARP relationship provides The Company with a competitive advantage to capitalize on the continued growth of the over age 50 population.\nThe Company has rolled out its new cloud-based product and platform, Prevail, which is now in market in nearly all states. Prevail is tailored to the mature market and includes digital service capabilities that provide real time transaction support. Among other things, overall rate levels, price segmentation, rating factors and underwriting procedures are being updated through the introduction of Prevail. Personal Insurance works with carrier partners to provide risk protection options for AARP members with needs beyond the company’s current product offering.\n10\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nMarketing and Distribution\nPersonal Insurance reaches diverse customers through multiple distribution channels, including direct-to-consumer and independent agents. In the direct-to-consumer channel, Personal Insurance markets its products through a mix of media, including digital marketing, direct mail, print advertising, and television. In the agency channel, Personal Insurance provides products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market, primarily serving mature, preferred consumers. These independent agents are not employees of the Company.\nPersonal Insurance has made significant investments in offering direct and agency-based customers the opportunity to interact with the company on-line, including via mobile devices. In addition, its technology platform for telephone sales centers enables sales representatives to provide an enhanced experience for direct-to-consumer customers, positioning the Company to offer unique capabilities to AARP’s member base.\nMost of Personal Insurance's sales are associated with its exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP, with the current agreement in place through December 31, 2032, to market automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to AARP's approximately 38 million members. This relationship with AARP, which has been in place since 1984, provides Personal Insurance with an important competitive advantage given the increase in the population of those over age 50 and the strength of the AARP brand.\nPrior to May 2021, in most states, new business automobile and home policies were issued to AARP members with a lifetime continuation agreement endorsement, providing that the policies will be renewed as long as certain terms are met, such as timely payment of premium and maintaining a driver’s license in good standing. However, beginning in May 2021, Personal Insurance no longer offers the lifetime continuation agreement to new home and automobile policies. The endorsement will remain on renewal policies with original effective dates prior to May 2021.\nIn addition to selling to AARP members, Personal Insurance offers its automobile and homeowners products to non-AARP customers, primarily through the independent agent channel. Personal Insurance leverages its agency channel to primarily target the over age 50 preferred mature market, which values the advice of an independent agent and recognizes the differentiated experience the Company provides. In particular, the Company has taken action to distinguish its brand within the over age 50 preferred mature market and improve profitability in the independent agent channel, placing more emphasis on our highly partnered agents.\nCompetition\nThe personal automobile and homeowners insurance markets are highly competitive. In 2024, many personal lines insurance companies, including The Hartford, increased marketing spend in order to increase new business production after returning to new business rate adequacy. Personal Insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that compete principally on the basis of price, product, service, including claims handling, the insurer's ratings and brand recognition. Companies with strong ratings, recognized brands, direct sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage.\nInsurers that distribute products principally through agency channels compete by offering commissions and additional incentives to attract new business. To distinguish themselves in the marketplace, top tier insurers are offering digital and self-service capabilities that make it easier for agents and consumers to do business with the insurer. A large majority of agents have been using “comparative rater” tools that allow the agent to compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. The use of comparative rater tools increases price competition. Insurers that are able to capitalize on their brand and reputation, differentiate their products and deliver strong customer service are more likely to be successful in this market.\nThe use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to target the most profitable business, and carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments. The Company continues to invest in capabilities to better utilize data and analytics, and thereby, refine and manage underwriting and pricing. Many carriers, including The Hartford, continue to invest in telematics capabilities to enable better risk selection and pricing segmentation in response to changes in driving patterns. Currently in the states where the Prevail product has rolled out, The Hartford offers its telematics program, TrueLane, which uses a mobile app solution to offer discounts for good driving behavior based on such attributes as braking, speed, distracted driving, and acceleration.\nAlso, automobile technology advancements, including lane departure warnings, backup cameras, automatic braking and active collision alerts, continue to be deployed  and are expected to improve driver safety and reduce the likelihood of vehicle collisions. However, these features include expensive parts, contributing to increasing average claim severity. \nIn 2024, inflation continued to impact the industry. Supply chain pressures, advanced vehicle technology, body shop capacity, and a tight labor market have increased the cost of automobile repairs, although there were some areas of moderation such as used car prices. In addition, a tight labor market and inflation on material prices increased the cost to repair homes.\n|\nP&C OTHER OPERATIONS\nProperty & Casualty Other Operations includes certain property and casualty operations managed by the Company that have discontinued writing new business and includes substantially all of the Company's pre-1986 asbestos and environmental (\"A&E\") exposures. For a discussion of coverages provided under policies written with exposure to A&E prior to 1986 reported \nwithin the P&C Other Operations segment (“Run-off A&E”), run-off assumed reinsurance and all other non-A&E exposures, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property & Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.\n11\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\n|\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n2024 Premiums and Other Considerations of $6,615\n \nPrincipal Products and Services\nGroup Life\nTypically is term life insurance provided in the form of a yearly renewable policy. Other life coverages in this category include accidental loss of life and severe injury benefits and business travel accident insurance.\nGroup Disability\nTypically comprised of short-term disability, long-term disability, and paid family leave plans that pay a percentage of an employee’s salary for a period of time if they are ill or injured and cannot perform the duties of their job. Short-term and long-term disability policies have elimination periods that must be satisfied prior to benefit payments. The Company also earns fee income from leave management services for federal, state and employer family and medical leave and workplace accommodation programs, as well as the administration of employer self-funded disability plans.\nOther Products\nIncludes other group coverages such as retiree health insurance, critical illness, accident and hospital indemnity coverages.\nEmployee Benefits provides group life, disability and other group coverages to members of employer groups, associations and affinity groups through direct insurance policies and provides reinsurance to other insurance companies. Group insurance typically covers an entire group of people under a single contract, most typically the employees of a single employer or members of an association. In addition to employer paid coverages, the segment offers voluntary product coverages which are offered through employee payroll deductions. Employee Benefits also offers disability underwriting, administration, and claims processing to self-funded employer plans. In addition, the segment offers a single-company leave management solution, which integrates work absence data from the insurer’s short-term and long-term group disability and workers’ compensation insurance business with its leave management administration services.\nStatutory paid family leave (\"PFL\") and paid family and medical leave (\"PFML\") programs are a source of growth as the Company offers fully insured coverage or administers self-insured coverage for some of these programs. As of year-end 2024, thirteen states and the District of Columbia have enacted mandated PFL or PFML programs. Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,  Kentucky, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, \nVermont, and Virginia have also created opt-in paid family leave programs, and additional states are considering adopting PFL or PFML programs. \nEmployee Benefits generally offers term insurance policies, allowing for the adjustment of rates or policy terms at renewal in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, loss costs, changes in interest rates and other factors. Policies are typically sold with one, two or three-year rate guarantees depending upon the product and market segment.\nMarketing and Distribution\nThe Employee Benefits distribution network is managed through a regional sales office system to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution outlets including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. Additionally, the segment has relationships with several private exchanges which offer its products to employer groups. Technology providers, including human resources platform vendors, are taking an increasingly prominent role in influencing customer decisions that also influence selection of the employee benefits insurance provider.\n12\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nCompetition\nEmployee Benefits competes with numerous insurance companies and financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. The market for employee benefits continues to grow as employees and employers continue to demand employee benefits for addressing mental health, wellness, and caregiving costs.\nIn order to differentiate itself, Employee Benefits uses its risk management expertise and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. Competitive factors include the extent of products offered, price, the quality of customer and claims handling services, digital capabilities, and the Company's relationship with third-party distributors and private exchanges. Active price competition continues in the marketplace, resulting in multi-year rate guarantees being offered to customers. Top tier insurers in the marketplace also offer digital and self-service capabilities to third party distributors and consumers. The relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the Employee Benefits business provides a competitive advantage over smaller competitors. \nThe Company's market presence has increased in recent years, benefiting from our industry leading digital technology and integrated absence management and claims platform.\nAdditionally, as employers continue to focus on reducing the cost of employee benefits, we expect more companies to offer voluntary products paid for by employees. Across the industry, the sale of voluntary product offerings, including supplemental health coverage, is growing at a faster rate than employer-provided benefits. Competitive factors affecting the sale of voluntary products include the breadth of products, product education, enrollment capabilities and overall customer service. The Company, as well its competitors, are investing in technology to offer digital capabilities, and to improve product offerings and service levels, particularly with voluntary products. \nWe offer our voluntary products including critical illness, accident and hospital indemnity coverage to employees through our Employee Choice Benefits programs. The Company's enhanced enrollment and marketing tools, such as My Tomorrow©, are providing additional opportunities to educate individual participants about supplementary benefits and deepen their knowledge about product selection.\nIn addition to providing group disability, leave management and life insurance, we offer integrated claim, leave and benefits administration with The Hartford's Ability Advantage platform. \n|\nHARTFORD FUNDS\nHartford Funds Segment Assets Under Management (\"AUM\") of $139,598 as of December 31, 2024\nMutual Fund AUM of $123,571 as of December 31, 2024\n13\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nPrincipal Products and Services\nMutual Funds\nIncludes approximately 60 actively managed mutual funds across a variety of asset classes including domestic and international equity, fixed income, and multi-strategy investments, principally sub-advised by two unaffiliated institutional asset management firms. \nExchange-traded funds\nExchange-traded funds (\"ETF\") include actively managed ETFs and multifactor ETFs. Actively-managed ETFs include fixed income, domestic equity and commodity products utilizing the same investment platform as our mutual funds. Multifactor ETFs are designed to track indices using passive investment techniques that strive to improve performance relative to traditional capitalization-weighted indices.\nThird-party life and annuity separate accounts under management\nRelates to assets of the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 that are still managed by the Company's Hartford Funds segment.\nThe Hartford Funds segment provides investment management, administration, product distribution and related services to investors through a diverse set of investment products in domestic markets. Hartford Funds' comprehensive range of products and services assist clients in achieving their desired investment objectives. AUM are separated into three distinct categories referred to as mutual funds, ETFs and third-party life and annuity separate accounts under management.\nMarketing and Distribution\nOur funds and ETFs are sold through national and regional broker-dealer organizations, independent financial advisers, defined contribution plans, financial consultants, bank trust groups and registered investment advisers. Our distribution team is organized to sell primarily in the United States.\nCompetition\nThe investment management industry is mature and highly competitive. Firms are differentiated by investment performance, range of products offered, brand recognition, financial strength, proprietary distribution channels, quality of service and level of fees charged relative to quality of investment products. The Hartford Funds segment competes with a large number of asset management firms and other financial institutions and differentiates itself through its global sub-advisors, product breadth, competitive fees and strong distribution. The segment also competes directly with lower cost passive investment strategies, which continue taking share from active managers.\n|\nCORPORATE\nThe Company includes in the Corporate category capital raising activities (including equity financing, debt financing and related interest expense), purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill, reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, restructuring costs, transaction expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition, certain M&A costs, and other expenses not allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate also includes investment management fees and expenses related to managing third-party assets. \n14\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1.

Business\nUNDERWRITING FOR P&C AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nThe Company underwrites the risks it insures in order to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification. Risk modeling is used to manage, within specified limits, the aggregate exposure taken in each line of business and across the Company. For property and casualty business, aggregate exposure limits are set by geographic zone and peril. Products are priced according to the risk characteristics of the insured’s exposures. Rates charged for Personal Insurance products are filed with the states in which we write business. Rates for most Business Insurance products are also filed with the states but the premium charged may be modified based on the insured’s relative risk profile and workers’ compensation policies may be subject to modification based on prior loss experience. The Company also writes coverage in the excess and surplus lines market, primarily within global specialty, which is characterized by the absence of regulation related to rate and form and allows for more pricing and coverage flexibility to write certain classes of business. Pricing for Employee Benefits products, including long-term disability and life insurance, is also based on an underwriting of the risks and a projection of estimated losses, including consideration of investment income.\nPricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company’s response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments and the Lloyd's Syndicate's ability to write business is subject to Lloyd's approval for its premium capacity each year. \nGeographic Distribution of Earned Premium \n(% of total)\nLocation\nBusiness Insurance\nPersonal Insurance\nEmployee Benefits\nTotal\nCalifornia\n8 \n%\n2 \n%\n2 \n%\n12 \n%\nNew York\n6 \n%\n1 \n%\n3 \n%\n10 \n%\nTexas\n5 \n%\n2 \n%\n2 \n%\n9 \n%\nFlorida\n3 \n%\n1 \n%\n2 \n%\n6 \n%\nAll other [1]\n35 \n%\n9 \n%\n19 \n%\n63 \n%\nTotal\n57\n \n%\n15\n \n%\n28\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n[1]\nNo other single state or country accounted for 5% or more of the Company's consolidated earned premium in 2024.\nCLAIMS ADMINISTRATION FOR P&C AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nClaims administration includes functions associated with the receipt of initial loss notices, claims adjudication and estimates, legal representation for insureds where appropriate, establishment of case reserves, payment of losses and notification to reinsurers. These activities are performed by approximately 6,900 claim employees including, among others, claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys, doctors, nurses, behavioral health specialists, investigators and data analytics professionals as well as training staff, management, and support staff. The Company contracts with a select number of approved regional, national and international suppliers to enhance claim capabilities and business resiliency.\nThe Company's claims teams manage losses across the U.S. and internationally, working from locations across the U.S. and in two of our international offices. The teams are organized to meet the specific claim service needs for our various product offerings. The claims organization is supported by data and analytics, technology, and strategy located across the U.S. and in two of our international offices.\nAs a leading provider of workers’ compensation and employee benefits coverages, the Company leverages data analytics to return employees to active, productive lives as soon and safely as possible. Clinical experts focus on opioid usage, vocational rehabilitation, behavioral health and medical case management which we believe provides the Company with a competitive advantage for managing medical costs. \nThe Company maintains a dedicated catastrophe claims organization that is positioned to respond to large-scale catastrophic events across the country. For the most severe events, the team is supplemented with additional Company staff to respond to claimants promptly after an event.\nThe Company's claims organization has a nationwide staff of attorneys who represent insureds in key jurisdictions, including dedicated lawyers specializing in complex litigation.\nClaim payments for benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses are the largest expenditure for the Company.\nREINSURANCE\nFor discussion of reinsurance, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management and Note 8 - Reinsurance of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n16\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nINVESTMENT OPERATIONS\nHartford Investment Management Company (“HIMCO”) is an SEC registered investment advisor and manages the Company's investment operations. HIMCO provides customized investment strategies for The Hartford's investment portfolio, as well as for The Hartford's pension plan and institutional clients.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of HIMCO’s total assets under management was approximately $112.0 billion and $108.5 billion, respectively, including $50.9 billion and $50.3 billion, respectively, that were held in HIMCO managed third party accounts and $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, that support the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nThe Hartford's Investment Portfolio of $59.2 billion as of December 31, 2024\nManagement of The Hartford's Investment Portfolio \nHIMCO manages the Company's investment portfolios to maximize economic value, ensure sufficient funding of the Company's liabilities, and achieve enterprise financial objectives while remaining within acceptable risk tolerances. Portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including timing and amount of claim payment obligations, investment return opportunity, and risk characteristics. The Company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the Company’s results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset diversification, asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching, and active portfolio management, which may include the use of derivatives. Risk tolerances considered include, but are not limited to, asset sector exposure limits, credit issuer allocation limits, portfolio quality constraints including maximum exposure to below investment grade holdings, and interest rate duration limits. For further discussion of HIMCO’s portfolio management approach, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management.\nENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company has insurance, operational and financial risks. For discussion on how The Hartford manages these risks, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management.\nREGULATION\nState and Foreign Insurance Laws\nState insurance laws are intended to supervise and regulate insurers with the goal of protecting policyholders and ensuring the solvency of the insurers. As such, the insurance laws and regulations grant broad authority to state insurance departments (“Departments”) to oversee and regulate the business of insurance. The Departments monitor the financial stability of an insurer by requiring insurers to maintain certain solvency standards and minimum capital and surplus requirements; invested asset requirements; state deposits of securities; guaranty fund premiums; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; and adequate reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. In addition, the Departments perform periodic market and financial examinations of insurers and require insurers to file annual and other reports on the financial condition of the companies. Policyholder protection is also regulated by the Departments through licensing of insurers, sales employees, agents and brokers and others; approval of premium rates and policy forms; and claims administration requirements.\nMany states also have laws regulating insurance holding company systems. These laws require insurance companies, which are formed and chartered in the state (“Domestic Insurers”), to register with the state department of insurance (referred to as their “domestic state or regulator”) and file information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. Insurance holding company regulations principally relate to (i) state insurance approval of the acquisition of Domestic Insurers, (ii) prior review or approval of certain transactions between the Domestic Insurer and its affiliates, and (iii) regulation of dividends made by the Domestic Insurer. All transactions within a holding company system affecting Domestic Insurers must be determined to be fair and equitable.\nThe extent of financial services regulation on business outside the United States varies significantly among the countries in which The Hartford operates. Foreign financial services providers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. Our International operations include a Lloyd’s Syndicate which is required to meet the minimum market standards set by Lloyd’s, as well as UK PRA and UK FCA regulatory requirements. Consistent with the U.K.'s current interpretation of Solvency II, both Lloyd’s and the PRA focus on the adequacy of capital held and solvency of an insurer against the risk profile and management of the authorized insurer in setting capital requirements.\n17\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nFederal and State Securities and Financial Regulation Laws\nThe Company sells and distributes its mutual funds and ETFs through a broker dealer subsidiary, and is subject to regulation promulgated and enforced by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the SEC and/or, in some instances, state securities administrators. Other subsidiaries operate as investment advisers registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers’ Act of 1940, as amended, and are registered as investment advisers under certain state laws, as applicable. Because federal and state laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in securities markets, they generally grant regulators broad rulemaking and enforcement authority. Some of these regulations include, among other things, regulations impacting sales methods, trading practices, suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds, corporate governance, capital, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.\nFailure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property.\nWe have a trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of The Hartford name, the Stag Logo and the combination of these two trademarks. The duration of trademark registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. We regard our trademarks as highly valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to on-line quoting, insurance related processing, insurance telematics, proprietary interface platforms, and other matters. Patents are of varying duration depending on filing date, and will typically expire at the end of their natural term.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Hartford has approximately 19,100 employees as of December 31, 2024.\nManagement, including the CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer (\"CHRO\"), establishes the hiring and compensation practices for our Company. The Board is periodically updated on key employee engagement measures (including employee survey results). The Board's Audit Committee receives an annual review of the Company's key employee relations measures. In addition, the Board’s Compensation and Management Development Committee (“Compensation Committee”) is responsible for reviewing performance and \napproving compensation paid to senior executives, and, among other things, the oversight of succession and continuity planning for senior executive roles, setting the Company's executive compensation policy and administering the Company's Clawback Policy for senior executives. Our Human Resources team, led by our CHRO, supports the Compensation Committee in the execution of its responsibilities. In addition to the day-to-day support and counseling they provide to our leaders, managers and employees, the Human Resources team also monitors key indicators to keep a pulse on trends across our employee population including strategic workforce planning, employee engagement, employee relations matters, career mobility, talent attraction, retention, and development.\nTalent Attraction, Retention and Development\nOur commitment to a robust talent pipeline starts at the top. The Board of Directors engages with the Compensation Committee annually to review senior executive level talent, consider key emerging executive talent and conduct succession planning. In addition, our leadership team conducts a comprehensive annual talent review process across our organization each year.\nTo keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and the expectations of employees and external candidates, we focus on a broad array of actions, including:\n•\nProviding career growth and development opportunities aligned to our strategies through our strategic workforce plans, executive, professional and front-line recruitment, internal mobility and job progression, and retention strategies; \n•\nOffering extensive learning and development opportunities to sustain the skills needed for the roles we have today and those we anticipate in the future; and\n•\nHolding leaders accountable for their progress against human capital goals that include development, engagement, mobility, succession, and retention. \nFor entry-level roles in the organization, we recruit at colleges and universities, and offer a range of training and development programs, including:\n•\nThe Hartford’s Leadership Development Program, which provides curriculum to enhance leadership skill sets for all participants – from first-time leaders through our executive ranks;\n•\nThe Hartford Early Career Leadership Program, which offers programs in Actuarial, Finance, Underwriting, Claims & Operations and Technology through rotational development to gain a breadth of experiences;\n•\nThe Hartford’s Apprenticeship Program, which prepares students for careers in insurance; and\n•\nOur Hart-Academy Tech training program for employees introduced HartCloud Academy in 2024 offering an immersive training program for our mid-career engineers to advance their proficiency in cloud technologies.\nThe Hartford prioritizes sustaining a workforce that upholds the highest standards of ethics and trust. We are committed to creating a work environment where employees are respected, \n18\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1. Business\ninspired to perform at their best, and are recognized for their contributions. The Hartford believes that fostering a culture of integrity and ethical behavior leads to better decisions, outcomes and experiences for both our customers and employees. We believe that creating a work environment centered on trust enables us to attract, retain and leverage top talent to meet our business goals. We are committed to ethical conduct and a bias-free workplace for all employees as we build, enhance and sustain a welcoming and supportive \nculture.\nIn 2024, we achieved top quartile employee engagement and performance enablement scores, as measured by independent third party surveys, through continued focus on supporting our customers’ needs, leader effectiveness, collaboration, innovation and risk-taking, career growth, belonging and well-being.\nWe have nine Employee Resource Groups (“ERG’s”) that are voluntary participation groups led by employees, open to all and dedicated to enabling people to share their unique perspectives and experience. These groups focus on the development and success of our employees and our business results through education, networking, mentorship and volunteer opportunities. As of December 31, 2024, over 60% of employees were members of at least one ERG. In 2024, employee-led Courageous Conversations, also allowed participants to engage in meaningful dialogue, which can help fuel innovation and position us for success.\nWe persistently work to improve the employee experience in support of our continuing strategic objective to attract, retain and develop the best talent in the industry.\nPay and Benefits\nCompensation and Pay Equity\nWe offer competitive pay and benefits to our employees, with performance-based variable compensation making up a large share of the total compensation paid to executives in the organization. Variable compensation for the majority of employees includes an annual bonus plan. Our executives also receive long-term incentive awards. Annual bonus payouts are informed by whether the Company achieves core earnings (as adjusted for compensation purposes) above or below a target level that is determined from the annual operating plan set at the beginning of each year and reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. Long-term incentive awards include restricted stock units, performance shares and, for the most senior executives, stock options. Additional information about The Hartford’s variable compensation programs is provided in the Company’s Proxy Statement.\nWe use an independent third party to conduct statistical pay equity analyses for the vast majority of our U.S. employees each year – a three-step process that includes analysis before, during and after the annual compensation planning cycle. This enables us to identify unexplained pay disparities, conduct additional research to determine reasons for these differences and take appropriate actions to address the disparities if necessary. \nThe Compensation Committee is updated annually on our pay equity processes and results. \nThe Hartford also engages in a number of additional practices to ensure pay fairness, including:\n•\nCentralized compensation function that helps maintain consistent programs and practices across the enterprise;\n•\nEnterprise-wide framework for evaluating and aligning roles and compensation levels based on job responsibilities, market competitiveness, strategic importance of the role, and other relevant factors;\n•\nProhibition against asking external job applicants for current or historical compensation information;\n•\nA practice to disclose to applicants and employees the salary ranges for most posted positions;\n•\nIndividual compensation decisions that consider each employee’s experience, proficiency, and performance;\n•\nTraining available for managers and Human Resources business partners on performance assessment and compensation planning; and\n•\nMultiple levels of review and approval required for all compensation decisions.\nWe are committed to our extensive, long-standing policies and practices to help ensure fair pay across the organization, while also staying attuned to external best practices and insights, and leveraging input from subject matter experts. We evaluate our performance every year, and as markets and talent pools shift over time we work to evolve our practices accordingly.\nEmployee Benefits and Well-Being\nThe Hartford offers a comprehensive benefits and well-being package that supports our employees’ physical, emotional, social and financial well-being and helps them achieve their full potential. Our extensive benefits include: \n•\nMedical plan options;\n•\nDental and vision coverage options;\n•\n401(k) plan with company non-elective and matching contributions;\n•\nPaid time off (\"PTO\") with at least 25 days of annual eligibility to start;\n•\nPaid holidays;\n•\nFlexible work schedules, including hybrid or remote work arrangements;\n•\nTuition reimbursement;\n•\nStudent loan repayment assistance;\n•\nFamily medical leave;\n•\nPaid parental leave;\n•\nTravel reimbursement to access medical services in other locations as needed;\n•\nFamily building support, including adoption support program;\n•\nOrgan and bone marrow donation leave policy; and\n•\nEmployee assistance program.\nThe Company also offers a medical advocacy program and well-being programs, weight management, fitness reimbursement and more.\n19\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Business\nPart I - Item 1.

Management believes that these ratios and measures are useful in understanding the underlying trends in The Hartford’s businesses. However, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the results presented in the segment discussions that follow in this MD&A. These ratios and measures may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company’s competitors.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP and Other Measures and Ratios\nAssets Under Management (“AUM”)-\n Include mutual fund and ETF assets. AUM is a measure used by the Company's Hartford Funds segment because a significant portion of the segment’s revenues and expenses are based upon asset values. These revenues and expenses increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.\n38\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBook Value per Diluted Share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\")- \nThis is a non-GAAP per share measure that i\ns calculated by dividing (a) common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. The Company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes that excluding AOCI from the numerator is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per diluted share is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\n \nCombined Ratio-\n The sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting losses.\nCore Earnings- \nThe Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings as an important measure of the Company’s operating performance. The Hartford believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Company’s ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain items. Therefore, the following items are excluded from core earnings:\n•\nCertain realized gains and losses - Generally realized gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income.\n•\nRestructuring and other costs - Costs incurred as part of a restructuring plan are not a recurring operating expense of the business.\n•\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - Largely consisting of make-whole payments or tender premiums upon paying debt off before maturity, these losses are not a recurring operating expense of the business.\n•\nGains and losses on reinsurance transactions - Gains or losses on reinsurance, such as those entered into upon sale of a business or to reinsure loss reserves, are not a recurring operating expense of the business.\n•\nIntegration and other non-recurring M&A costs - These costs, including transaction costs incurred in connection with an acquired business, are incurred over a short period of time and do not represent an ongoing operating expense of the business. \n•\nChange in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business - These changes in loss reserves are excluded from core earnings because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition. \n•\nDeferred gain resulting from retroactive reinsurance and subsequent changes in the deferred gain - Retroactive reinsurance agreements economically transfer risk to the reinsurers and excluding the deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance and related amortization of the deferred gain from core earnings provides greater insight into the economics of the business.\n•\nChange in valuation allowance on deferred taxes related to non-core components of before tax income - These changes in valuation allowances are excluded from core earnings because they relate to non-core components of before tax income, such as tax attributes like capital loss carryforwards. \n•\nResults of discontinued operations - These results are excluded from core earnings for businesses sold or held for sale because such results could obscure the ability to compare period over period results for our ongoing businesses.\nIn addition to the above components of net income available to common stockholders that are excluded from core earnings, preferred stock dividends declared, which are excluded from net income, are included in the determination of core earnings. Preferred stock dividends are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding. \nNet income (loss) and net income (loss) available to common stockholders are the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to core earnings. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or net income (loss) available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders, and core earnings when reviewing the Company's performance. \n39\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nReconciliation of Net Income to Core Earnings\n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n3,111\n \n$\n2,504\n \n$\n1,819\n \nPreferred stock dividends\n21 \n21 \n21 \nNet income available to common stockholders\n3,090\n \n2,483\n \n1,798\n \nAdjustments to reconcile net income available to common stockholders to core earnings:\nNet realized losses excluded from core earnings, before tax \n56 \n152 \n626 \nRestructuring and other costs, before tax\n2 \n6 \n13 \nLoss on extinguishment of debt, before tax\n— \n— \n9 \nIntegration and other non-recurring M&A costs, before tax\n8 \n8 \n21 \nChange in deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance, before tax\n(83)\n194 \n229 \nIncome tax expense (benefit) [1]\n3 \n(76)\n(200)\nCore earnings\n$\n3,076\n \n$\n2,767\n \n$\n2,496\n \n[1] Primarily represents the federal income tax expense (benefit) related to before tax items not included in core earnings.\nCore Earnings Margin-\n The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings margin to evaluate, and believes it is an important measure of, the Employee Benefits segment's operating performance. Core earnings margin is calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues, excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income margin, calculated by dividing net income by revenues, is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of Employee Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains (losses) as well as other items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. Core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of Employee Benefits. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and net income margin when reviewing performance. A reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Employee Benefits.\nCurrent Accident Year Catastrophe Ratio-\n A component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, represents the ratio of catastrophe losses incurred in the current accident year (\"CAY\") (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums. For U.S. events, a catastrophe is an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers, as defined by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk. For international events, the Company's approach is similar, informed, in part, by how Lloyd's of London defines major losses. Lloyd's of London is an insurance market-place operating worldwide (\"Lloyd's\"). Lloyd's does not underwrite risks. The Company accepts risks as the sole member of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 (\"Lloyd's Syndicate\"). The current accident year catastrophe ratio includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement premiums.\nExpense Ratio- \nFor Business Insurance and Personal Insurance is the ratio of underwriting expenses less fee income, to earned premiums. Underwriting expenses include the \namortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\"), amortization of other intangible assets and insurance operating costs and other expenses, including certain centralized services costs and bad debt expense. DAC includes commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other incremental direct underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term.\nThe expense ratio for Employee Benefits is expressed as the ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses including amortization of intangibles and amortization of DAC, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums.\nThe expense ratio for Business Insurance, Personal Insurance and Employee Benefits does not include integration and other transaction costs associated with an acquired business.\nFee Income- \nIs largely driven from amounts earned as a result of contractually defined percentages of AUM in our Hartford Funds business. These fees are generally earned on a daily basis. Therefore, this fee income increases or decreases with the rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.\nGross New Business Premium- \nRepresents the amount of premiums charged, before ceded reinsurance, for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. Gross new business premium plus gross renewal written premium less ceded reinsurance equals total written premium. \nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio-\n A measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. Among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the Company to achieve its targeted return on equity (\"ROE\") fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.\n40\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. Claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. Claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. As one of the factors used to determine pricing, the Company’s practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the rate-making process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage.\nUnderlying Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio- \nThis non-GAAP financial measure is the cost of non-catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year development (\"PYD\"). A reconciliation of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio to the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is set forth in the Reportable Segment and Corporate Operating Summaries section within MD&A.\nLoss Ratio, excluding Buyouts- \nUtilized for the Employee Benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses, excluding those related to buyout premiums, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. Since Employee Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the profitability of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. Buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts.\nNet investment income excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments-\n This non-GAAP measure is the amount of net investment income on a consolidated level earned from invested assets, excluding the net investment income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments. The Company believes that net investment income excluding limited partnerships and other alternative instruments, provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings because it excludes the impact of the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships and other alternative instruments. Net investment income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net investment income to net investment income excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments - is set forth in the Investment Results section within MD&A.\nMutual Fund and Exchange-Traded Fund Assets-\n Are owned by the shareowners of those products and not by the Company and, therefore, are not reflected in the Company’s \nConsolidated Financial Statements, except in instances where the Company seeds new investment products. \nMutual fund and ETF assets are a measure used by the Company primarily because a significant portion of the Company’s Hartford Funds segment revenues and expenses are based upon asset values. These revenues and expenses increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.\nNet New Business Premium-\n Represents the amount of premiums charged, after ceded reinsurance, for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. Net new business premium plus renewal written premium equals total written premium.\nPolicy Count Retention- \nRepresents the number of renewal policies issued during the current year period divided by the new and renewal policies issued in the prior period. Policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by us and competitors.\nEffective Policy Count Retention- \nRepresents the number of policies expected to renew in the current year period, based on contract effective dates, divided by the new and renewal policies effective in the prior period. Effective policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Effective policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by us and competitors, as well as the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals by customers. Effective policy count retention statistics are subject to change from period to period based on the effect of differences between actual and expected policy cancellations throughout the policy period.\nPolicies in-force-\n Represents the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. The number of policies in-force is a growth measure used for Personal Insurance, small business, and middle market lines within middle & large business, and is affected by both new business growth and policy count retention.\nPolicyholder Dividend Ratio-\n The ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium.\nPremium Retention-\n For middle & large business, represents the ratio of prior period premiums that were successfully renewed divided by premiums associated with policies available for renewal in the current period. Premium retention excludes premium amounts from annual audits, renewal written price increases and changes in exposure, including amount of insurance. Premium retention statistics are subject to change from period to period based on a number of factors, including the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals\n.\n41\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPrior Accident Year Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio-\n Represents the increase (decrease) in the estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums.\nReinstatement Premiums-\n Represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of the Company ceding losses to reinsurers.\nRenewal Earned Price Increase (Decrease)- \nWritten premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain personal automobile business and twelve months for substantially all of the remainder of the Company’s P&C business. Since the Company earns premiums over the six to twelve month term of the policies, renewal earned price increases (decreases) lag renewal written price increases (decreases) by six to twelve months.\nRenewal Written Price Increase (Decrease)- \nFor Business Insurance, represents the combined effect of rate changes, and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure on policies that renewed and includes amount of insurance. For Personal Insurance, renewal written price increases represent the total change in premium per policy since the prior year on those policies that renewed and includes the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and other changes in exposure. For Personal Insurance, other changes in exposure include, but are not limited to, the effect of changes in number of drivers, vehicles and incidents, as well as changes in customer policy elections, such as deductibles and limits. The rate component represents the change in rate impacting renewal policies as previously filed with and approved by state regulators during the period. Amount of insurance represents the change in the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for automobiles, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers’ compensation. A number of factors affect renewal written price increases (decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the Company’s pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the Company’s underwriters and marketplace competition. Renewal written price changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. Prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. Renewal written price statistics are subject to change from period to period, based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates and the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals, and modifications made to better reflect ultimate pricing achieved.\nReturn on Assets (\"ROA\"), Core Earnings-\nThe Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the Hartford Funds segment’s operating performance. ROA, core earnings is calculated by dividing annualized core earnings by a daily average AUM. ROA is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that ROA, core earnings, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Hartford Funds segment because it reveals trends in our business that may be obscured by the effect of items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. ROA, core earnings, should not be considered as a substitute for ROA and does not reflect the overall profitability of our Hartford Funds business. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both ROA, and ROA, core earnings when reviewing the Hartford Funds segment performance. A reconciliation of ROA to ROA, core earnings is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Hartford Funds.\nUnderlying Combined Ratio-\nThis non-GAAP financial measure of underwriting results represents the combined ratio before catastrophes, prior accident year development and current accident year change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development. The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are excluded from underlying combined ratio because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our investors' ability to assess the Company's financial performance. A reconciliation of combined ratio to underlying combined ratio is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Business Insurance and Personal Insurance.\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)-\n The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the Business and Personal Insurance segments primarily on the basis of underwriting gain or loss. Underwriting gain (loss) is a before tax non-GAAP measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that underwriting gain (loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the Company's investing activities.\n \n42\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Management believes that written premium is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company’s sale of property and casualty insurance products. Written and earned premium are recorded net of ceded reinsurance premium.\nTraditional life and disability insurance type products, such as those sold by Employee Benefits, collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection for the policyholder from a specified insurable loss, such as death or disability. These premiums, together with net investment income earned, are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts.\nTwo major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. Sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, customer demand for the Company’s product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and the Company’s reputation and ratings. Persistency refers to the percentage of premium remaining in-force from year-to-year.\nTHE HARTFORD'S OPERATIONS\nThe Hartford conducts business principally in five reportable segments including Business Insurance, Personal Insurance, Property & Casualty Other Operations, Employee Benefits and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category. The Company includes in the Corporate category capital raising activities (including equity financing, debt financing and related interest expense), purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill, reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, restructuring costs, transaction expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition, certain M&A costs, and other expenses not allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate also includes investment management fees and expenses related to managing third-party assets. \nThe Company derives its revenues principally from: (a) premiums earned for insurance coverage provided to insureds; (b) management fees on mutual fund and ETF assets; (c) net investment income; (d) fees earned for services provided to third parties; and (e) net realized gains and losses. Premiums charged for insurance coverage are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in-force.\n43\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe profitability of the Company's property and casualty insurance businesses over time is greatly influenced by the Company’s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance, the size of its in force block, making reliable estimates of actual mortality and morbidity, and its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other insurance operating costs. Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company’s response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover insurance operating costs and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments and the Lloyd's Syndicate's ability to write business is subject to Lloyd's approval for its premium capacity each year. Most of Personal Insurance written premium is associated with our exclusive licensing agreement with AARP, which is effective through December 31, 2032. This agreement provides an important competitive advantage given the size of the 50 plus population and the strength of the AARP brand. \nSimilar to property and casualty, profitability of the Employee Benefits business depends, in large part, on the ability to evaluate and price risks appropriately and make reliable estimates of mortality, morbidity, disability and longevity. To manage the pricing risk, Employee Benefits generally offers term insurance policies, allowing for the adjustment of rates or policy terms in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, loss costs, declining interest rates and other factors. However, as policies are typically sold with rate guarantees an average of three years, pricing for the Company’s products could prove to be inadequate if loss and expense trends emerge adversely during the rate guarantee period or if investment returns are lower than expected at the time the products were sold. For some of its products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments. New and renewal business for employee benefits business, particularly for LTD, are priced using an assumption about expected investment yields over time. While the Company employs asset-liability duration matching strategies to mitigate \nrisk and may use interest-rate sensitive derivatives to hedge its exposure in the Employee Benefits investment portfolio, cash flow patterns related to the payment of benefits and claims are uncertain and actual investment yields could differ significantly from expected investment yields, affecting profitability of the business. In addition to appropriately evaluating and pricing risks, the profitability of the Employee Benefits business depends on other factors, including the Company’s response to pricing decisions and other actions taken by competitors, its ability to offer voluntary products and self-service capabilities, the persistency of its sold business and its ability to manage its expenses which it seeks to achieve through economies of scale and operating efficiencies.\nThe financial results of the Company’s mutual fund and ETF businesses depend largely on the amount of AUM and the level of fees charged based, in part, on asset share class and fund type. Changes in AUM are driven by the two main factors of net flows and the market return of the funds, which are heavily influenced by the return realized in the equity and bond markets. Net flows are comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund and ETF shareowners. Financial results are highly correlated to the growth in AUM since these funds generally earn fee income on a daily basis.\nThe investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company’s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses are paid. Due to the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations, the majority of the Company’s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale (\"AFS\") securities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities (\"ABS\") and collateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\"). The Company also invests in commercial mortgage loans as well as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, which are private investments that are less liquid, but have the potential to generate higher returns. The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient net of tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. Investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.\n44\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nREVENUE\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums \nincreased by $1,541 or 7% primarily due to:\n•\nAn increase in P&C reflecting a 9% increase in Business Insurance and a 12% increase in Personal Insurance.\n–\nContributing to the increase in Business Insurance was the effect of an increase in new business across most lines of business, earned pricing increases, and higher insured exposures, principally in workers’ compensation and property lines.\n–\nFor Personal Insurance, earned premium increased primarily due to the effect of earned pricing increases, partially offset by non-renewals.\n•\nAn increase in Employee Benefits earned premium of 2% including an increase in exposure on existing accounts, new business sales, and persistency in excess of 90%.\nFee income\n increased primarily due to a $62 increase in Hartford Funds driven by higher daily average assets resulting from an increase in equity market levels, partially offset by net outflows over the preceding twelve month period.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income \nincreased primarily due to a higher level of invested assets and the impact of higher reinvestment rates, partially offset by a lower level of income on limited partnerships and other alternative investments.\nNet realized losses\n improved primarily due to: \n•\nLosses on credit derivatives in the 2023 period;\n•\nGains on transactional foreign currency revaluation in the 2024 period compared to losses in the 2023 period; and\n•\nA favorable change in the ACL on mortgage loans and fewer net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS.\nThese improvements were partially offset by:\n•\nGreater net losses on sales of fixed maturities.\nFor further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results, Net Investment Income and MD&A - Investment Results, Net Realized Gains (Losses).\n47\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBENEFITS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES\nLosses and LAE Incurred for P&C\nBenefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses\n increased $636, due to:\n•\nAn increase in Property & Casualty of $637, which was attributable to:\n–\nAn increase in P&C CAY loss and LAE before catastrophes of $675, before tax, primarily due to the effect of higher earned premiums, partially offset by a lower underlying loss and LAE ratio in Personal Insurance; and\n–\nAn increase in CAY catastrophe losses of $92, before tax. Catastrophe losses in the 2024 period included losses from tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, as well as hurricanes and tropical storms primarily in the Southeast, South and Mid-Atlantic regions, and, to a lesser extent, from winter storms, primarily in the Pacific, Northeast, and South regions. Catastrophe losses in the 2023 period included losses from tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, and losses from winter storms along the East and West Coasts.\nEmployee Benefits Losses and LAE Incurred\nPartially offset by:\n–\nA favorable change of $130, before tax, in P&C net prior accident year reserve development, with development in the 2024 period of a net favorable $120, before tax, and development in the 2023 period of a net unfavorable $10, before tax. Among other reserve changes, prior year reserve development included adverse development for A&E reserves of $203 and $194, before tax, in 2024 and 2023 respectively, of which $62 and $194, respectively, was ceded to NICO under the A&E ADC and accounted for as a deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting. The 2024 period also included a benefit of $145 related to amortization of the Navigators ADC deferred gain.  \nApart from the A&E reserve changes and the amortization of the Navigators ADC deferred gain, net favorable reserve development was $6 lower in 2024. Favorable prior year reserve development in the 2024 period was primarily driven by decreases in reserves related to workers' compensation, catastrophes, bond, personal automobile liability and physical damage, homeowners, professional liability and uncollectible reinsurance, partially offset by increases in reserves for general liability, commercial automobile liability, assumed reinsurance, and unallocated loss adjustment expense (\"ULAE\") reserves related to A&E reserves in P&C Other Operations. Favorable development in the 2023 period was primarily driven by decreases in reserves related to workers' compensation, catastrophes, bond and package, partially offset by increases in reserves for general liability, assumed reinsurance, personal automobile physical damage, and ULAE reserves related to A&E reserves in P&C Other Operations. \n48\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nGross gains and losses on sales \nwere primarily due to sales of U.S. treasuries, corporate securities, tax-exempt municipals, and CMBS largely to fund purchases of higher-yielding investments.\nEquity securities \nnet gains were primarily driven by an increase in value due to higher equity market levels.\nOther, net \ngains primarily included gains of $20 on transactional foreign currency revaluation and gains of $8 on interest rate derivatives driven by changes in interest rates.\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nGross gains and losses on sales \nwere primarily due to sales of corporate securities and tax-exempt municipals, in addition to sales of U.S. treasuries which were used to manage duration and liquidity, and to fund purchases of higher yielding investments.\nEquity securities \nnet gains were primarily driven by sales due to higher equity market levels.\nOther, net \nlosses were primarily driven by losses of $105 on credit derivatives due to tighter credit spreads and losses of $15 on transactional foreign currency revaluation. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates.\nThe Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:\n•\nproperty and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance;\n•\nemployee benefit LTD reserves, net of reinsurance;\n•\nevaluation of goodwill for impairment;\n•\nvaluation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and ACL on mortgage loans; and\n•\ncontingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.\nIn developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements. Certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n51\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Most of the Company’s policies provide for occurrence-based coverage where the loss is incurred when a claim event happens, like an automobile accident, house or building fire or injury to an employee under a workers’ compensation policy. Some of the Company's policies, mostly for directors and officers insurance and errors and omissions insurance, are claims-made policies where the loss is incurred in the period the claim event is reported to the Company even if the loss event itself occurred in an earlier period.\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves provide for the estimated ultimate costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company, less amounts paid to date. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of all claims and the actual loss and loss adjustment expenses reported to the \n52\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCompany by claimants to date (“reported losses”). Reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims. For most lines, Company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (IBNR and case reserves) on an accident year basis. An accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported. For certain lines, total reserves are evaluated on a policy year basis and then converted to accident year. A policy year is the calendar year in which a policy incepts. \nFactors that Change Reserve Estimates- \nReserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment. Higher than expected inflation in claim costs, such as with medical care, hospital care, automobile parts, wages, and home and building repair, would cause claims to settle for more than they are initially reserved. Changes in the economy can cause an increase or decrease in the number of reported claims (claim frequency). For example, an improving economy could result in more automobile miles driven and a higher number of automobile-related claims, or a change in economic conditions can lead to more or fewer workers’ compensation reported claims. An increase in the number or percentage of claims litigated can increase the average settlement amount per claim (claim severity). Changes in the judicial environment can affect interpretations of damages and how policy coverage applies, which could increase or decrease claim severity. Over time, judges or juries in certain jurisdictions may be more inclined to determine liability and award damages. New legislation can also change how damages are defined or change the statutes of limitations for the filing of civil suits, resulting in greater claim frequency or severity. In addition, new types of injuries may arise from exposures not contemplated when the policies were written. Past examples include pharmaceutical products, silica, lead paint, sexual molestation and sexual abuse and construction defects. Additionally, social inflationary pressures, such as increased litigation funding and aggressive tactics by plaintiff attorneys, can introduce the risk of potentially increasing jury awards and an increase in the percentage of litigated claims impacting both general liability and automobile claim frequency and severity.\nReserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal Company operations. A delay or acceleration in handling claims may signal a need to increase or reduce reserves from what was initially estimated. New lines of business may have loss development patterns that are not well established. Changes in the geographic mix of business, changes in the mix of business by industry and changes in the mix of business by policy limit or deductible can increase the risk that losses will ultimately develop differently than the loss development patterns assumed in our reserving. In addition, changes in the quality of risk selection in underwriting and changes in interpretations of policy language could increase or decrease ultimate losses from what was assumed in establishing the reserves.\nIn the case of assumed reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. The Company assumes property and casualty risks from other insurance companies as part of its Global Re business and from certain pools and associations. Global Re, which is a part of the global specialty business, mostly assumes property, casualty and specialty risks. Changes \nin the case reserving and reporting patterns of insurance companies ceding to The Hartford can \ncreate additional uncertainty in estimating the reserves. Due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates of direct and assumed reserves, particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future.\nReinsurance Recoverables- \nThrough both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the Company cedes a share of the risks it has underwritten to other insurance companies. The Company records reinsurance recoverables for losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded to its reinsurers representing the anticipated recovery from reinsurers of unpaid claims, including IBNR. \nThe Company estimates the portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses to be ceded based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of IBNR for losses that will ultimately be ceded.\nThe Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. The ACL primarily considers the credit quality of the Company's reinsurers while the allowance for disputes considers recent outcomes in arbitration and litigation in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and recent commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants that may signal how the Company’s own reinsurance claims may settle. Where its reinsurance contracts permit, the Company secures reinsurance recoverables with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $72 as of December 31, 2024, comprised of $30 related to Business Insurance, $1 related to Personal Insurance and $41 related to Property & Casualty Other Operations.\nThe Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for direct and assumed exposures.\nReview of Reserve Adequacy- \nThe Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business or more detailed level, taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. For Property & Casualty Other Operations, asbestos and environmental (“Run-off A&E”) reserves are reviewed by type of event rather than by line of business. \nReserve adjustments, which may be material, are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. In the judgment of management, information currently available has been properly considered in establishing the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and in recording the reinsurance recoverables for ceded unpaid losses.\nReserving Methodology\nThe following is a discussion of the reserving methods used for the Company's property and casualty lines of business other than asbestos and environmental.\n53\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nReserves are set by line of business within the operating segments. A single line of business may be written in more than one segment. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest-tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property, marine property and automobile physical damage. The longest-tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability, professional liability and assumed reinsurance. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.\nUse of Actuarial Methods and Judgments- \nThe Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. New methods may be added for specific lines over time to inform these selections where appropriate. The reserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. Some reserves are reviewed fully each quarter, including loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for commercial property, homeowners, personal automobile, and most workers’ compensation lines. Other reserves, including commercial automobile, marine, package business, and most general liability and professional liability lines, are reviewed semi-annually. Certain additional reserves are also reviewed semi-annually or annually, including reserves for losses incurred in accident years older than twelve years for Personal Insurance and older than twenty years for Business Insurance, as well as reserves for bond, assumed reinsurance, latent exposures such as construction defects, and ULAE. For reserves that are reviewed semi-annually or annually, management monitors the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters and, if warranted, performs a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change.\nAn expected loss ratio (\"ELR\") is used in initially recording the reserves for both short-tail and long-tail lines of business. This ELR is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year gives weight to both the initial ELR multiplied by earned premium approach as well as a loss development approach, given early reported losses are more credible than in long tailed lines. For long-tailed lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the ELR for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period.\nAs losses emerge or develop in periods subsequent to a given accident year, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the ELR method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the ELR method with the paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more weight vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates representing a range of actuarial indications.\nReserve Discounting- \nMost of the Company’s property and casualty insurance product reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted a portion of workers’ compensation reserves that have a fixed and determinable payment stream. For further discussion of these discounted liabilities, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDifferences Between GAAP and Statutory Basis Reserves- \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, U.S. property and casualty insurance product reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables, reported under U.S. GAAP were approximately $1.5 billion lower than net reserves reported on a statutory basis, primarily due to reinsurance recoverables on two adverse development cover reinsurance agreements that are recorded as a reduction of other liabilities under statutory accounting. For further discussion of these adverse development cover reinsurance agreements, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the effect of these retroactive reinsurance agreements, U.S. property and casualty insurance product reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables, reported under U.S. GAAP were approximately equal to net reserves reported on a statutory basis.\nReserving Methods by Line of Business- \nApart from Run-off A&E, which is discussed in the following section on Property & Casualty Other Operations, below is a general discussion of which reserving methods are preferred by line of business. Because the actuarial estimates are generated at a much finer level of detail than line of business (e.g., by distribution channel, coverage, accident period), other methods than those described for the line of business may also be employed for a coverage and accident year within a line of business. Also, as circumstances change, the methods that are given more weight will change.\n54\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPreferred Reserving Methods by Line of Business\nCommercial property, homeowners and automobile physical damage\nThese short-tailed lines are relatively fast-developing and paid and reported development techniques are used. These methods use historical data to generate paid and reported loss development patterns, which are then applied to cumulative paid and reported losses by accident period to estimate ultimate losses. In addition to paid and reported development methods, for the most immature accident months, the Company uses frequency/severity techniques and methods that incorporate the initial expected loss ratio (\"ELR\"). The advantage of frequency/severity techniques is that frequency estimates are generally more stable and external information can be used to supplement internal data in estimating average severity. For personal automobile physical damage, the Company also considers gross loss, salvage and subrogation estimates to project net ultimate losses for recent accident periods.\nPersonal automobile liability\nFor personal automobile liability, and bodily injury in particular, in addition to traditional paid and reported development methods, the Company relies on frequency/severity techniques and the initial ELR. The Company generally uses the reported development method for older accident years and a combination of reported development, frequency/severity and the initial ELR for more recent accident years. For older accident periods, reported losses are a good indicator of ultimate losses given the high percentage of ultimate losses reported to date. For more recent periods, where there is more uncertainty and a higher percentage of open and unreported claims, putting some reliance on frequency/severity and initial expectations is prudent. The Company supplements these standard actuarial methods with a comprehensive review of claims diagnostics such as attorney representation, litigation, settlement rates, large loss impacts, and case reserve adequacy.  Through reviewing the standard actuarial methods and claims diagnostics, a loss estimate can be calculated that considers these results and the age of the accident year that is being estimated.\nCommercial automobile liability\nThe Company performs a variety of techniques, including the paid and reported development methods and frequency/severity techniques. For older, more mature accident years, the Company primarily uses reported development techniques. For more recent accident years, the Company relies on several methods that incorporate ELR, reported loss development, paid loss development, and frequency/severity.\nProfessional liability\nReported and paid loss development patterns for this line tend to be volatile. Therefore, the Company typically supplements the ELR method and paid and reported development methods with others such as individual claim reviews and frequency and severity techniques.\nGeneral liability, bond and large deductible workers’ compensation\nFor these long-tailed lines of business, the Company generally relies on the ELR and paid and reported development techniques. The Company generally weights these techniques together, relying more heavily on the ELR method at early ages of development and shifting more weight onto paid and reported development methods as an accident year matures. The Company also uses various frequency/severity methods aimed at capturing large loss development and in some bond lines individual claim reviews are used.\nWorkers’ compensation\nWorkers’ compensation is the Company’s single largest reserve line of business and a wide range of methods are used. Due to the long-tailed nature of workers' compensation, the selection of methods is driven by ELR methods for recent accident years and then, as an accident year matures, shifting first to Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency/severity methods, then to paid and reported development methods, and finally to methods that are responsive to the inventory of open claims. Across these techniques, there are adjustments related to changes in emergence patterns across years, projections of future cost inflation, and outlier claims.\nMarine\nFor marine liability, the Company generally relies on the ELR, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, and reported development techniques. The Company generally weights these techniques together, relying more heavily on the ELR method at early ages of development and then shifts towards Bornhuetter-Ferguson and then more towards the reported development method as an accident year matures. For marine property segments, the Company relies on Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods for early development ages then shifts to reported development techniques.\nAssumed reinsurance and all other\nStandard methods, such as ELR, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and reported development techniques are applied. These methods are informed by underlying treaty analyses supporting the ELRs, and cedant data will often inform the loss development patterns. In some instances, reserve indications may also be influenced by information gained from claims and underwriting audits. Policy quarter and policy year loss reserve estimates are then converted to an accident year basis.\nAllocated loss adjustment expenses (\"ALAE\")\nFor some lines of business (e.g., professional liability, assumed reinsurance, and the acquired Navigators Group book of business), ALAE and losses are analyzed together. For most lines of business, however, ALAE is analyzed separately, using paid development techniques and a ratio of paid ALAE to paid loss applied to loss reserves to estimate unpaid ALAE.\nUnallocated loss adjustment expenses (\"ULAE\")\nULAE is analyzed separately from loss and ALAE. For most lines of business, future ULAE costs to be paid are projected based on a claim projection method that applies an expected claim handling cost per unit to projected claims, leveraging the anticipated claim closure pattern and the ratio of paid ULAE to paid loss applied to estimated unpaid losses. For some lines, a simplified paid-to-paid approach is used.\nThe recorded reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the Company's best estimate of the ultimate settlement amount of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. In applying judgment, the best estimate is selected after considering the estimates derived from a number of actuarial methods, giving more weight to those methods deemed more predictive of ultimate unpaid losses and loss \nadjustment expenses. The Company does not produce a statistical range or confidence interval of reserve estimates and, since reserving methods with more credibility are given greater weight, the selected best estimate may differ from the mid-point of the various estimates produced by the actuarial methods used. \n55\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAssumptions used in arriving at the selected actuarial indications consider a number of factors, including the immaturity of emerged claims in recent accident years, emerging trends in the recent past, and the level of volatility within each line of business. \nAdjustments to reserves for prior accident years are referred to as “prior accident year development”. Increases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either an increase in prior accident year reserves or as unfavorable reserve development. Decreases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either a decrease in prior accident year reserves or as favorable reserve development. Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results.\nFor a discussion of changes to reserve estimates recorded in 2024, see Note 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCurrent Trends Contributing to Reserve Uncertainty\nThe Hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty insurance business. The Hartford is, therefore, subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from changes in loss trends and other conditions which could become material at any point in time. As market conditions and loss trends develop, management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend that should result in a reserving action (i.e., increasing or decreasing reserves).\nGeneral liability- \nWithin Business Insurance and Property & Casualty Other Operations, the Company has exposure to general liability claims, including from bodily injury, property damage and product liability. Reserves for these exposures can be particularly difficult to estimate due to the long development pattern and uncertainty around how cases will settle. In particular, the Company has exposure to bodily injury claims that arise from long-term or continuous exposure to harmful products or substances. Examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\"), CTE exposures and lead paint. The Company also has exposure to claims from construction defects, where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. In addition, the Company has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions, and other organizations relating to sexual molestation and sexual abuse. For information related to the Company's settlement agreement with the Boy Scouts of America (\"BSA\"), see Note 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. State “reviver” statutes, extending statutes of limitations for certain sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims, could result in additional litigation or could result in unexpected sexual molestation and sexual abuse losses. Such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods, which can raise complex coverage issues with significant effects on the ultimate scope of coverage. Such exposures may also be impacted by insured bankruptcies. These factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims. With regard to these exposures, the Company monitors \ntrends in litigation, the external environment including legislation, the similarities to other mass torts and the potential impact on the Company’s reserves. The Company also monitors the effects of social inflation and the impact of increased litigation funding and aggressive trial tactics by plaintiff attorneys that can introduce the risk of potentially increasing jury awards and an increase in the percentage of litigated claims. Additionally, uncertainty in estimated claim severity causes reserve variability, including the effect of changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices.\nWorkers’ compensation-\n Included in both small business and middle & large business, workers’ compensation is the Company’s single biggest line of business, and the property and casualty line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. To the extent that patterns in the frequency of settlement payments deviate from historical patterns, loss reserve estimates would be less reliable. Medical costs make up approximately 50% of workers’ compensation payments. As such, reserve estimates for workers’ compensation are particularly sensitive to changes in medical inflation, the changing use of medical care procedures and changes in state legislative and regulatory environments. In addition, changes in the economic environment could reduce the ability of an injured worker to return to work and thus lengthen the time a worker receives disability benefits. In national accounts, reserves for large deductible workers’ compensation insurance require estimating losses attributable to the deductible amount that will be paid by the insured; if such losses are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the Company is contractually liable. \nCommercial automobile- \nUncertainty in estimated claim severity causes reserve variability for commercial automobile losses including reserve variability due to changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as due to changes in the external environment, including but not limited to the impacts of social inflation mentioned in the general liability section above and many of the same drivers detailed in the personal automobile section below. \nDirectors and officers insurance- \nUncertainty regarding the number and severity of security class action suits can result in reserve volatility for directors and officers insurance claims. Additionally, the Company’s exposure to losses under directors and officers insurance policies, both domestically and internationally, is primarily in excess layers, making estimates of loss more complex. \nPersonal automobile- \nWhile claims emerge over relatively shorter periods, estimates can still vary due to a number of factors, including uncertain estimates of frequency and severity trends. Severity trends are affected by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as by changes in the external environment, such as due to inflation in labor and materials because of supply chain disruptions affecting repair costs. Severity trends can also be impacted by social inflation whereby increased litigation funding and aggressive trial tactics by plaintiff attorneys can introduce the risk of potentially increasing jury awards and an increase in the percentage of litigated claims. Changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. Severity trends have increased in recent accident years, in part driven by more expensive parts associated with new automobile \n56\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ntechnology and increased attorney representation, causing additional uncertainty about the reliability of past patterns. In addition, the introduction of new products and class plans can lead to a different mix of business by type of insured than the Company experienced in the past. Changes in mix increase the uncertainty of the reserve projections since historical data and reporting patterns may not be applicable to the new business. \nAssumed reinsurance- \nWhile pricing and reserving processes can be challenging and idiosyncratic for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of setting prices and estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer. This is primarily due to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of claims to the reinsurer, the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or contracts, the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing pricing and reserving practices among ceding companies. In addition, trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or impact liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future. As a result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the expected estimates.\nInternational business-\n In addition to several of the line-specific trends listed above, international business may have additional uncertainty due to geopolitical, foreign currency, and trade dispute risks. \nCatastrophes-\n \nWithin Business Insurance and Personal Insurance, the Company is exposed to losses from catastrophe events, primarily for damage to property. Reserves for hurricanes, tropical storms, tornado/hail, wildfires, earthquakes and other catastrophe events are subject to significant uncertainty about the number and average severity of claims arising from those events, particularly in cases where the event occurs near the end of a financial reporting period when there is limited information about the extent of damages. For example, after a catastrophe event, it may take a period of time before we are able to access the impacted areas limiting the ability of our claims adjusting staff to inspect losses, make estimates and determine the damages that are covered by the policy. To estimate catastrophe losses, we consider information from claim notices received to date, third party data, visual images of the affected area where we have exposures and our own historical experience of loss reporting patterns for similar events.\nImpact of Key Assumptions on Reserves \nAs stated above, the Company’s practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods, assumptions, and data elements within its reserve estimation. The Company does not use statistical loss distributions or confidence levels in the process of determining its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not disclose reserve ranges.\nAcross most lines of business, the most important reserve assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. The trend in loss cost frequency and severity is also a key assumption, particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.\nThe following discussion discloses possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key indicators of potential losses. For automobile liability lines in both Personal Insurance and Business Insurance, the key indicator is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs. For workers’ compensation and general liability, loss development patterns are a key indicator, particularly for more mature accident years. For workers’ compensation, paid loss development patterns have been impacted by medical cost inflation and other changes in loss cost trends. For general liability, incurred loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims (e.g., PFAS claims) and a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims. \nEach of the impacts described below is estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key indicators or among lines of business. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the Company’s reserves in total. For any one reserving line of business, the estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key indicators is a reasonable estimate of potential reserve development that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several calendar years. The variation discussed is not meant to be a worst-case scenario, and, therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than the amounts discussed below. Moreover, the variation discussed does not represent a statistical range of potential reserve outcomes, and factors exist beyond the key indicators considered which have the potential to drive additional variation to the Company's reserves.\nPossible Change in Key Indicator\nReserves, Net of Reinsurance December 31, 2024\nEstimated Range of Potential Reserve Development\nPersonal Automobile\nLiability\n+/- 2.5 points to the annual assumed change in loss cost severity for the two most recent accident years\n$1.7 billion\n+/- $90\nCommercial Automobile Liability\n+/- 2.5 points to the annual assumed change in loss cost severity for the two most recent accident years\n$1.6 billion\n+/- $50\nWorkers' Compensation\n2% change in paid loss development patterns\n$12.7 billion\n+/- $400\nGeneral Liability\n8% change in reported loss development patterns\n$5.9 billion\n+/- $700\n57\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nReserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims\nHow A&E Reserves are Set-\n The process for establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims first involves estimating the required reserves gross of ceded reinsurance and then estimating reinsurance recoverables.\nIn establishing reserves for gross asbestos claims, the Company evaluates its insureds’ estimated liabilities for such claims by examining exposures for individual insureds and assessing how coverage applies. The Company considers a variety of factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and anticipated future claim activity, the level of plaintiff demands, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal rates, allocated loss adjustment expense, and potential impact of other defendants being in bankruptcy.\nSimilarly, the Company reviews exposures to establish gross environmental reserves. The Company considers several factors in estimating environmental liabilities, including historical values of similar claims, the number of sites involved, the insureds’ alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, the appropriateness and cost of remediation, the nature of governmental enforcement activities or mandated remediation efforts and potential impact of other defendants being in bankruptcy.\nAfter evaluating its insureds’ probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the Company evaluates the insurance coverage in place for such claims. The Company considers its insureds’ total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the Company. The Company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language, the nature of how policy limits are enforced on multi-year policies and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.\nThe estimated liabilities of insureds and the Company’s exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This analysis is conducted by the Company’s lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.\nFor both asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company also analyzes its historical paid and reported losses and expenses year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity. The historical losses and expenses are analyzed on both a direct basis and net of reinsurance. \nOnce the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expense is determined for its insureds by each policy year, the Company calculates its ceded reinsurance \nrecoverables based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the Company’s experience with reinsurance collections. See the section that follows entitled A&E Adverse Development Cover that discusses the impact the reinsurance agreement with NICO may have on future adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves, if any.\nUncertainties Regarding Adequacy of A&E Reserves- \nA number of factors affect the variability of estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment, resolution of coverage disputes with our policyholders and the expense to indemnity ratio. Reserve estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to greater variability than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures. \nThe process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. Future developments could continue to cause the Company to change its estimates of its gross asbestos and environmental reserves. Losses ceded under the adverse development cover (\"A&E ADC\") with NICO in excess of the ceded premium paid of $650 have resulted in a deferred gain resulting in a timing difference between when gross reserves are increased and when reinsurance recoveries are recognized. This timing difference results in a charge to net income until such periods when the recoveries are recognized. Consistent with past practice, the Company will continue to monitor its reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations regularly, including its annual reviews of asbestos liabilities, reinsurance recoverables, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, and environmental liabilities. Where future developments indicate, we will make appropriate adjustments to the reserves at that time.\nTotal P&C Insurance Product Reserves Development\nIn the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2024 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. However, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves, it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change in the future and that the required adjustment to currently recorded reserves could be material to the Company’s results of operations or liquidity.\n58\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

The “all other” category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability for lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, head injuries, sexual molestation and sexual abuse and other long-tail liabilities. In addition to various insurance and assumed reinsurance exposures, \"all other\" includes unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. \"All other\" also includes the Company’s allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. When the Company commutes a ceded reinsurance contract or settles a ceded reinsurance dispute, net reserves for the related cause of loss (including asbestos, environmental or all other) are \nincreased for the portion of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance attributable to that commutation or settlement. \nAsbestos and Environmental Reserves\nThe vast majority of the Company's exposure to A&E relates to policy coverages provided prior to 1986 and is reported within the P&C Other Operations segment (“Run-off A&E”). In addition, since 1986 the Company has written A&E exposures under general liability policies and pollution liability under homeowners policies, which are reported in the Business Insurance and Personal Insurance segments, respectively.\n64\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Under the A&E ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion, including both Run-off A&E and A&E reserves in Business Insurance and \nPersonal Insurance. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed in a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The A&E ADC covered substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit, which as of December 31, 2024, has been exhausted.\n65\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnder retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 results in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid have been recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid have resulted in a deferred gain. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has exhausted the treaty limit and incurred a cumulative $1.5 billion in adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO, including $1,538 for Run-off A&E reserves, partially offset by a $38 reduction for A&E reserves in Business Insurance and Personal Insurance. As such, no remaining coverage is available for any future adverse net reserve development, which may be significant. The Company has recorded a $850 deferred gain within other liabilities, representing the difference between the reinsurance recoverable of $1.5 billion and ceded premium paid of $650. \nRecoveries from NICO will be collected once the Company has paid cumulative losses in excess of the $1.7 billion attachment point. T\nhe deferred gain will be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries.\nNet and Gross Survival Ratios\nNet and gross survival ratios are a measure of the quotient of the carried reserves divided by average annual payments (net of reinsurance and on a gross basis) and is an indication of the number of years that carried reserves would last (i.e., survive) if future annual payments were consistent with the calculated historical average.\nSince December 31, 2016, asbestos and environmental net reserves have been declining since all adverse development has been ceded to NICO, up to the limit of $1.5 billion, and the deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance has been recorded within other liabilities rather than in net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. \nRecoveries from NICO will not be collected until the Company has cumulative loss payments of more than the attachment point of $1.7 billion, which was based on the carrying value of net reserves as of December 31, 2016.  \nAccordingly, the payment of losses without any current collection of recoveries from NICO has reduced the Company’s net loss reserves which decreases the net survival ratios such that, unadjusted, the net survival ratios would not be representative of the true number of years of average loss payments covered by the reserves. Therefore, the net survival ratios presented in the table below are calculated before considering the effect of the A&E ADC reinsurance agreement but net of other reinsurance in place. \nNet and Gross Survival Ratios\nAsbestos\nEnvironmental\nOne year net survival ratio\n11.5\n7.7\nThree year net survival ratio\n11.3\n6.9\nOne year gross survival ratio\n11.7\n5.8\nThree year gross survival ratio\n11.4\n6.4\nRun-off A&E Paid and Incurred Losses and LAE Development \nAsbestos\nEnvironmental\nTotal A&E\nPaid Losses & LAE\nIncurred Losses & LAE\nPaid Losses & LAE\nIncurred Losses & LAE\nPaid Losses & LAE\nIncurred Losses & LAE\n2024\n \n \n \n \nGross\n$\n159 \n$\n206 \n$\n75 \n$\n49 \n$\n234 \n$\n255 \nCeded- other than NICO\n(39)\n(39)\n(26)\n(13)\n(65)\n(52)\nNet - Gross of ADC\n$\n120 \n$\n167 \n$\n49 \n$\n36 \n169 \n203 \nCeded - NICO A&E ADC \n— \n(62)\nNet\n$\n169\n \n$\n141\n \n2023\n \n \n \n \nGross\n$\n171 \n$\n206 \n$\n24 \n$\n49 \n$\n195 \n$\n255 \nCeded- other than NICO\n(51)\n(50)\n1 \n(11)\n(50)\n(61)\nNet - Gross of ADC\n$\n120 \n$\n156 \n$\n25 \n$\n38 \n145 \n194 \nCeded - NICO A&E ADC \n— \n(194)\nNet\n$\n145\n \n$\n—\n \n2022\nGross\n$\n160 \n$\n227 \n$\n106 \n$\n80 \n$\n266 \n$\n307 \nCeded- other than NICO\n(32)\n(66)\n(17)\n(12)\n(49)\n(78)\nNet - Gross of ADC\n$\n128 \n$\n161 \n$\n89 \n$\n68 \n217 \n229 \nCeded - NICO A&E ADC \n— \n(229)\nNet\n$\n217\n \n$\n—\n \n66\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAnnual Reserve Reviews\nReview of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves\nThe Company performs its regular comprehensive annual review of asbestos and environmental reserves in the fourth quarter, including both Run-off A&E (P&C Other Operations) and asbestos and environmental reserves included in Business Insurance and Personal Insurance. As part of the evaluation of asbestos and environmental reserves in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos and environmental liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts. \n2024 comprehensive annual reviews\nAs a result of the 2024 fourth quarter review, the Company increased asbestos reserves before NICO reinsurance by $167 in P&C Other Operations, primarily driven by higher-than-expected frequency, higher settlement values for certain accounts, an increase in the Company’s share of liability due to insolvencies and cost sharing agreements and an increase in claim settlement rates. \nAs a result of the 2024 fourth quarter review, the Company increased environmental reserves before NICO reinsurance by $36 in P&C Other Operations, primarily due to higher severity on recently emerged accounts, higher environmental site cleanup and monitoring costs, and higher legal expenses.\nThe total $203 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves was charged to earnings in 2024 within P&C Other Operations, which includes $62 that was ceded to the NICO ADC and recorded as a deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has ceded the cumulative treaty limit of $1.5 billion and as such, any future adverse development will be charged to earnings. \n2023 comprehensive annual reviews\nAs a result of the 2023 fourth quarter review, the Company increased asbestos reserves before NICO reinsurance by $156 in P&C Other Operations, primarily driven by an increase in the Company’s share of liability due to insolvencies and cost sharing agreements, an increase in claim settlement rates, as well as higher defense costs. The increase in asbestos reserves was offset by a $156 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty.\nAs a result of the 2023 fourth quarter review, the Company increased environmental reserves before NICO reinsurance by $38 in P&C Other Operations, primarily due to higher severity \non recently emerged accounts, higher environmental site cleanup and monitoring costs, including increased estimates of liability for PFAS exposures, and higher legal expenses. The increase in environmental reserves was offset by a $38 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty.\nThe total $194 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves in P&C Other Operations was offset by a $194 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty. Since cumulative losses ceded to the A&E ADC exceed the $650 of ceded premium paid, the Company recognized a $194 increase in deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance, resulting in the Company recording a charge to earnings of $194 in 2023.\nFor information regarding the 2022 comprehensive annual review, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in The Hartford’s 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report.\nReview of \"All Other\" Reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations\nPrior year development on all other reserves resulted in increases of $16, $30 and $51, respectively for calendar years 2024, 2023 and 2022. Included in the 2024 adverse reserve development was an increase in ULAE reserves, primarily due to an increase in expected aggregate claim handling costs associated with asbestos and environmental claims.\nThe Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. In performing its assessment, the Company evaluates the collectibility of the reinsurance recoverables and the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in Property & Casualty Other Operations. In conducting these evaluations, the Company used its most recent detailed evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment. The Company analyzed the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers, and recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants. As of 2024, 2023, and 2022 the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for Property & Casualty Other Operations totaled $41, $53 and $56, respectively. Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, particularly for older, long-term casualty liabilities, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required. \n|\nIMPACT OF RE-ESTIMATES ON PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCT RESERVES \nEstimating property and casualty insurance product reserves uses a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. Ultimate losses may vary materially from the current estimates. Many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous estimate of required reserve levels. Prior accident year reserve development is generally due to the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and/or due to changes in interpretations of information and trends.\nThe table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by The Hartford over the past ten years. The range of prior accident year development shown in the table below is net of losses ceded, including losses ceded under two adverse development cover reinsurance agreements with NICO that are accounted for as a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance. The amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve rollforward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year reserves, net of \n67\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nreinsurance. The ranges presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last ten years are included in the range. Accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability. For further \ndiscussion of the potential for variability in recorded loss reserves, see Preferred Reserving Methods by Line of Business and Impact of Key Assumptions on Reserves sections.\nRange of Prior Accident Year Unfavorable (Favorable) Development for the Ten Years Ended December 31, 2024\nBusiness Insurance\nPersonal \nInsurance\nProperty & Casualty Other Operations\nTotal Property & Casualty [1]\nAnnual range of prior accident year unfavorable (favorable) development for the ten years ended December 31, 2024\n(1.3%) - 0.4%\n(20.5%) - 8.3%\n0.9% - 21.6%\n(1.9%) - 2.4%\n[1]\nExcluding the reserve increases for asbestos and environmental reserves, over the past ten years, reserve re-estimates for total property and casualty insurance ranged from (1.9%) to 1.0%.\nThe potential variability of the Company’s property and casualty insurance product reserves would normally be expected to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments. Illustrative factors influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are discussed under Critical Accounting Estimates for Property & Casualty Insurance \nProduct Reserves and Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. See the section entitled Property & Casualty Other Operations, Annual Reserve Reviews about the impact that the A&E ADC retroactive reinsurance agreement with NICO has on net reserve changes of asbestos and environmental reserves.\n|\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT LTD RESERVES, NET OF REINSURANCE\nThe Company establishes reserves for group life and accident & health contracts, including long-term disability coverage, for both reported claims and claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported. As long-term disability reserves are long-tail claim liabilities, they are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The Company held $6,609 and $6,619 of LTD unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nReserving Methodology\nHow Reserves are Set - \nA Disabled Life Reserve (\"DLR\") is calculated for each LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all future benefit payments starting with the known monthly gross benefit which is reduced for estimates of the expected claim recovery due to return to work or claimant death, offsets from other income including offsets from Social Security benefits, and discounting, where the discount rate is tied to expected investment yield at the time the claim is incurred. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. For claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability. In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR. \nThe DLR also includes a liability for potential payments to pending claimants beyond the elimination period who have not yet been approved for LTD. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience. \nEstimates for IBNR claims are made by applying completion factors to expected emerged experience by line of business. Included within IBNR are bulk reserves for claims reported but still within the waiting period until benefits are paid, typically 3 or 6 months depending on the contract. Completion factors are derived from standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The reserves include an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.\nFor all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and line of business, where emerged claims for an incurral year are not yet credible enough to be a basis for estimating reserves. In these cases, the ultimate loss is estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio based on pricing assumptions of claim incidence, claim severity, and earned pricing adjusted for emerging trends as needed.\nImpact of Key Assumptions on Reserves\nThe key assumptions affecting long-term disability, which is the largest reserve within Employee Benefits, include:\nDiscount Rate - \nThe discount rate is the interest rate at which expected future claim cash flows are discounted to determine the present value. A higher selected discount rate results in a lower reserve. If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to cover the discount accretion on our claim reserves which would negatively affect our profits. For each incurral year, the discount rates are estimated based on \n68\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ninvestment yields expected to be earned net of investment expenses. The incurral year is the year in which the claim is incurred and the estimated settlement pattern is determined. Once established, discount rates for each incurral year are unchanged except that LTD reserves assumed from the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business are all discounted using rates as of the November 1, 2017 acquisition date. The weighted average discount rate on LTD reserves was 3.3% and 3.2% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Had the discount rate for each incurral year been 10 basis points lower at the time they were established, our LTD unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be higher by $30, before tax, as of December 31, 2024.\nClaim Termination Rates (inclusive of mortality, recoveries, and expiration of benefits) - \nClaim termination rates are an estimate of the rate at which claimants will cease receiving benefits during a given calendar year. Terminations result from a number of factors, including death, recoveries and expiration of benefits. The probability that benefits will terminate in each future month for each claim is estimated using a predictive model that uses past Company experience, contract provisions, job characteristics and other claimant-specific characteristics such as diagnosis, time since disability began, and age. Actual claim termination experience will vary from period to period. Over the past 10 years, claim \ntermination rates for a single incurral year have generally increased and have ranged from 7% below to 7% above current assumptions over that time period. For a single recent incurral year (such as 2024), a one percent decrease in our assumption for LTD claim termination rates would increase our reserves by $13. For all incurral years combined, as of December 31, 2024, a one percent decrease in our assumption for our LTD claim termination rates would increase our Employee Benefits unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by $29.\nCurrent Trends Contributing to Reserve Uncertainty\nWe have observed delays in the Social Security Administration’s processing of disability claims, which reduces or slows down the recognition of offsets to claimant benefits. If we have a downturn in the economy and/or in employment levels, we could experience an increase in claim incidence on long-term disability claims.\nBy investing in fixed income securities of similar duration to our liabilities, we hedge our interest rate exposure over a three year period at the time we price and sell long-term disability policies given average three year rate guarantees. Our weighted average discount rate assumption for the 2024 incurral year is up from that of the 2023 incurral year.\n|\nEVALUATION OF GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT\nGoodwill balances are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. The recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its estimated fair value, up to the amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. \nThe estimated fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital, future business growth, earnings projections, assets under management for Hartford Funds and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a \nreporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairment.\nA reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated consist of Business Insurance, Personal Insurance, Employee Benefits and Hartford Funds.\nThe annual goodwill assessment for the reporting units was completed as of October 31, 2024, and resulted in no write-downs of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2024. All reporting units passed the annual impairment test with a significant margin. For information on goodwill see Note 9 - Goodwill & Other Intangible Assets of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n|\nVALUATION OF INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS \nFixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments, and Derivatives\nThe Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a \"waterfall\" approach comprised of the following pricing sources which are listed in priority order: quoted prices, prices from third-party pricing \nservices, internal matrix pricing, and independent broker quotes. The fair values of derivative instruments are determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded transactions and transactions cleared through central clearing houses (\"OTC-cleared\") may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. For further discussion, see the Fixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Derivatives section in Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n69\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nEvaluation of Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and ACL on Mortgage Loans\nEach quarter, a committee of investment and accounting professionals evaluates investments to determine if a credit loss is present for fixed maturities, AFS or an ACL is required for mortgage loans. This evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative \nprocess, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. For further discussion of the accounting policies, see the Significant Investment Accounting Policies Section in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of credit losses recorded, see the Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments and ACL on Mortgage Loans sections within the Investment Portfolio Risks section of the MD&A.\n|\nCONTINGENCIES RELATING TO CORPORATE LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS \nManagement evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.\nThe Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the Company. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.\n70\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Written premium grew in nearly all lines of business, including package business, excess and surplus and automobile.\n•\nMiddle & large business written premium increased driven by double-digit new business growth, renewal written price increases in all lines and higher insured exposures. Written premium grew in nearly all lines across industry verticals, specialty markets, general industries and large property.\n•\nGlobal specialty written premium increased driven by written price increases across almost all lines as well as an increase in gross new business, primarily in U.S. and international casualty insurance lines. Written premiums also grew in global reinsurance, primarily in property and liability.\nRenewal written price\n increases were recognized in most lines other than directors and officers (\"D&O\").\n•\nIn small business, renewal written price increases were higher in 2024, with accelerating double-digit price increases in package business and automobile and moderating double-digit price increases in excess and surplus lines. Workers' compensation pricing was slightly positive and consistent with 2023.\n•\nIn middle market, renewal written price increases were generally flat to 2023, with high single-digit to low double-digit price increases in most lines other than workers’ compensation, which was slightly positive. Property pricing has moderated from elevated levels in 2023 while automobile pricing has accelerated.\n•\nIn global specialty, U.S. price increases were higher than prior year levels and we achieved mid single-digit renewal written price increases overall, with high single to low double-digit increases in marine, casualty and auto lines. D&O pricing continues to be negative, but to a lesser extent than the prior year.\n74\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Also included is a benefit of $145 related to amortization of the Navigators ADC deferred gain. For additional information regarding the ADC reinsurance agreement, refer to Note 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior accident year development was net favorable for 2023 and included reserve decreases for workers' compensation, catastrophes, bond and package business, partially offset by reserve increases for general liability, assumed reinsurance and automobile liability.\n2025 Outlook\nIn 2025, the Company expects written premium growth to arise from new business, including from expanding addressable markets and distribution, and increases in written pricing in nearly all lines of business. While we anticipate slight, pricing-related headwinds in workers’ compensation margins in 2025, we expect to generate earned pricing in excess of loss trends in the remainder of Business Insurance.\n75\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnderlying Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio\nYear ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023\nUnderlying loss and LAE ratio\n decreased in both automobile and homeowners in 2024. The decrease in automobile was primarily due to the impact of earned pricing increases as well as lower physical damage claim frequency, partially offset by higher automobile claim severities. The auto physical damage claim severity trend has moderated from the prior year. The automobile liability severity increases continue to recognize the inflationary effects and higher attorney representation rates on bodily injury claims. For homeowners, the decrease in the underlying loss and LAE ratio was primarily due to the impact of earned pricing increases and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher claim severities. Contributing to the higher homeowners severity was the effect of higher rebuilding costs.\nCurrent Accident Year Catastrophes and Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Accident Year Development\nYear ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023\nCurrent accident year catastrophe losses\n increased in 2024 compared to the prior year. Current accident year catastrophe losses for 2024 included losses from tornado, wind and hail events in several regions of the United States, and to a lesser extent, from hurricanes and tropical storms primarily in the Southeast region. Current accident year catastrophe losses for 2023 included tornado, wind and hail events across several regions of the United States, losses from winter storms primarily on the East and West coasts, and to a lesser extent, wildfire events and hurricanes and tropical storms.\nPrior accident year development\n was favorable in 2024, primarily driven by lower estimated severity on automobile physical damage, automobile liability, and homeowners, as well as decreases in reserves related to catastrophes. Prior accident year development was unfavorable for 2023, primarily driven by automobile physical damage, partially offset by decreases in reserves related to homeowners and catastrophes.\n2025 Outlook\nIn 2025, the Company expects written premium growth primarily from strong renewal written pricing increases in both automobile and homeowners, as well an increase in new business premium. We expect 2025 annual written pricing increases in both automobile and homeowners to moderate compared to 2024 results. Retention is expected to improve as written pricing moderates, while growth in new business will be driven by increased marketing spend. Loss ratios are expected to continue to improve in automobile.\n80\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Unfavorable prior accident year reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a \n$194\n increase in A&E reserves and a \n$23\n increase in related \nULAE\n reserves. In 2024, an increase in the deferred gain of $62 was recognized relating to ceding losses to the A&E ADC.\nAsbestos reserves\n \nprior accident year development in 2024 before NICO reinsurance of $167 was primarily due to  higher-than-expected frequency, higher settlement values for certain accounts, an increase in the Company’s share of liability due to insolvencies and cost sharing agreements and an increase in claim settlement rates.\nEnvironmental reserves\n \nprior accident year development in 2024 before NICO reinsurance of $36 was primarily due to higher severity on recently emerged accounts, higher environmental site cleanup and monitoring costs, and higher legal expenses.\n81\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet Income \n \nYear ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023\nNet income \nincreased primarily due to a lower group life loss ratio, higher fully insured ongoing premiums and lower realized losses, partially offset by a higher expense ratio and a higher loss ratio on group disability and supplemental health products. \nInsurance operating costs and other expenses \nwere higher prim\narily due to the effect of an increase in fully insured ongoing premium, higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, higher commissions and increased technology investments.\nFully Insured Ongoing Premiums\n \nYear ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 \nFully insured ongoing premiums\n increased over prior year and included an increase in exposure on existing accounts, new business sales, and persistency in excess of 90%, though slightly below the prior year.\nFully insured ongoing sales \ndecreased compared to prior year driven by lower group life and group disability sales.\nRatios\nYear ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 \nLoss ratio\n improved 1.0 points in \n2024 \ncompared to the prior year period, driven by a lower group life loss ratio, partially offset by increased loss ratios in disability and supplemental health products. The group life loss ratio decreased 4.8 points driven by a lower level of mortality. The group disability loss ratio increased 0.9 points driven by higher loss ratio on paid family and medical leave products, partially offset by favorable long-term disability claim recoveries and changes in the long-term disability recovery rate assumption of 0.5 points. \nExpense ratio\n increased primarily due to the impact of higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefits costs and increased investments in technology.\n2025 Outlook\nThe Company expects growth in fully insured ongoing premiums in 2025 due to sales and continued strong book persistency.  The level of long-term disability incidence and recoveries will impact the group disability loss ratio. Although the group life loss ratio, which had been elevated during the pandemic, improved in 2024, we expect 2025 mortality to still be above pre-pandemic levels. We expect the long-term net income margin outlook for this business to be approximately 6% to 7%.\n83\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in our Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of the Company’s risks.\nThe Company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. At the senior management level, an Enterprise Risk and Capital Committee (\"ERCC\") oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the Company. As illustrated below, a number of functional committees sit underneath the ERCC, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ERCC. \nERCC Members\nCEO (Chair)\nChief Financial Officer\nChief Investment Officer\nChief Risk Officer\nChief Underwriting Officer\nGeneral Counsel\nOthers as deemed necessary by the Committee Chair\nERCC\nAsset Liability Committee\nUnderwriting Risk Committee\nEmerging Risk Steering Committee\nOperational Risk Committee\nEconomic Capital Executive Committee\nModel Oversight Committee\nExecutive Artificial Intelligence Governance Council\nThe Company's enterprise risk management (\"ERM\") function supports the ERCC and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things:\n•\nrisk identification and assessment;\n•\nthe development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits;\n•\nrisk monitoring; and\n•\ninternal and external risk reporting.\nThe Company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk, each of which is described in more detail below.\n|\nINSURANCE RISK\nInsurance risk is the risk of losses of both a catastrophic and non-catastrophic nature on the P&C and Employee Benefits products the Company has sold. Catastrophe insurance risk is the exposure arising from both natural catastrophes (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, pandemics) and man-made catastrophes (e.g., terrorism, cyber-attacks) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios.\nSources of Insurance Risk\n Non-catastrophe insurance risks exist within each of the Company's segments except Hartford Funds and include:\n•\nProperty-\n Risk of loss to personal or commercial property from automobile related accidents, weather, explosions, smoke, shaking, fire, theft, vandalism, inadequate installation, faulty equipment, collisions and falling objects, and/or machinery mechanical breakdown resulting in physical damage, losses from PV&T and other covered perils.\n•\nLiability-\n Risk of loss from automobile related accidents, uninsured and under-insured drivers, lawsuits from accidents, defective products, breach of warranty, negligent acts by professional practitioners, environmental claims, latent exposures, fraud, coercion, forgery, failure to fulfill obligations per contract surety, liability from errors and omissions, losses from credit and political risk insurance (\"CPRI\") coverages, losses from derivative lawsuits, and other securities actions and covered perils.\n•\nMortality-\n Risk of loss from unexpected trends in insured deaths impacting timing of payouts from group life insurance, personal or commercial automobile related accidents, and death of employees or executives during the course of employment, while on disability, or while collecting workers compensation benefits.\n•\nMorbidity-\n Risk of loss to an insured from illness incurred during the course of employment or illness from other covered perils.\n•\nDisability-\n Risk of loss incurred from personal or commercial automobile related losses, accidents arising outside of the workplace, injuries or accidents incurred during the course of employment, or from equipment, with \n87\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\neach loss resulting in short-term or long-term disability payments.\n•\nLongevity-\n Risk of loss from increased life expectancy trends among policyholders receiving long-term benefit payments.\n•\nCyber Insurance\n- Risk of loss to property, breach of data and business interruption from various types of cyber-attacks. \nCatastrophe risk primarily arises in the property, automobile, workers' compensation, casualty, group life, and group disability lines of business but could also arise from other coverages such as losses under PV&T and CPRI policies. See the term Current Accident Year Catastrophe Ratio within the Key Performance Measures section of MD&A for an explanation of how the Company defines catastrophe losses in its financial reporting.\nImpact\n Non-catastrophe insurance risk can arise from unexpected loss experience, underpriced business and/or underestimation of loss reserves and can have significant effects on the Company’s earnings. Catastrophe insurance risk can arise from various unpredictable events and can have significant effects on the Company's earnings and may result in losses that could constrain its liquidity.\nManagement\n The Company's policies and procedures for managing these risks include disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk-based pricing, risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies. The Company has established underwriting guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and risks in the aggregate, including aggregate exposure limits by geographic \nzone and peril. The Company uses both internal and third-party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the Company's financial position and results of operations across its businesses. \nThe Hartford closely monitors scientific literature on climate change to help identify climate change risks impacting our business. We use data from the scientific community and other outside experts including partnerships with third-party catastrophe modeling firms to inform our risk management activities and stay abreast of potential implications of climate-related impacts that we incorporate into our risk assessment. We regularly study these climate change implications and incorporate these risks into our catastrophe risk assessment and management strategy through product pricing, underwriting and management of aggregate risk to manage implications of severe weather and climate change in our insurance portfolio. \nIn addition, certain insurance products offered by The Hartford provide coverage for losses incurred due to cyber events and the Company has assessed and modeled how those products would respond to different events in order to manage its aggregate exposure to losses incurred under the insurance policies we sell. The Company models numerous deterministic scenarios including losses caused by malware, data breach, distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions of cloud environments and attacks of power grids. \nAmong specific risk tolerances set by the Company, risk limits are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism risk and pandemic risk.\n88\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRisk\nDefinition\nDetails and Company Limits\nNatural catastrophe\nExposure arising from natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, etc.) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios and the inherent volatility of weather or climate pattern changes. \nThe Company generally limits its estimated before tax loss as a result of natural catastrophes for property & casualty exposures from a single 250-year event to less than 30% of the reported capital and surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries prior to reinsurance and to less than 15% of the reported capital and surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries after reinsurance. The Company generally limits its estimated before tax loss from an aggregation of multiple natural catastrophe events for an all-peril annual aggregate 100-year event to less than 18% reported capital and surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries after reinsurance. From time to time the estimated loss from natural catastrophes may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures or statutory surplus. [1]\nThe table below represents the estimated before tax catastrophe loss exceedance probabilities, from an aggregate of all catastrophe events occurring in a one-year timeframe before and after reinsurance and from a single hurricane or earthquake occurrence.\nModeled Loss Gross and Net of Reinsurance [2]\nProbability of Loss Exceedance [3]\nGross of Reinsurance\nNet of Reinsurance\nAggregate annual all-peril (1-in-100) (1.0%)\n$\n2,837 \n$\n1,629 \nAggregate annual all-peril (1-in-250) (0.4%)\n$\n3,826 \n$\n2,279 \nHurricane single occurrence (1-in-100) (1.0%)\n$\n1,577 \n$\n628 \nHurricane single occurrence (1-in-250) (0.4%)\n$\n2,447 \n$\n1,224 \nEarthquake single occurrence (1-in-100) (1.0%)\n$\n988 \n$\n503 \nEarthquake single occurrence (1-in-250) (0.4%)\n$\n1,652 \n$\n720 \nTerrorism\nThe risk of losses from terrorist attacks, including losses caused by single-site and multi-site conventional attacks, as well as the potential for attacks using nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons (“NBCR”). \nEnterprise limits for terrorism apply to aggregations of risk across property & casualty, employee benefits and specific asset portfolios and are defined based on a deterministic, single-site conventional terrorism attack scenario. The Company manages its potential estimated loss from a conventional terrorism loss scenario, up to $2.0 billion net of reinsurance and $2.5 billion gross of reinsurance, before coverage under TRIPRA. In addition, the Company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss modeling tools as part of its risk management discipline. Our modeled exposures to conventional terrorist attacks around landmark locations may fluctuate above and below our stated limits.\nPandemic\nThe exposure to loss arising from widespread influenza or other pathogens or bacterial infections that create an aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios. \nThe Company generally limits its estimated before tax loss from a single 250 year pandemic event to less than 18% of the aggregate reported capital and surplus of the property and casualty and employee benefits insurance subsidiaries. In evaluating these scenarios, the Company assesses the impact on group life, short-term disability, long-term disability and property & casualty claims. While ERM has a process to track and manage these limits, from time to time, the estimated loss for pandemics may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures, or statutory surplus. In addition, the Company assesses losses in the investment portfolio associated with market declines in the event of a widespread pandemic. [1]\n[1]\nFor U.S. insurance subsidiaries, reported capital and surplus is equal to actual U.S. statutory capital and surplus. For Navigators Insurers in non-U.S. jurisdictions, reported capital and surplus is equal to U.S. GAAP equity of those subsidiaries less certain assets such as goodwill and other intangible assets.\n[2]\nThe loss estimates represent total property modeled losses for hurricane single occurrence events, property and workers' compensation modeled losses for earthquake single occurrence events, and modeled aggregate annual losses for natural catastrophes from all perils (hurricane, flood, earthquake, hail, tornado, wildfire and winter storms). The net loss estimates provided assume that the Company is able to recover all losses ceded to reinsurers under its reinsurance programs. The Company also manages natural catastrophe risk for group life and group disability, which in combination with property and workers compensation loss estimates are subject to separate enterprise risk management net aggregate loss limits as a percent of enterprise surplus.\n[3]\nThe modeled probability of loss exceedance represents the likelihood of a loss from single peril occurrence or from an aggregate of catastrophe events from all perils to exceed the indicated amount in a one-year time frame.\nReinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy\nThe Company uses reinsurance to transfer certain risks to reinsurance companies based on specific geographic or risk concentrations. A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company's risk management strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that reinsure property and workers' compensation exposures, and individual risk (including facultative reinsurance) or quota share arrangements, that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. The Company has no significant finite risk contracts in place and the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year \ncontracts is immaterial. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (\"TRIPRA\") and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.\nReinsurance for Catastrophes\n-\n \nThe Company utilizes various reinsurance programs to mitigate catastrophe losses including excess of loss occurrence-based treaties covering property and workers’ compensation, a catastrophe bond, an aggregate property catastrophe treaty, and individual risk agreements \n89\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(including facultative reinsurance) that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. The aggregate property catastrophe treaty covers the aggregate losses of catastrophe events (up to $350 per event) designated by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk and, for international business, net losses arising from two or more risks involved in the same loss occurrence totaling at least $500 thousand, in excess of a $750 retention. The occurrence-based property catastrophe treaty responds in excess of $200 per occurrence for all perils other than earthquakes and named hurricanes and tropical storms.\nFor earthquakes and named tropical storms the occurrence based property treaty responds in excess of $350 per occurrence. The occurrence property catastrophe treaty and workers’ compensation catastrophe treaties beginning with the January 1, 2021 renewal do not cover pandemic losses, as most industry reinsurance programs exclude communicable disease. The Company has reinsurance in place to cover individual group life losses in excess of $1 per person.\nPrimary Catastrophe Reinsurance Coverages as of January 1, 2025 [1]\nPortion of losses reinsured\nPortion of losses retained by The Hartford\nPer Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty from 1/1/2025 to 12/31/2025 [1] [2]\nLosses of $0 to $200\nNone\n100% retained\nLosses of $200 to $350 for earthquakes and named hurricanes and tropical storms [3]\nNone\n100% retained\nLosses of $200 to $350 from one event other than earthquakes and named hurricanes and tropical storms [3]\n40% of $150 in excess of $200\n60% co-participation\nLosses of $350 to $500 from one event (all perils)\n75% of $150 in excess of $350\n25% co-participation\nLosses of $500 to $1.20 billion from one event [4] (all perils)\n90% of $700 in excess of $500\n10% co-participation\nPer Occurrence Property Catastrophe Bond from 1/1/2025 to 12/31/2026 [5]\nLosses of $1.19 billion to $1.49 billion for tropical cyclone and earthquake events [6]\n66.67% of $300 in excess of $1.19 billion\n33.33% of $300 in excess of $1.19 billion\nAggregate Property Catastrophe Treaty for 1/1/2025 to 12/31/2025 [7]\n$0 to $750 of aggregate losses\nNone\n100% Retained\n$750 to $950 of aggregate losses\n100%\nNone\nWorkers' Compensation Catastrophe Treaty for 1/1/2025 to 12/31/2025\nLosses of $0 to $100 from one event\nNone\n100% Retained\nLosses of $100 to $450 from one event [8]\n80% of $350 in excess of $100\n20% co-participation\n[1]\nThese agreements do not cover the assumed reinsurance business which purchases its own retrocessional coverage.\n[2]\nIn addition to the Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty, for Florida homeowners wind events, The Hartford has purchased the mandatory FHCF reinsurance for the annual period starting June 1, 2024. Retention and coverage varies by writing company. The writing company with the largest coverage under FHCF is Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest, with coverage of $35 in per event losses in excess of a $19 retention (estimates are based on best available information at this time and are periodically updated as information is made available by Florida).\n[3]\nNamed hurricanes and tropical storms are defined as any storm or storm system declared to be a hurricane or tropical storm by the US National Hurricane Center, US Weather Prediction Center, or their successor organizations (being divisions of the US National Weather Service).  \n[4]\nPortions of this layer of coverage extend beyond a traditional one year term.\n[5]\nRefer to \"Catastrophe Bond\" discussion below for further information. \n[6]\nTropical cyclones are defined as a storm or storm system that has been declared by National Weather Service or any division or agency thereof (including the National Hurricane Center or the Weather Prediction Center) or any of their successors to be a hurricane, tropical storm, or tropical depression.\n[7]\nThe aggregate treaty is not limited to a single event; rather, it is designed to provide reinsurance protection for the aggregate of all catastrophe events (up to $350 per event), either designated by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk or, for international business, net losses arising from two or more risks involved in the same loss occurrence totaling at least $500 thousand. All catastrophe losses, except assumed reinsurance business losses, apply toward satisfying the $750 attachment point under the aggregate treaty.\n[8]\nIn addition to the limits shown, the workers' compensation reinsurance includes a non-catastrophe, industrial accident layer, providing coverage for 80% of $25 in per event losses in excess of a $25 retention.\nIn addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the Company has other reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses, some of which provide for reinstatement of limits in the event of loss with reinstatement provisions varying depending on the layer of coverage. The Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty and Workers' Compensation Catastrophe Treaty include a provision to reinstate one limit in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties. \nCatastrophe Bond\n- The Company has property catastrophe protection in the form of catastrophe bonds issued through an indemnity agreement with Foundation Re IV Ltd. (“Foundation Re IV”), an independent Bermuda company registered as a special purpose insurer under the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 and related rules and regulations. The agreement provides fully collateralized loss coverage on the Company’s commercial and personal property and automobile physical damage in all 50 states of the United States of America, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico from tropical cyclone and earthquake events.\n90\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe reinsurance agreement with Foundation Re IV, which originally incepted January 1, 2024, provides indemnity per occurrence excess of loss coverage of 66.67% of $300 in losses in excess of $1.19 billion for the treaty term effective January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2026. The attachment point and maximum limit under this agreement are reset annually to adjust the expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. The Company has not incurred any losses that have resulted or are expected to result in a recovery under the reinsurance agreement with Foundation Re IV since its inception.\nUnder the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the Company is obligated to pay annual reinsurance premiums to Foundation Re IV for the reinsurance coverage. Amounts payable to the Company under the reinsurance agreement with respect to any covered event cannot exceed the Company's actual losses from such event. The principal amount of the catastrophe bonds will be reduced by any amounts paid to the Company under the reinsurance agreement.\nThe reinsurance agreement meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the guidance for reinsurance contracts. In connection with the reinsurance agreement, Foundation Re IV issued $200 in notes (generally referred to as “catastrophe bonds”) to investors in amounts equal to the full coverage provided under the reinsurance agreement. The proceeds of the issuance were deposited in a reinsurance trust account.\nAs with any reinsurance agreement, there is credit risk associated with collecting amounts due from reinsurers. Foundation Re IV’s credit risk is mitigated by a reinsurance trust account that has been funded by Foundation Re IV with money market funds that invest solely in direct government obligations and obligations backed by the U.S. government. The money market funds must have the highest principal stability ratings from S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) on the issuance date of the bonds and thereafter must be rated by S&P or Moody’s, as applicable. Other permissible investments include money market funds which invest in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by direct government obligations and obligations of any agency backed by the U.S. government with terms of no more than 397 calendar days, and cash.\nAt the time the agreement was entered into with Foundation Re IV, the Company evaluated the applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and concluded that it was a VIE. However, while Foundation Re IV was determined to be a VIE, the Company concluded that it did not have a variable interest in the entity, as the variability in its results, caused by the reinsurance agreement, is expected to be absorbed entirely by the investors in the catastrophe bonds issued by Foundation Re IV and residual amounts earned by it, if any, are expected to be absorbed by the equity investor (the Company has neither an equity nor a residual interest in Foundation Re IV).\nAccordingly, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of Foundation Re IV and does not consolidate that entity in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Additionally, because the Company has no intention to pursue any transaction that would result in it acquiring interest in and becoming the primary beneficiary of Foundation Re IV, the \nconsolidation of that entity in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods is unlikely.\nReinsurance for Terrorism\n-\n For the risk of terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is generally limited and largely unavailable for terrorism losses caused by nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As such, the Company's principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA to the end of 2027.\nTRIPRA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of terrorism”, which is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, for losses that exceed a threshold of industry losses of $200. Under the program, in any one calendar year, the federal government will pay a percentage of losses incurred from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer's losses exceed 20% of the Company's eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. The percentage of losses paid by the federal government is 80% . The Company's estimated deductible under the program is $2.2 billion for 2025. If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, Congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.\nReinsurance for A&E and Navigators Group Reserve Development\n -\n The Company has two ADC reinsurance agreements in place, both of which are accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. One agreement covered substantially all A&E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years (the “A&E ADC”) up to an aggregate limit of $1.5 billion and the other covered substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance Company (\"NIC\") and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years (the “Navigators ADC”) up to an aggregate limit of $300. As the Company has ceded all of the $300 and $1.5 billion available limits under the Navigators ADC and the A&E ADC; respectively, there is no remaining limit available under either agreement as of December 31, 2024. During 2024, the Company collected recoveries from NICO under the Navigators ADC and as a result amortized $145 of the $209 deferred gain within benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the deferred gain on the Navigators ADC was $64 and $209, respectively, and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information on the A&E ADC and the Navigators ADC, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 10, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nProperty and Casualty insurance product reinsurance recoverables represent loss and loss adjustment expense recoverables from a number of entities, including reinsurers and pools. A portion of the total gross reinsurance recoverables balance relates to the Company’s participation in various mandatory (assigned) and involuntary risk pools and the value of annuity contracts held under structured settlement agreements.\n91\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nEmployee Benefits and Corporate reinsurance recoverables represent reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other policyholder funds and benefits payable that are recoverable from a number of reinsurers. \nThe table below shows the gross and net reinsurance recoverables reported in the Property and Casualty and Employee Benefits reportable segments as well as Corporate. \nTo manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer.\nIn placing reinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral or other credit enhancement, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and \ncedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. For further discussion on reinsurance recoverables, including details of recoverables by AM Best credit rating, see Note 8 – Reinsurance of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAnnually, the Company completes evaluations of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Property & Casualty Other Operations reportable segment and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reported in the Business Insurance and Employee Benefits reportable segments as well as the Corporate category. For a discussion regarding the results of the evaluation of older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Property & Casualty Other Operations reportable segment, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.

ERM is responsible for establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the Company's operational risk management program. Operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:\n•\nEstablishing policies and monitoring risk tolerances and exceptions;\n•\nConducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;\n•\nValidating existing crisis management protocols;\n•\nIdentifying and monitoring emerging risks; and\n•\nPurchasing insurance coverage.\nCybersecurity Risk\nFor information on the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, see Part I, Item 1C – Cybersecurity.  \n92\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n|\nFINANCIAL RISK\nFinancial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives from events that impact financial market conditions and the value of financial assets. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's invested assets. \nConsistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored and managed, with risks mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including limiting aggregation of risk, portfolio re-balancing and hedging with OTC and exchange-traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives may be used to achieve the following Company-approved objectives: (1) hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; (2) managing liquidity; (3) controlling transaction costs; and (4) engaging in income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management. The Company identifies different categories of financial risk, including liquidity, credit, interest rate, equity, and foreign currency exchange.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations as they come due.\nSources of Liquidity Risk \nSources of liquidity risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value of the investment portfolio.\nImpact\n \nInadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.\nManagement\n The Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. The Company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquid assets among legal entities. The Company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact operating cash flows or liquid assets. The liquidity requirements of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. (\"HIG Holding Company\") have been and will continue to be met by the HIG Holding Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from \nits subsidiaries, principally from its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities as needed. The Company maintains multiple sources of contingent liquidity including a revolving credit facility, an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HIG Holding Company and certain affiliates, and access to collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (\"FHLBB\") for certain affiliates. The Company's CFO has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.\nCredit Risk and Counterparty Risk\nCredit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. Credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spreads.\nSources of Credit Risk \nThe majority of the Company’s credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings and use of derivatives, but it is also present in the Company’s ceded reinsurance activities, bond insurance, and certain aspects of Business Insurance products.\nImpact\n A decline in creditworthiness is typically reflected as an increase in an investment’s credit spread and an associated decline in the investment's fair value, potentially resulting in recording an ACL and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. In certain instances, counterparties may default on their obligations and the Company may realize a loss on default. Premiums receivable, including premiums for retrospectively rated plans, reinsurance recoverable and deductible losses recoverable are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty’s inability to pay.\nManagement\n The objective of the Company’s enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk in aggregate and to limit potential losses in accordance with the Company's credit risk management policy. The Company manages its credit risk by managing aggregations of risk, holding a diversified mix of issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios, and limiting exposure to any specific reinsurer or counterparty. Potential credit losses can be mitigated through diversification (e.g., geographic regions, asset types, industry sectors), hedging and the use of collateral to reduce net credit exposure.\nThe Company manages credit risk through the use of various surveillance, analyses and governance processes. The investment and reinsurance areas have formal policies and procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish criteria defining minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability for eligible counterparties. Potential investments are subject to underwriting reviews and management approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:\n•\nInvesting in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities; \n•\nSelling investments subject to heightened credit risk;\n•\nHedging through use of credit default swaps;\n93\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n•\nClearing derivative transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin;\n•\nEntering into derivative and reinsurance contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions;\n•\nRequiring collateral; and\n•\nNon-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.\nThe Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure are monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent of the counterparty across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivatives. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer or counterparty greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAssets and Liabilities Subject to Credit Risk\nInvestments\n \nEssentially all of the Company's invested assets are subject to credit risk. In 2024, there were net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS of $2 and a net credit loss reversal on mortgage loans of $3. In 2023, there were net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and an increase in the ACL on mortgage loans of $14 and $15, respectively. Refer to the Investment Portfolio Risk section of Financial Risk Management under “Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments\" and \"ACL on Mortgage Loans”.\nReinsurance recoverables\n Reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, were $7,140 and $7,104 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. Refer to the Enterprise Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy”.\nBond insurance\n The Company collects premiums and holds reserves for risk exposures within the bond insurance business where the Company guarantees the completion of our insured's financial or performance obligations in the event of a default on their contractual obligations. The Company manages this risk through underwriting risk assessment, collateral requirements for insureds, claims management, and reinsurance.\nPremiums receivable and agents' balances\n Premiums receivable and agents’ balances, net of an ACL, were $5,998 and $5,607, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For a discussion regarding collectibility of these balances, see Note 7 - Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk of Derivatives\nThe Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.\nDowngrades to the credit ratings of the Company’s insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for OTC derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require additional collateralization before entering into any new trades.\nManaging the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments\nThe Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company’s policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the \n94\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ncounterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management.\nThe Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. \nThe Company’s credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s net fair value, including income accruals, of all derivative positions transacted with a single counterparty for each separate legal entity. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not necessarily reflective of credit risk. The Company enters into collateral arrangements in connection with its derivatives positions and collateral is pledged to or held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the exposure is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds, if applicable. In accordance with industry standards and the contractual requirements, collateral is typically settled on the same business day. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments section of Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Credit Derivatives\nThe Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield.\nCredit Risk Reduced Through Credit Derivatives\nThe Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity or referenced index. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company did not hold credit derivatives that purchase credit protection. \nCredit Risk Assumed Through Credit Derivatives\nThe Company may also enter into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not hold credit default swaps that assume credit risk.\nFor further information on credit derivatives, see Note 6 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk of Business Operations\nA portion of the Company's Business Insurance business is written with large deductibles or under retrospectively-rated plans. Under some commercial insurance contracts with a large deductible, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim and the Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. As such, the Company is subject to credit risk until reimbursement \nis made. Retrospectively-rated policies are utilized primarily for workers' compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is adjusted based on actual losses incurred. Although the premium adjustment feature of a retrospectively-rated policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it presents credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such policyholders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the amount of additional premium owed under retrospectively-rated policies. The Company manages these credit risks through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and oversight. For more information, see Note 7- Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.\nSources of Interest Rate Risk \nThe Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from investments in fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans, issuances by the Company of debt securities, preferred stock and similar securities, discount rate assumptions associated with the Company’s claim reserves and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, and assets that support the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nImpact\n Changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the Company.\nChange in Interest Rates\nFavorable Effects\nUnfavorable Effects\nÝ\n•\nAdditional net investment income due to reinvesting at higher yields and higher yields on variable rate securities\n•\nDecrease in the fair value of the fixed income investment portfolio\nÞ\n•\nIncrease in the fair value of the fixed income investment portfolio\n•\nLower net investment income due to reinvesting at lower yields and lower yields on variable rate securities\n•\nAcceleration in paydowns and prepayments or calls of certain mortgage-backed and municipal securities\nManagement\n The Company primarily manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that seek to protect the Company from the economic impact associated with changes in interest rates by setting portfolio duration targets that are aligned with the duration of the \n95\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nliabilities that they support. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flow simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and the associated liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration. \nThe Company may also use interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, futures to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or liabilities and to manage portfolio duration. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $4.6 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, and primarily relate to hedging invested assets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of these derivatives was $0 and $(6), respectively. \nAssets and Liabilities Subject to Interest Rate Risk\nFixed income investments\n The fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $53.3 billion and $50.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 3.8 for both periods. Changes in the fair value of fixed maturities due to changes in interest rates are reflected as a component of AOCI.\nLong-term debt obligations\n The Company's variable rate debt obligations will generally result in increased interest expense as a result of higher interest rates; the inverse is true during a declining interest rate environment. However, as explained in Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has entered into an interest-rate swap agreement to effectively convert variable interest rate payments on its $500 junior subordinated debentures due 2067 to fixed interest payments. Changes in the value of fixed rate long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of these instruments but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGroup life and disability product liabilities\n The cash outflows associated with contracts issued by the Company's Employee Benefits segment, primarily group life and short and long-term disability policy liabilities, are not interest rate sensitive but vary based on timing. Though the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable, these products rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $8,496 and $8,586, respectively of reserves for group life and disability contracts. For most Employee Benefits liabilities, changes in interest rates will impact the fair value but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. For long-duration insurance contracts, including paid-up life and life conversions, changes in interest rates will impact both the fair value and the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPension and other postretirement benefit obligations\n The Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are exposed to interest rate risk based upon the sensitivity of present value obligations to changes in liability discount rates as well as the sensitivity of the fair value of investments in the plan portfolios to changes in interest rates. The discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve that reflects high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. The Company is exposed to the risk of having to make additional plan contributions if the plans’ investment returns, including from investments in fixed maturities, are lower than expected. For further discussion of discounting pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, refer to Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nGroup Life and Disability Reserves and Invested Assets Supporting Them\nIncluded in the following table is the before tax change in the net economic value of contracts issued by the Company’s Employee Benefits segment, primarily group life and disability, for which fixed valuation discount rate assumptions are established based upon investment returns assumed in pricing, along with the corresponding invested assets. For long-duration insurance contracts the discount rate is updated quarterly with an equivalent single rate that is based on a current market observable, upper-medium grade fixed maturity yield. This has been interpreted to represent a yield based on single-A credit \n96\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nrated fixed maturity instruments with similar duration to the related liability. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of other insurance products such as automobile, property, workers' compensation and general liability insurance. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. The calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.\nThe selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. The Company’s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity of Employee Benefits Reserves and Invested Assets Supporting Them\nChange in Net Economic Value as of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nBasis point shift\n-100 \n+100\n-100\n+100\nIncrease (decrease) in economic value, before tax \n$\n69 \n$\n(57)\n$\n64 \n$\n(50)\nThe carrying value of assets related to supporting Employee Benefits, primarily long-term disability reserves, was $10.0 billion and $10.3 billion, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and included fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments. The assets are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually, using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nInvested Assets not Supporting Group Life and Disability Reserves \nThe following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before tax change in the fair value of the Company’s investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting group life and disability reserves which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity of Invested Assets (Excluding Those Supporting Employee Benefits Reserves)\nChange in Fair Value as of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nBasis point shift\n-100 \n+100 \n-100\n+100\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value, before tax \n$\n1,758 \n$\n(1,627)\n$\n1,590 \n$\n(1,466)\nThe carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments, excluding those related to supporting Employee Benefits short and long-term disability reserves, was $43.3 billion and $39.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLong-term Debt\nA 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would result in an increase in the fair value of long-term debt by $397 and $444 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term debt by $336 and $373 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the value of long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will not impact the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nPension and Other Postretirement Plan Obligations\nA 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would impact both the value of the underlying pension assets and the value of the liabilities, resulting in an increase in the unfunded liabilities (or decrease in asset) for pension and other postretirement plan obligations of $9 and $12 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would have the inverse effect and result in a decrease in the unfunded liabilities (or increase in assets) for pension and other postretirement plan obligations of $3 and $3 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gains or losses due to changes in the yield curve on the pension and postretirement plan obligations are recorded within AOCI and are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold.\nEquity Risk\nEquity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices. \nSources of Equity Risk \nThe Company has exposure to equity risk from invested assets, assets that support the \n97\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCompany’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and fee income derived from Hartford Funds AUM.\nImpact\n \nThe investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, which could negatively impact the Company's reported earnings. In addition, investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments generally have a level of correlation to domestic equity market levels and can expose the Company to losses in earnings if valuations decline; however, earnings impacts are recognized on a lag as results from private equity investments and other funds are generally reported on a three-month delay. For assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. Hartford Funds earnings are also significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of average daily AUM and the amount of fee income generated from those assets. Increases in equity markets will generally have the inverse impact. \nManagement\n The Company uses various approaches in managing its equity exposure, including limits on the proportion of assets invested in equities, diversification of the equity portfolio, and, at times, hedging of changes in equity indices. For assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments and impose concentration limits and investment quality requirements on permissible investment options.\nAssets and Liabilities Subject to Equity Risk \nInvestment portfolio\n The investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, as well as limited partnerships and other alternative investments. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of these types of investments and could negatively impact the Company’s earnings while increases in equity will have the inverse impact. For equity securities, the changes in fair value are reported in net realized gains and losses. For limited partnerships and other alternative investments, the Company's share of earnings for the period is recorded in net investment income, though typically on a delay based on the availability of the underlying financial statements. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.\nAssets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans\n The Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below. \nDeclines in value are recognized as unrealized losses in AOCI. Increases in equity markets are recognized as unrealized gains in AOCI. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold. For further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAssets under management\n AUM in Hartford Funds may decrease in value during equity market declines, which would result in lower earnings because fee income is earned based upon the value of AUM.\nEquity Sensitivity\nInvestment portfolio and the assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans\nIncluded in the following tables are the estimated before tax change in the economic value of the Company’s invested assets and assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans with sensitivity to equity risk. The calculation of the hypothetical change in economic value below assumes a 20% upward and downward shock to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Price Index (\"S&P 500\"). For limited partnerships and other alternative investments, the movement in economic value is calculated using a beta analysis largely derived from historical experience relative to the S&P 500.\nThe selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. These calculations do not capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations. \n98\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

If equity markets were to hypothetically decline 20% and remain depressed for one year, the estimated before tax impact on reported Hartford Funds earnings for that one year period is approximately $70 as of December 31, 2024. The selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nForeign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.\nSources of Currency Risk \nThe Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities, and derivative instruments. In addition, the Company has non-U.S. subsidiaries, some with functional currencies other than U.S. dollar, and which transact business in multiple currencies resulting in assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\nImpact \nChanges in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities. The impact on the fair value of fixed maturities, AFS due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, is reported in unrealized gains or losses as part of other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"). The realization of gains or losses resulting from investment sales or from changes in investments that record changes in fair value through the income statement due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is reflected through net realized gains and losses.\nIn regard to insurance and reinsurance contracts that the Company enters into for which we are obligated to pay losses in a foreign currency, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities related to these contracts is reflected through net realized gains and losses. These assets or liabilities include, but are not limited to, cash and cash equivalents, premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables, and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Additionally, the Company translates the assets, liabilities, and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities into U.S. dollars. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income.\nManagement\n \nThe Company manages its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through asset-liability matching and through the use of derivative instruments. However, legal entity capital is invested in local currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations. The foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using foreign currency swaps and forwards.\nAssets and Liabilities Subject to Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\nInvestment portfolio\n The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk affecting non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities, and derivative instruments. Changes in relative values between currencies can positively or negatively impact net realized gains and losses or unrealized gains (losses) as part of other comprehensive income.\nInsurance contract related assets and liabilities \nThe Company has non-U.S. dollar denominated insurance and reinsurance contracts and associated premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, that are exposed to foreign exchange risk. For contracts that are within U.S dollar functional currency legal entities, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can positively or negatively impact net realized gains and losses. For contracts within non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities, changes in the functional currency relative to the U.S. dollar can positively or negatively impact other comprehensive income.\nForeign Currency Sensitivity\nFor the Company’s primary currencies that create foreign exchange risk, the following table provides the estimated impact of a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates.

At times, the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:\n•\nA decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening, an increase in interest rates, or a decline in equity market levels, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios;\n•\nA decline in investment yields may reduce our net investment income, which may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios;\n•\nDecreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios; and\n•\nNon-market factors can also impact the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and RBC ratios.\nMost of these factors are outside of the Company’s control. Among other factors, rating agencies consider the level of statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries as well as the level of GAAP capital held by the Company in determining the Company’s financial strength and credit ratings. Rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.\n100\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

These loans are collateralized by real estate properties that are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These commercial loans are originated by the Company as high quality whole loans, and the Company may sell participation interests in one or more loans to third parties. A loan participation interest represents a pro-rata share in interest and principal payments generated by the participated loan, and the relationship between the Company as loan originator, lead participant and servicer and the third party as a participant are governed by a participation agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2024, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $6.4 billion and carrying value of $6.4 billion, with an ACL of $44. As of December 31, 2023, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $6.1 billion and carrying value of $6.1 billion, with an ACL of $51. The release in the allowance reflects write-\noffs, improved economic scenario forecasts and property specific reductions, partially offset by net additions of new loans.\nThe Company funded $601 million of commercial mortgage loans, primarily industrial properties, with a weighted average loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of 58% and a weighted average yield of 7.1% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. The Company continues to originate commercial mortgage loans on institutional-quality properties with strong LTV ratios.

The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the largest issuer concentrations were the State of Illinois, the State of California, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. As of December 31, 2023, the largest issuer concentrations were the New York City Transitional Finance Authority, the State of Illinois, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. In total, municipal bonds make up 9% of the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments\nThe following table presents the Company’s investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include real estate joint ventures, real estate funds, private equity funds, other funds, and other alternative investments. Private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential and strong owner sponsorship, as well as limited exposure to public markets.\nIncome or losses on investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments are recognized on a lag as results from private equity investments and other funds are generally reported on a three-month delay.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments - Net Investment Income\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nAmount\nYield [1]\nAmount\nYield [1]\nAmount\nYield [1]\nReal estate joint ventures and funds\n$\n(67)\n(3.4)\n%\n$\n(10)\n(0.5)\n%\n$\n316 \n21.9 \n%\nPrivate equity funds\n108 \n5.9 \n%\n161 \n9.9 \n%\n186 \n14.2 \n%\nOther funds\n60 \n11.7 \n%\n29 \n6.6 \n%\n32 \n10.5 \n%\nOther alternative investments [2]\n47 \n9.1 \n%\n32 \n6.6 \n%\n(19)\n(3.8)\n%\nTotal\n$\n148\n \n3.0\n \n%\n$\n212\n \n4.8\n \n%\n$\n515\n \n14.4\n \n%\n[1]\nYields calculated using annualized net investment income divided by the monthly average invested assets.\n[2]\nConsists of an insurer-owned life insurance policy which is primarily invested in private equity funds and fixed income.\n104\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

As of December 31, 2024, $1.7 billion of the gross unrealized losses were associated with fixed maturities, AFS depressed less than 20% of amortized cost. The remaining $0.5 billion of gross unrealized losses were associated with fixed maturities, AFS depressed greater than 20%. The fixed maturities, AFS depressed more than 20% primarily related to corporate fixed maturities, U.S. Treasuries, and municipal bonds, that are mainly depressed because current interest rates are higher than at the respective purchase dates.\nAs part of the Company’s ongoing investment monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these fixed maturities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the investments approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position where an ACL has not been recorded, the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the investment. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these investments.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCredit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nThe Company recorded net credit losses of $2, primarily attributable to increases in the ACL of $1 on CMBS and $1 on a below investment grade corporate issuer. Unrealized losses on securities with an ACL recognized in OCI were less than $1. For further information, refer to Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThere were no intent-to-sell impairments\nThe Company incorporates its best estimate of future performance using internal assumptions and judgments that are informed by economic and industry specific trends, as well as our expectations with respect to security specific developments.\nFuture intent-to-sell impairments or credit losses may develop as the result of changes in our intent to sell specific securities that are in an unrealized loss position or if modeling assumptions, such as macroeconomic factors or security specific developments, change unfavorably from our current modeling assumptions, resulting in lower cash flow expectations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nThe Company recorded net credit losses of $14, primarily attributable to increases in the ACL of $12 related to three below investment grade corporate issuers and $2 related to a CMBS that had an ACL in the prior period driven by prepayments. Unrealized losses on securities with an ACL recognized in other comprehensive income were $4.\nThere were no intent-to-sell impairments.\nACL on Mortgage Loans\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nThe Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to estimate the ACL with changes in the ACL recorded in net realized gains and losses. Apart from an ACL recorded on individual mortgage loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company records an ACL on the pool of mortgage loans based on lifetime expected credit losses. For further information, refer to Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company recorded a credit loss reversal of $3 primarily attributable to improved economic scenario forecasts and property specific improvements, partially offset by net additions of new loans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nThe Company recorded an increase in the ACL on mortgage loans of $15. The increase is primarily attributable to revised economic scenarios, lower property valuations, and overall weaker real estate fundamentals.\n106\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nThe following section discusses the overall financial strength of The Hartford and its insurance operations including their ability to generate cash flows from each of their business segments, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.\n|\nSUMMARY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nCapital available to the holding company as of December 31, 2024:\n•\nApproximately $1.3 billion in fixed maturities, short-term investments, investment sales receivable and cash at the HIG Holding Company;\n•\nA senior unsecured revolving credit facility that provides for borrowing capacity up to $750 of unsecured credit through October 27, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding; and \n•\nAn intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HIG Holding Company and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and  other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, $1.9 billion was available, $105 was outstanding between certain affiliates, and there were no amounts outstanding at the HIG Holding Company.As of February 20, 2025, $1.85 billion was available, $150 was outstanding between certain affiliates and there were no amounts outstanding at the HIG Holding Company.\n2025 expected dividends and other sources of capital:\nThe future payment of dividends from our subsidiaries is dependent on several factors including business results, capital position and liquidity of our subsidiaries.\n•\nP&C - \nThe Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have regulatory dividend capacity of $2.0 billion for 2025. The HIG Holding Company expects to receive approximately $1.7 billion of net dividends in 2025 after considering state deposit and regulatory capital requirements to support growth in certain entities, dividends that are expected to be subsequently contributed to P&C subsidiaries and dividends related to interest on intercompany notes.\n•\nEmployee Benefits -\n Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (\"HLA\") has regulatory dividend capacity of $592 in 2025 with approximately $590 of dividends expected in 2025. \n•\nHartford Funds\n - HIG Holding Company expects to receive approximately $150 in dividends from Hartford Funds in 2025. \nExpected liquidity requirements for the next twelve months as of December 31, 2024:\n•\n$194 of interest on debt, net of settlements on a related interest rate swap. See Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements;\n•\n$21 dividends on preferred stock, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors; and\n•\n$605 of common stockholders' dividends, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and before share repurchases.\nExpected liquidity requirements for beyond the next twelve months as of December 31, 2024:\n•\nInterest on and repayments of debt, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n•\nPreferred stock and common stock dividends, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nEquity repurchase program:\nIn 2024, the Company repurchased 14.4 million common shares for $1.5 billion under two share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. The Company had a $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization which was effective through December 31, 2024. In addition to this authorization, in July 2024, the Board of Directors approved a $3.3 billion share repurchase authorization effective from August 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has $3.15 billion remaining for equity repurchases under the share repurchase program effective through 2026. During the period January 1, 2025 through February 20, 2025, the Company repurchased approximately 2.2 million common shares for $248.\nThe timing of any repurchases is dependent on several factors, including the market price of the Company's securities, the Company's capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Company's financial strength or credit ratings, the Company's blackout periods, and other considerations.\n|\nLIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL\nThe Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. (\"HIG Holding Company\")\nThe liquidity requirements of the HIG Holding Company will primarily be met by HIG Holding Company’s fixed maturities; short-term investments and cash; and dividends \nfrom its subsidiaries, principally its insurance operations\n. The Company \n107\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nmaintains sufficient liquidity and has a variety of contingent liquidity resources to manage liquidity across a range of economic scenarios.\nThe HIG Holding Company expects to continue to receive dividends from its operating subsidiaries in the future and manages capital in its operating subsidiaries to be sufficient under significant economic stress scenarios. Dividends from subsidiaries and other sources of funds at the holding company may be used to repurchase shares under the authorized share repurchase program at the discretion of management.\nUnder significant economic stress scenarios, the Company has the ability to meet short-term cash requirements, if needed, by borrowing under its revolving credit facility or by having its insurance subsidiaries take collateralized advances under a facility with the FHLBB. The Company could also choose to have its insurance subsidiaries sell certain highly liquid, high quality fixed maturities or the Company could issue debt in the public markets under its shelf registration.\n|\nDIVIDENDS\nThe Hartford's Board of Directors declared the following quarterly dividends since October 1, 2024:\nCommon Stock Dividends\nDeclared\nRecord\nPayable\nAmount per share\nOctober 24, 2024\nDecember 2, 2024\nJanuary 3, 2025\n$\n0.520 \nFebruary 19, 2025\nMarch 3, 2025\nApril 2, 2025\n$\n0.520 \nPreferred Stock Dividends\nDeclared\nRecord\nPayable\nAmount per share\nDecember 18, 2024\nFebruary 1, 2025\nFebruary 18, 2025\n$\n375.00 \nFebruary 19, 2025\nMay 1, 2025\nMay 15, 2025\n$\n375.00 \nThere are no current restrictions on HIG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. \nFor a discussion of restrictions on dividends to HIG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries, see the following \"Dividends from Subsidiaries\" discussion. For a discussion of potential restrictions on the HIG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends, see Part I, Item 1A, — Risk Factors for the risk factor \"Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.\"\n|\nDIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES\nDividends to HIG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. The Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nThe payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the preceding year, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. \nProperty casualty insurers domiciled in New York, including NIC and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (\"NSIC\"), generally may not, without notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner, pay dividends out of earned surplus in any twelve‑month period that exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the most recent financial statement on file, or (ii) 100% of its adjusted net investment income, as defined, for the same twelve month period. \nThe insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization, regulatory capital requirements, liquidity requirements and state deposit requirements of the individual subsidiary.\nCorporate members of Lloyd's syndicates may pay dividends to its parent to the extent of available profits that have been distributed from the syndicate in excess of the FAL capital requirement and subject to restrictions imposed under UK Company Law. The FAL is determined based on the syndicate's SCR under the Solvency II capital adequacy model, the current regulatory framework governing UK domiciled insurers, plus a Lloyd’s specific economic capital assessment. \nInsurers domiciled in the United Kingdom may pay dividends to their parent out of their statutory profits subject to restrictions imposed under U.K. Company law and Solvency II.\nIn 2024, HIG Holding Company received $608 of dividends from HLA and $136 from Hartford Funds, and $31 from other non-insurance subsidiaries. In addition, HIG Holding Company received $1.5 billion of net dividends from P&C subsidiaries in 2024 which excludes $75 of P&C dividends that were subsequently contributed to P&C subsidiaries and $50 of P&C dividends related to interest payments on an intercompany note owed by Hartford Holdings, Inc. (\"HHI\") to Hartford Fire Insurance Company. Refer to \"2025 expected dividends and other sources of capital\" for expected payments of dividends from our subsidiaries in 2025.\n108\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n|\nOTHER SOURCES OF CAPITAL FOR THE HIG HOLDING COMPANY\nThe Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace (see the \"Ratings\" section below for further discussion), and stockholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of debt, common equity, preferred stock, equity-related debt or other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic opportunities. The issuance of debt, common equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of stockholder interests or reduced net income to common stockholders due to additional interest expense or preferred stock dividends.\nShelf Registrations\nThe Hartford filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"the SEC\") on September 23, 2024 that permits it to offer and sell debt and equity securities during the three-year life of the registration statement.\nFor further information regarding shelf registrations, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Hartford has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") that provides up to $750 of unsecured credit through October 27, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding and no letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and The Hartford was in compliance with all financial covenants. For further information regarding the Credit Facility, see Note 13 – Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIntercompany Liquidity Agreements\nThe Company has $2.0 billion available under an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HIG Holding Company and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Department of Insurance (\"CTDOI\") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the HIG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $1.9 billion was available, $105 was outstanding between certain affiliates and there were no amounts outstanding at the HIG Holding Company.As of February 20, 2025, $1.85 billion was available, $150 was outstanding between certain affiliates and there were no amounts outstanding at the HIG Holding Company.\nCollateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston\nThe Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and HLA, are members of the FHLBB. Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or \nvariable rates. Advances may be used to support general corporate purposes, which would be presented as short- or long-term debt, or to earn incremental investment income, which would be presented in other liabilities consistent with other collateralized financing transactions. As of December 31, 2024, there were no advances outstanding. The CTDOI permits Hartford Fire and HLA to pledge up to $1.4 billion and $0.6 billion in qualifying assets, respectively, without prior approval, to secure FHLBB advances in 2025. For further information regarding the Company's collateralized advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nLloyd's Letter of Credit Facility\nThe Hartford has a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the \"Lloyd's Facility\"). On October 21, 2024, The Hartford amended and restated its Lloyd's Facility agreement. The amended and restated Lloyd's Facility has two tranches with one tranche extending a $74 commitment and the other tranche extending a £79 million ($99 as of December 31, 2024) commitment. As of December 31, 2024, letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $74 and £79 million, or $99, were outstanding under the Lloyd's Facility.\nAmong other covenants, the Lloyd's Facility contains financial covenants regarding The Hartford's consolidated net worth and financial leverage. As of December 31, 2024, The Hartford was in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility. \nFor further information regarding the Lloyd's Facility, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n|\nPENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nWhile the Company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, minimum contributions are mandated in certain circumstances pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21) and Internal Revenue Code regulations. The Company did not make any contributions to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2024, 2023 and 2022. In 2023, the Company funded $3 to a rabbi trust that is designated for other defined benefit pension plans and contributed $1 to the Canadian Pension Plan. There were no plan contributions in 2024 or 2022 for other defined benefit pension plans. The Company made direct benefit payments of $6, $5 and $5 on behalf of the other postretirement plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No other contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company’s 2024, 2023 and 2022 required minimum funding contributions were immaterial. The Company does not have a 2025 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the funding requirements for all pension plans are expected to be immaterial. The Company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2025. The Company will monitor the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined \n109\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nbenefit pension plan during 2025 to make this determination. As of December 31, 2024, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is fully funded and in an asset position. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n|\nDERIVATIVE COMMITMENTS\nCertain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could terminate agreements and demand immediate settlement of the outstanding net derivative positions transacted under each agreement. For further information, refer to Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, no derivative positions would be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings. This could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.\n|\nINSURANCE OPERATIONS\nWhile subject to variability period to period, underwriting and investment cash flows continue to provide sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated demands.\nThe principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from insurance and administrative service agreements, and investment income, while investing cash flows primarily originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. \nThe Company’s insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as “Property & Casualty Operations”) and Employee Benefits products.\nThe Company's insurance operations hold fixed maturity securities, including a significant short-term investment position (securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase), to meet liquidity needs. Liquidity requirements that are unable to be funded by the Company's insurance operations' short-term investments would be satisfied with current operating funds, including premiums or investing cash flows, which includes proceeds received through the sale of invested assets. A sale of invested assets could result in significant realized losses.\nThe following tables represent the fixed maturity holdings, including the aforementioned cash and short-term investments available to meet liquidity needs, for each of the Company’s insurance operations.\nProperty & Casualty\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nFixed maturities\n$\n34,675 \nShort-term investments\n2,075 \nCash\n148 \nLess: Derivative collateral\n64 \nTotal\n$\n36,834\n \nProperty & Casualty operations invested assets also include $212 in equity securities, $4.8 billion in mortgage loans and $4.0 billion in limited partnerships and other alternative investments.\nEmployee Benefits Operations\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nFixed maturities\n$\n8,013 \nShort-term investments\n389 \nCash\n26 \nLess: Derivative collateral\n16 \nTotal\n$\n8,412\n \nEmployee Benefits operations invested assets also include $46 in equity securities, $1.6 billion in mortgage loans and $1.1 billion in limited partnerships and other alternative investments.\nThe primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting and insurance operating costs, to pay taxes, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the HIG Holding Company.\nProperty & Casualty reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2024 were $36.4 billion and net of reinsurance and other recoverables were $29.7 billion. Reserves for Property & Casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include case reserves and IBNR reserves. The ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case and IBNR reserves is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the Company reaches a settlement with the claimant. Final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future. For a discussion of The Hartford’s judgment in estimating reserves for Property & Casualty see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property & Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance, and for historical payments by reserve line net of reinsurance, see Note 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The timing of future payments for the next twelve months and for beyond twelve months could vary materially from historical payment patterns due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular, there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims.\nEmployee Benefits reserves as of December 31, 2024 were $8.9 billion and net of reinsurance were $8.6 billion. Group life and disability obligations are estimated using assumptions based on the Company’s historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. For a discussion of The Hartford’s judgment in estimating LTD reserves for Employee Benefits see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Employee \n110\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

For additional information about future policy benefits and other policyholder funds and benefits payable, see Note 11 - Reserve for Future Policy Benefits and Note 12 - Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For historical payments by reserve line, net of reinsurance, see Note 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, payments for the next twelve months and beyond twelve months could materially differ from historical patterns.\nCorporate includes reserves as of December 31, 2024 were $371, and net of reinsurance were $147. These reserves related to retained run-off liabilities of its former life and annuity business. For additional information about future policy benefits and other policyholder funds and benefits payable, see Note 11 - Reserve for Future Policy Benefits and Note 12 - Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHartford Funds\nHartford Funds' principal sources of operating funds are fees earned from basis points on assets under management with uses primarily for payments to subadvisors and other general operating expenses. As of December 31, 2024, Hartford Funds cash and short-term investments were $300.\n|\nPURCHASE AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nThe Hartford’s unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, mortgage loans, private debt and equity securities, as well as tax credits are disclosed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is anticipated that these unfunded commitments will be funded through the Company’s normal operating and investing activities.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, and information technology. The Company’s operating lease commitments are disclosed in Note 20 - Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

There can be no assurance that the Company’s ratings will continue for any given period of time, or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company’s ratings are downgraded, the Company’s competitive position, ability to access financing, and its cost of borrowing, may be adversely impacted. \nThese ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of The Hartford’s securities and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the rating organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. The system and the number of rating categories can vary across rating agencies.\nAmong other factors, rating agencies consider the level of statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries as well as the level of GAAP capital held by the Company in determining the Company's financial strength and credit ratings. Rating agencies may implement changes to their capital formulas that have the effect of increasing the amount of capital \nwe must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt.”\nInsurance Financial Strength Ratings as of February 20, 2025\nA.M.

Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, U.S. STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.\n•\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for U.S. GAAP, while under U.S. STAT goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill admitted as an asset is limited.\n•\nThe deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance for losses ceded to the Navigators and A&E ADC agreements is recognized within a special category of surplus under U.S. STAT but is recognized within other liabilities under U.S. GAAP. In addition, the pattern of amortizing the deferred gain for GAAP and releasing special surplus for STAT is different. For GAAP the deferred gain is amortized in proportion of actual recoveries collected to total expected recoveries, while for STAT special surplus is released dollar for dollar once recoveries collected exceed the reinsurance premium.\nIn addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under U.S. STAT. U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.\n|\nRISK BASED CAPITAL\nThe Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose RBC requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's U.S. operating insurance \nsubsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.\nSimilar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries expect to maintain capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.\n113\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n|\nSENSITIVITY\nIn any particular period, statutory capital amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory capital or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. For further discussion on these factors, see MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management, Financial Risk on Statutory Capital.\nStatutory capital at the insurance subsidiaries has been maintained at capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired RBC ratios and ratings from rating agencies. The amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting insurance results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.\n|\nCONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nFor a discussion regarding The Hartford’s legal proceedings, see the information contained in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 3 — Legal Proceedings, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has issued final rules to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures for investors. The SEC rules are being challenged in the courts, and on April 4, 2024 the SEC voluntarily stayed the rules pending judicial review. If they become operative in their current form, the rules will require extensive narrative and quantitative reporting on climate change and decarbonization in SEC filings and financial statements and pose potential compliance and regulatory risks to the Company, beginning in fiscal year 2025. The State of California has enacted laws that impose similarly extensive compliance burdens on the Company, entailing like compliance and regulatory risks. Other jurisdictions may follow suit. However, the California laws are facing legal challenges as well and the overall state of these types of climate related disclosure regimes, whether at the state or federal level, remains uncertain.\nCongress may consider a variety of proposals including a possible increase in the corporate tax rate to offset the cost of \nany new spending. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives that may be considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any such Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear.\nGuaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments\n \nFor a discussion regarding Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments, see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a discussion of accounting standards, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n114\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Controls and Procedures\nItem 9A. \nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2024.\nMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \nThe management of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Hartford's management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \nATTESTATION REPORT OF THE COMPANY'S REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nThe Hartford's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which is set forth below.\n116\n|\nTable of Contents\nPart II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nThe Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.\nHartford, Connecticut\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) (formerly The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate\n.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 21, 2025\n117\n|\nTable of Contents\nPart II - Item 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Refer to Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description\nFor property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. \nGiven the subjectivity of estimating the ultimate cost to settle the liabilities for reported and unreported claims due to uncertainties caused by various factors including frequency and severity of claims as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2024, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.\n122\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included the following, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses,\n \nincluding controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company's estimation processes.\n•\nWe tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s analysis, including historical claims.\n•\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses by:\n–\nAssessing the reasonableness of the Company’s analysis and, for selected reserving lines, developing independent estimates of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and comparing such estimates to the Company’s estimates.\n \n–\nComparing the Company’s prior year assumptions of expected development of ultimate loss to actual losses incurred during the current year to identify potential management bias in the determination of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\n \nInvestments in Fixed Maturities Classified as Available-for-Sale - Refer to Notes 1, 4, and 5 to the financial statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description \nInvestments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value in the financial statements. Certain investments without readily determinable fair values were valued using significant unobservable inputs, such as credit spreads and interest rates beyond the observable curve, that involved considerable judgment by the Company. \nGiven the Company used models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of certain investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, performing audit procedures to evaluate these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \nOur audit procedures related to the models and unobservable inputs used by the Company to estimate the fair value of certain investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company’s estimation processes. \n•\nOn a sample basis, we tested the accuracy and completeness of the investments owned as of December 31, 2024, and the relevant security attributes used in the determination of their fair values.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, for a sample of investments, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the fair value calculation and developed independent estimates of the fair value and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates. In addition to developing independent estimates, we obtained an understanding of the models and inputs used by the Company and assessed those models and inputs for reasonableness. Such assessment included comparing inputs to external sources or developing independent inputs.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 21, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s

Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \nThe Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. (\"HIG\") is a holding company for insurance and financial services subsidiaries that provide property and casualty (\"P&C\") insurance, employee group benefits insurance and services and mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (\"ETF\") to individual and business customers in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom and other international locations (collectively, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”). Previously known as The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., the Company changed its name to The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. on February 6, 2025.\nThe Hartford conducts business principally in \nfive\n reportable segments including Business Insurance (formerly \"Commercial Lines\"), Personal Insurance (formerly \"Personal Lines\"), Property & Casualty Other Operations, Employee Benefits (formerly \"Group Benefits\") and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) which differ materially from the accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.\n \nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc., and entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but does not control are reported using the equity method. Intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford and its subsidiaries and affiliates have been eliminated.\n \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty and group long-term disability (\"LTD\") insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; evaluation of goodwill for impairment; valuation of investments and derivative instruments; and contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nSegment Disclosures\nO\nn \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the Company \nadopted\n the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) new guidance on \nSegment Reporting\n, that was applied on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. The new guidance requires enhanced disclosures on an annual and quarterly basis about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss, as well as disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and a description of how the reported measure of profit or loss is used to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The Company has included the new disclosures in Note 3 - Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company will also provide the quarterly disclosures beginning with the March 31, 2025 interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The new guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n129\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFuture Adoption of New Accounting Standards\nIncome Tax Disclosures\nThe FASB issued new disclosure requirements for income taxes primarily for the \nincome tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid\n. The income tax rate reconciliation within the income taxes note will present reconciling items based on specified categories with further disaggregation of items above a prescribed threshold. Disclosure of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) in the consolidated statement of cash flows will be disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes with further disaggregation by individual jurisdictions subject to a prescribed threshold. The Company is required to provide the new disclosure annually beginning with the \nDecember 31, 2025\n consolidated financial statements. Disclosures are required to be provided on a prospective basis with retrospective application permitted. The Company is evaluating the disclosure impact of the new guidance; however, the new guidance will not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nDisaggregated Income Statement Expenses\nThe FASB issued new guidance on \ndisclosures of disaggregated income statement expenses\n. The new guidance requires footnote disclosures that will disaggregate expenses included in relevant expense captions into prescribed categories, as well as narrative disclosures about selling expenses. The Company is required to provide the new disclosures beginning with the \nDecember 31, 2027\n consolidated financial statements and on a quarterly basis beginning with the March 31, 2028 interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The new guidance will be applied on \na prospective basis\n, with retrospective application or early adoption permitted.  The Company is evaluating the disclosure impact of the new guidance; however, it will not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nPremium Revenue from Direct Insurance and Assumed Reinsurance\nProperty and casualty premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us, as well as ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. We estimate the amount of premium not yet reported based on current and historical trends of the business being written. Such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year's results. Unearned premiums \nrepresent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force, or period of risk. \nGroup life, disability and accident premiums are generally due from policyholders, and recognized as revenue, on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.\nAn estimated ACL is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds and considering historical credit loss information, adjusted for current economic conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The Company records total credit loss expenses related to premiums receivable in insurance operating costs and other expenses. Write-offs of premiums receivable and agents' balances and any related ACL are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. Refer to Note 7 - Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances for further discussion regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances.\nNon-Insurance Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nInstallment fees are charged on property and casualty insurance contracts for billing the insurance customer in installments over the policy term. These fees are recognized in fee income as earned on collection.\nInsurance servicing revenues within Personal Insurance consist of up-front commissions earned for collecting premiums and processing claims on insurance policies for which The Hartford does not assume underwriting risk, predominantly related to the National Flood Insurance Plan program. These insurance servicing revenues are recognized in other revenues over the period of the flood program's policy terms.\nEmployee Benefits earns fee income from employers for the administration of underwriting, implementation and claims processing for employer self-funded plans and for leave management services. Fees are recognized as services are provided and collected monthly.\nHartford Funds provides investment management, administrative and distribution services to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The Company assesses investment advisory, distribution and other asset management fees primarily based on the average daily net asset values from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected monthly. Fluctuations in domestic and international markets and related investment performance, volume and mix of sales and redemptions of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, and other changes to the composition of assets under management (\"AUM\") are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.\nCorporate investment management and other fees are primarily for managing third party invested assets. These fees, calculated based on the average quarterly net asset values, are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected quarterly. Fluctuations in markets and interest rates and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.\n130\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nDividends to Policyholders\nPolicyholder dividends are paid to certain property and casualty policyholders. Policies that receive dividends are referred to as participating policies. Participating dividends to policyholders are accrued and reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses and other liabilities using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.\nNet written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance policies represented \n6\n%, \n6\n%, and \n7\n% of total net written premiums for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Participating dividends to property and casualty policyholders were $\n39\n, $\n39\n and $\n29\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThere were \nno\n additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders.\nInvestments\nOverview\nThe Company’s investments in fixed maturities consist of bonds, including structured securities, and redeemable preferred stock. Most of these investments are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value. The after tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected the fair value option are classified as FVO and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in net realized gains and losses. These investments represent certain investments in residual interests of securitizations and other securities that contain embedded credit derivatives. Equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net realized gains and losses. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of an ACL. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally received on a three-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships. Other investments primarily consist of equity fund investments measured at fair value, overseas deposits which are measured at fair value using the net asset value as a practical expedient, consolidated investment funds for which the Company has provided seed money and reports the underlying investments at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in income consistent with accounting requirements \nfor investment companies, and derivative instruments which are carried at fair value.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses\nNet realized gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized gains and losses also result from fair value changes in equity securities, FVO securities, and derivatives contracts that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes. The Company records net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and changes in the ACL on mortgage loans as a component of net realized gains and losses. Future changes in the ACL resulting from improvements in expected future cash flows are recorded through net realized gains and losses.\nNet Investment Income\nInterest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on the estimated timing of cash flows. Most premiums and discounts on fixed maturities are amortized to the maturity date. Premiums on callable bonds may be amortized to call dates based on call prices. For structured financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method. For certain other structured securities, including securities that previously had an ACL and interest only securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings. For fixed maturities with an ACL, net investment income is recognized at the original effective rate and accretion of the ACL is recognized through net realized gains and losses. The Company’s non-income producing investments were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nAccrued Investment Income\nAccrued investment income primarily includes accruals of interest and dividend income from investments that have been earned but not yet received.\nDerivative Instruments\nOverview\nThe Company utilizes a variety of over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives, derivatives cleared through central clearing houses (\"OTC-cleared\") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to engage in income generation covered call transactions and replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, \n131\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ncaps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve the following Company-approved objectives: \n•\nto hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rates or volatility; \n•\nto manage liquidity; \n•\nto control transaction costs; and\n•\nto enter into income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions.\nInterest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.\nThe Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 6 - Derivatives. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which is characterized as interest and reflected in net investment income. \nForward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.\nFinancial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.\nOption contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.\nForeign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.\nThe Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the \nderivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance regulators.\nAccounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in \nOther Investments and Other Liabilities\n. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.\nOn the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.\nCash Flow Hedges\n - \nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \nOther Investment and/or Risk Management Activities\n - \nThe Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized gains and losses.\nHedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing\nTo qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to \n132\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nspecific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item.\nDiscontinuance of Hedge Accounting\nThe Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\nWhen cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.\nIn other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nThe Company may purchase investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized gains and losses.\nCredit Risk of Derivative Instruments\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require \ndaily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is \npledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds, if applicable. The Co\nmpany also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.\nCash and Restricted Cash\nCash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. Restrictions on cash primarily relate to funds that are held to support regulatory and contractual obligations.\nReinsurance\nThe Company cedes insurance to other insurers in order to limit its maximum losses, to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.\nReinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e., risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as deposit transactions. The Company had \nno\n deposit liability as of December 31, 2024 or and 2023 reported in other liabilities.\nPremiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums, which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables are balances due from reinsurers for ceded paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Changes in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its reinsurance recoverable assets and establishes an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The allowance for \n133\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nuncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. Based on this analysis, the Company may adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The Company records credit losses related to reinsurance recoverables in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses. Write-offs of reinsurance recoverables and any related ACL are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. Expected recoveries are included in the estimate of the ACL. \nRetroactive reinsurance agreements, including adverse development covers (\"ADC\"), are reinsurance agreements under which our reinsurer agrees to reimburse us as a result of loss development related to past insurable events. For these agreements, the consideration paid in excess of the estimated ultimate losses to be recovered under the agreement at inception is recognized as a loss on reinsurance transaction. The benefit of subsequent adverse development ceded up to the total consideration paid is recognized as ceded losses, which are a reduction of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. The excess of the estimated amounts ultimately to be recovered under the agreement over the consideration paid is recognized as a deferred gain liability and amortized into income over the period the ceded losses are recovered in cash from the reinsurer. The amount of the deferred gain liability is recalculated each period based on cumulative recoveries not yet collected relative to the latest estimate of ultimate losses to be recovered. Ceded loss reserves under retroactive agreements were $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion, and the deferred gain liability reported in other liabilities was $\n914\n and $\n997\n, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In any given period, the change in deferred gain included in net income includes amortization of the deferred gain based on the percentage of ultimate ceded losses collected plus any change in the deferred gain liability due to changes in the estimated ultimate losses to be recovered. The effect on income from change in the deferred gain was a net charge or (benefit) to earnings of $(\n83\n), $\n194\n and $\n229\n before tax for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\n \nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDAC represents costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts and incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with independent third parties or in compensation to employees. Such costs primarily include commissions, premium taxes, costs and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully issued contracts, including a portion of policy issuance and underwriting costs.\nFor P&C insurance products and group life, disability and accident contracts, costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of DAC.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax provision is recorded for the tax effects of temporary differences between the Company's current taxable income and its income before tax under generally accepted accounting principles in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For deferred tax assets, the Company records a valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Goodwill is impaired up to the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated consist of Business Insurance, Personal Insurance, Employee Benefits, and Hartford Funds. \nManagement’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital required to support the business, future business growth, earnings projections, the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting and, for the Hartford Funds segment, assets under management. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairments.\nIntangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include purchased customer relationship and agency or other distribution rights and licenses measured at fair value at acquisition. The Company amortizes finite-lived other intangible assets over their useful lives generally on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, ranging from \n1\n to \n15\n years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. Finite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the \n134\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ncarrying amount exceeds fair value. Impaired intangible assets are written down to fair value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes capitalized software and right-of-use lease assets, is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is recognized principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $\n2.5\n billion and $\n2.4\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation expense was $\n177\n, $\n204\n, and $\n213\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses. The costs to access and develop hosted software arrangements, where The Hartford has the right to access and use the software, but not take possession, and the cost of certain software licenses are reported in other assets on a straight-line basis over the service period. Amortization of hosted software and certain software licenses was $\n108\n, $\n85\n, and $\n78\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and is reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses.\nLeases\nLeases are classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease is classified as a financing lease and the Company recognizes amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease is not economically similar to a purchase as the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease is an operating lease and the lease cost is recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less are also expensed over the lease term but not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nFor property and casualty and group life, disability and accident insurance and assumed reinsurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future losses and loss adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. In addition, a number of complex factors influence the uncertainties involved with the reserving process including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until \nwell into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by reserve line within the various reportable segments. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.\nMost of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted to present value certain reserves for indemnity payments that are due to claimants under workers’ compensation policies because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rate is based on the risk free rate for the expected claim duration as determined in the year the claims were incurred. The Company also has discounted liabilities for structured settlement agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. These structured settlements include annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants. These structured settlement liabilities are discounted to present value using the rate implicit in the purchased annuities and the purchased annuities are accounted for within reinsurance recoverables.\nGroup life and disability contracts with long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned on the cash flows net of investment expenses and expected credit losses. The Company establishes discount rates for these reserves in the year the claims are incurred (the incurral year) which is when the estimated settlement pattern is determined. The discount rate for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business were based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017.\nFor further information about how unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established, see Note 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\nReserve for Future Policy Benefits\nThe Company’s reserves for future policy benefits includes paid-up life insurance and whole-life policies resulting from conversion from group life policies included within the Employee Benefits segment and reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, which are reported in the Corporate category. \nContracts are grouped into cohorts by contract type and issue year. The Company establishes reserves for future policy benefits using the net premium approach, which represents the present value of future policyholder benefits and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Net premiums are calculated by multiplying gross premiums for the contracts in a specific cohort by a net premium ratio. The net premium ratio is determined for the lifetime of a given cohort as the present value of net benefits divided by the present value of gross premiums. Related expenses include termination and settlement costs and exclude acquisition costs and non-claim related costs, such as costs relating to investments, general administration, policy maintenance, product development, \n135\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nmarket research and general overhead or any other costs, which are expensed as incurred. \nThe Company estimates premiums, benefits and related expense cash flows using methods that include assumptions, such as estimates of mortality, lapse, and claim-related expenses, and the possible impact of inflation on those expenses. Benefits include all guaranteed cash flows to be paid to the policyholder. \nThe reserve for future policy benefits is adjusted for differences between actual and expected experience. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimates of cash flows expected over the life of a group of contracts using actual historical experience. These updated cash flows are used to calculate the revised net premiums and net premium ratio, which are used to derive an updated reserve for future policy benefits. In subsequent periods, the revised net premiums are used to measure the reserve for future policy benefits, subject to future revisions. Future cash flow assumptions, including mortality, lapse and expense are reviewed and, if a change is indicated, updated at least annually in the third quarter. \nThe difference between the newly calculated reserve balance and the reserve balance before updating for actual experience and/or future cash flow assumptions is the remeasurement gain or loss, which is immaterial for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and is presented in benefits losses and loss adjustments expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes to the reserve due to updates to cash flow assumptions, discounted at the discount rate used when each annual cohort was established, are recognized on a catch-up basis in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \nThe discount rate assumption is an equivalent single rate that is based on a current market observable, upper-medium grade fixed maturity yield. This has been interpreted to represent a yield based on single-A credit rated fixed maturity instruments with similar duration to the liability. The Company uses the yield of a market observable index of single-A credit rated fixed maturities as the basis for setting the discount rate. The discount rate assumption is updated quarterly and the change in the reserve estimate resulting from updating the discount rate assumption is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is the cost of common stock repurchased, which includes the purchase price of shares acquired and direct costs to acquire shares, including commissions and excise taxes. Issuance and retirement of treasury stock is recognized at the average cost of shares held in treasury.\nForeign Currency\nForeign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The national currencies of the international operations are generally their functional currencies; however, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 (\"Lloyd's Syndicate\"), for which the Company is the sole corporate member. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings in net realized gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.\n2.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company currently conducts business principally in \nfive\n reportable segments including Business Insurance, Personal Insurance, Property & Casualty Other Operations, Employee Benefits and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category. The reportable segments are described below and align with the Company’s key product and service offerings. \nOver 95% of the Company’s revenues are generated in the United States (“U.S.”). The remaining revenues are generated in the U.K. and other international locations.\nWe report our results of operations consistent with the manner in which our CODM reviews the busin\ness, \nassesses performance, and makes operating decisions on the allocation of resources to each reportable segment. The CODM considers actual results and budget-to-actual variances when assessing segment performance and making decisions on the allocation of resources to each segment. The Company’s CODM is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.   \nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has identified GAAP net income as the reported measure of segment profit or loss.\nThe Company’s reportable segments, as well as the Corporate category, are as follows:\nBusiness Insurance\nBusiness Insurance provides a variety of insurance products and risk management services in the U.S. and internationally to commercial enterprises of varying sizes, with insurance coverages including workers’ compensation, property, automobile, general liability, umbrella, package business, professional liability, bond, marine, livestock, accident and health, and assumed reinsurance.\nPersonal Insurance\nPersonal Insurance provides standard automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to individuals across the U.S., including a special program designed exclusively for members of AARP through an agreement that is in place through December 31, 2032.\nProperty & Casualty Other Operations\nP&C Other Operations includes certain property and casualty operations, managed by the Company, that have discontinued \nwriting new business and includes substantially all of the Company’s asbestos and environmental (\"A&E\") exposures.\nEmployee Benefits\nEmployee Benefits provides employers and associations with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and services, including voluntary benefits, and group retiree health.\nHartford Funds\nHartford Funds offers investment products for retail and retirement accounts and provides investment management, distribution and administrative services such as product design, implementation and oversight. This business also manages a portion of the mutual funds which support third-party life and annuity separate accounts.\nCorporate\nThe Company includes in the Corporate category capital raising activities (including equity financing, debt financing and related interest expense), purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill, reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, restructuring costs, transaction expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition, certain M&A costs, and other expenses not allocated to the reportable segments. Interest expense of $\n199\n, $\n199\n and $\n213\n, on debt for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is included in the Corporate category. Corporate also includes investment management fees and expenses related to managing third party assets.\nFinancial Measures and Other Segment Information\nCertain transactions between segments occur during the year that primarily relate to tax settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements, services provided, investment transfers and capital contributions. In addition, certain inter-segment transactions occur that relate to interest income on allocated surplus. Consolidated net income is unaffected by such transactions.\n137\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 - Segment Information\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nSegment Revenues\n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBusiness Insurance\nWorkers’ compensation\n$\n3,691\n \n$\n3,670\n \n$\n3,499\n \nGeneral liability\n2,218\n \n1,977\n \n1,836\n \nMarine\n278\n \n256\n \n235\n \nPackage business\n2,331\n \n2,076\n \n1,844\n \nCommercial property\n1,258\n \n1,053\n \n845\n \nProfessional Liability\n824\n \n787\n \n737\n \nBond\n327\n \n321\n \n303\n \nAssumed reinsurance\n758\n \n615\n \n467\n \nCommercial automobile\n1,079\n \n927\n \n844\n \nBusiness Insurance earned premium and fee income\n12,764\n \n11,682\n \n10,610\n \nNet investment income\n1,714\n \n1,532\n \n1,415\n \nNet realized losses\n(\n73\n)\n(\n156\n)\n(\n385\n)\nOther revenue [1]\n1\n \n1\n \n(\n1\n)\nTotal Business Insurance\n14,406\n \n13,059\n \n11,639\n \nPersonal Insurance\n \n \n \nPersonal automobile\n2,425\n \n2,156\n \n2,047\n \nHomeowners\n1,061\n \n961\n \n932\n \nPersonal Insurance earned premium and fee income [2]\n3,486\n \n3,117\n \n2,979\n \nNet investment income\n222\n \n171\n \n140\n \nNet realized losses\n(\n14\n)\n(\n16\n)\n(\n35\n)\nOther revenue\n85\n \n81\n \n73\n \nTotal Personal Insurance\n3,779\n \n3,353\n \n3,157\n \nP&C Other Operations\nNet investment income\n74\n \n69\n \n63\n \nNet realized losses\n(\n4\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n16\n)\nTotal P&C Other Operations\n70\n \n62\n \n47\n \nEmployee Benefits\n \n \n \nGroup disability\n3,576\n \n3,530\n \n3,310\n \nGroup life\n2,617\n \n2,583\n \n2,393\n \nOther\n422\n \n402\n \n354\n \nEmployee Benefits premium and other considerations\n6,615\n \n6,515\n \n6,057\n \nNet investment income\n475\n \n469\n \n524\n \nNet realized losses\n(\n24\n)\n(\n45\n)\n(\n122\n)\nTotal Employee Benefits\n7,066\n \n6,939\n \n6,459\n \nHartford Funds\nMutual fund and ETF\n960\n \n900\n \n964\n \nThird-party life and annuity separate accounts [3]\n75\n \n73\n \n80\n \nHartford Funds fee income\n1,035\n \n973\n \n1,044\n \nNet investment income\n20\n \n17\n \n9\n \nNet realized gains (losses)\n12\n \n10\n \n(\n24\n)\nTotal Hartford Funds\n1,067\n \n1,000\n \n1,029\n \nTotal segment revenues\n$\n26,388\n \n$\n24,413\n \n$\n22,331\n \n[1]\nOther revenues for Business Insurance includes revenues from equity method investments that are not considered revenues from contracts with customers in the table below. \n[2]\nFor 2024, 2023 and 2022, AARP members accounted for earned premiums of $\n3.2\n billion, $\n2.9\n billion and $\n2.7\n billion, respectively.\n[3]\nRepresents revenues earned for investment advisory services on third party life and annuity separate account AUM by the Company's Hartford Funds segment.\n \n138\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 -

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \nThe Company carries certain financial assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. Our fair value framework includes a hierarchy that gives the highest priority to the use of quoted prices in active markets, followed by the use of market observable inputs, followed by the use of unobservable inputs. \nThe fair value hierarchy levels are as follows:\nLevel 1    Fair values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities, in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.\n141\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 - Fair Value Measurements\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nLevel 2    Fair values primarily based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, or based on prices for similar assets and liabilities.\nLevel 3    Fair values derived when one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable (including assumptions about risk). With little or no observable market, the determination of fair values uses considerable judgment and represents the Company’s best estimate of an amount that could be realized in a market exchange for the asset or liability. Also included are securities that are traded within illiquid markets and/or priced by independent brokers.\nThe Company will classify the financial asset or liability by level based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. In most cases, both observable inputs (e.g., changes in interest rates) and unobservable inputs (e.g., changes in risk assumptions) are used to determine fair values that the Company has classified within Level 3.\nAssets and (Liabilities) Carried at Fair Value by Hierarchy Level as of December 31, 2024\nTotal\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets\nfor Identical\nAssets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nAssets accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n \n \n \n \nFixed maturities, AFS\n \n \n \n \nAsset-backed securities (\"ABS\")\n$\n3,937\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,915\n \n$\n22\n \nCollateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\")\n3,250\n \n—\n \n3,134\n \n116\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\")\n2,736\n \n—\n \n2,569\n \n167\n \nCorporate\n20,636\n \n—\n \n18,355\n \n2,281\n \nForeign government/government agencies\n480\n \n—\n \n480\n \n—\n \nMunicipal\n5,304\n \n—\n \n5,304\n \n—\n \nResidential mortgage-backed securities (\"RMBS\")\n5,230\n \n—\n \n5,206\n \n24\n \nU.S. Treasuries\n994\n \n57\n \n937\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed maturities, AFS\n42,567\n \n57\n \n39,900\n \n2,610\n \nFVO securities\n308\n \n—\n \n111\n \n197\n \nEquity securities, at fair value [1]\n603\n \n372\n \n144\n \n87\n \nDerivative assets\nCredit derivatives\n30\n \n—\n \n30\n \n—\n \nEquity derivatives\n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \nForeign exchange derivatives\n23\n \n—\n \n23\n \n—\n \nTotal derivative assets [2]\n57\n \n—\n \n57\n \n—\n \nShort-term investments\n4,068\n \n1,271\n \n2,699\n \n98\n \nTotal assets accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n$\n47,603\n \n$\n1,700\n \n$\n42,911\n \n$\n2,992\n \nLiabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n \n \n \n \nDerivative liabilities\n \n \n \n \nCredit derivatives\n$\n(\n30\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n30\n)\n$\n—\n \nForeign exchange derivatives\n18\n \n—\n \n18\n \n—\n \nTotal derivative liabilities [3]\n(\n12\n)\n—\n \n(\n12\n)\n—\n \nTotal liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n$\n(\n12\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n12\n)\n$\n—\n \n142\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 - Fair Value Measurements\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nAssets and (Liabilities) Carried at Fair Value by Hierarchy Level as of December 31, 2023\nTotal\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets\nfor Identical\nAssets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nAssets accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n \n \n \n \nFixed maturities, AFS\n \n \n \n \nABS\n$\n3,320\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,320\n \n$\n—\n \nCLOs\n3,090\n \n—\n \n2,977\n \n113\n \nCMBS\n3,125\n \n—\n \n2,898\n \n227\n \nCorporate\n17,866\n \n—\n \n16,005\n \n1,861\n \nForeign government/government agencies\n562\n \n—\n \n562\n \n—\n \nMunicipal\n6,039\n \n—\n \n6,039\n \n—\n \nRMBS\n4,287\n \n—\n \n4,251\n \n36\n \nU.S. Treasuries\n1,529\n \n18\n \n1,511\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed maturities, AFS\n39,818\n \n18\n \n37,563\n \n2,237\n \nFVO securities\n327\n \n—\n \n160\n \n167\n \nEquity securities, at fair value [1]\n864\n \n333\n \n473\n \n58\n \nDerivative assets\nCredit derivatives\n(\n10\n)\n—\n \n(\n10\n)\n—\n \nForeign exchange derivatives\n9\n \n—\n \n9\n \n—\n \nTotal derivative assets [2]\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nShort-term investments\n3,850\n \n1,400\n \n2,425\n \n25\n \nTotal assets accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n$\n44,858\n \n$\n1,751\n \n$\n40,620\n \n$\n2,487\n \nLiabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n \n \n \n \nDerivative liabilities\n \n \n \n \nCredit derivatives\n$\n10\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n—\n \nForeign exchange derivatives\n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \nInterest rate derivatives\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \n(\n6\n)\n—\n \nTotal derivative liabilities [3]\n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \nTotal liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis\n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n[1]\nLevel 3 includes investments that have contractual sales restrictions that require consent to sell and are in place for the duration that the securities are held by the Company.\n[2]\nIncludes derivative instruments in a net positive fair value position after consideration of the accrued interest and impact of collateral posting requirements which may be imposed by agreements and applicable law.

Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a \"waterfall\" approach comprised of the following pricing sources and techniques, which are listed in priority order:\n•\nQuoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, which are classified as Level 1.\n•\nPrices from third-party pricing services, which primarily utilize a combination of techniques. These services utilize recently reported trades of identical, similar, or benchmark securities making adjustments for market observable inputs \n143\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 - Fair Value Measurements\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\navailable through the reporting date. If there are no recently reported trades, they may use a discounted cash flow technique to develop a price using expected cash flows based upon the anticipated future performance of the underlying collateral discounted at an estimated market rate. Both techniques develop prices that consider the time value of future cash flows and provide a margin for risk, including liquidity and credit risk. Most prices provided by third-party pricing services are classified as Level 2 because the inputs used in pricing the securities are observable. However, some securities that are less liquid or trade less actively are classified as Level 3. Additionally, certain long-dated securities include benchmark interest rate or credit spread assumptions that are not observable in the marketplace and are thus classified as Level 3.\n•\nInternal matrix pricing is a valuation process internally developed for private placement securities for which the Company is unable to obtain a price from a third-party pricing service. Internal pricing matrices determine credit spreads that, when combined with risk-free rates, are applied to contractual cash flows to develop a price. The Company develops credit spreads using market based data for public securities adjusted for credit spread differentials between public and private securities, which are obtained from a survey of multiple private placement brokers. The market-based reference credit spread considers the issuer’s sector, financial strength, and term to maturity, using an independent public security index, while the credit spread differential considers the non-public nature of the security. Securities priced using internal matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 because the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated with observable data.\n•\nIndependent broker quotes, which are typically non-binding, use inputs that can be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data. Brokers may use present value techniques using assumptions specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.\nThe fair value of derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporates counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted \nmarket prices for exchange-traded and OTC cleared derivatives may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. The pricing valuation models primarily use inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. The valuation of certain derivatives may include significant inputs that are unobservable, such as volatility levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments. \nValuation Controls\nThe process for determining the fair value of investments is monitored by the Valuation Committee, which is a cross-functional group of senior management within the Company. The purpose of the Valuation Committee is to provide oversight of the pricing policy, procedures and controls, including approval of valuation methodologies and pricing sources. The Valuation Committee reviews market data trends, pricing statistics and trading statistics to ensure that prices are reasonable and consistent with our fair value framework. Controls and procedures used to assess third-party pricing services are reviewed by the Valuation Committee, including the results of annual due-diligence reviews. Controls include, but are not limited to, reviewing daily and monthly price changes, stale prices, and missing prices and comparing new trade prices to third-party pricing services, weekly price changes to published bond index prices, and daily OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations. The Company has a dedicated pricing group that works with trading and investment professionals to challenge prices received by a third party pricing source if the Company believes that the valuation received does not accurately reflect the fair value. New valuation models and changes to current models require approval by the Valuation Committee. In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.\nValuation Inputs\nQuoted prices for identical assets in active markets are considered Level 1 and consist of on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, exchange-traded equity securities, open-ended mutual funds, certain short-term investments, and exchange traded derivative instruments.\n144\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 -

While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease.

Non-cash investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024, included $\n18\n related to the exchange of short-term investments for equity securities. Non-cash investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, included $\n80\n, related to the exchange of short-term investments for mortgage loans.\nAccrued Investment Income on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Mortgage Loans\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company reported accrued investment income related to fixed maturities, AFS of $\n412\n and $\n371\n, respectively, and accrued investment income related to mortgage loans of $\n22\n and $\n20\n, respectively. These amounts are not included in the carrying value of the fixed maturities or mortgage loans. Investment income on fixed maturities and mortgage loans is accrued unless it is past due over 90 days or management deems the interest uncollectible. The Company does not include the current accrued investment income balance when estimating the ACL. The Company has a policy to write-off accrued investment income balances that are more than 90 days past due. Write-\n149\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 5 - Investments\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\noffs of accrued investment income are recorded as a credit loss component of net realized gains and losses.\nRecognition and Presentation of Intent-to-Sell Impairments and ACL on Fixed Maturities, AFS\nThe Company will record an \"intent-to-sell impairment\" as a reduction to the amortized cost of fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position if the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the fixed maturity before a recovery in value. A corresponding charge is recorded in net realized losses equal to the difference between the fair value on the impairment date and the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity before recognizing the impairment.\nFor fixed maturities where a credit loss has been identified and no intent-to-sell impairment has been recorded, the Company will record an ACL for the portion of the unrealized loss related to the credit loss. Any remaining unrealized loss on a fixed maturity after recording an ACL is the non-credit amount and is recorded in OCI. The ACL is the excess of the amortized cost over the greater of the Company's best estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows or the security's fair value. Cash flows are discounted at the effective yield that is used to record interest income. The ACL cannot exceed the unrealized loss and, therefore, it may fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity if the fair value is greater than the Company's best estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows. The initial ACL and any subsequent changes are recorded in net realized gains and losses. The ACL is written off against the amortized cost in the period in which all or a \nportion of the related fixed maturity is determined to be uncollectible.\nDeveloping the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with certain internal assumptions regarding the future performance. The Company's considerations include, but are not limited to, (a) changes in the financial condition of the issuer and/or the underlying collateral, (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (c) credit ratings, (d) payment structure of the security and (e) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security.\nFor non-structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, economic and industry-specific trends and fundamentals, instrument-specific developments including changes in credit ratings, industry earnings multiples and the issuer’s ability to restructure, access capital markets, and execute asset sales.\nFor structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, various performance indicators such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current and projected delinquency rates, loan-to-value (\"LTV\n\")\n ratios, average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year, prepayment speeds, and property value declines. These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries which may include estimating the underlying collateral value.\nACL on Fixed Maturities, AFS by Type\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Before tax)\nCMBS\nCorporate\nTotal\nCMBS\nCorporate\nTotal\nCMBS\nCorporate\nForeign govt./govt. agencies\nTotal\nBalance as of beginning of period\n$\n12\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n21\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \nCredit losses on fixed maturities where an allowance was not previously recorded\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n9\n \n9\n \n7\n \n10\n \n3\n \n20\n \nReduction due to sales\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n(\n5\n)\n(\n5\n)\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n4\n)\nReduction due to intent to sell\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nNet increases (decreases) on fixed maturities where an allowance was previously recorded\n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n2\n \n3\n \n5\n \n3\n \n(\n3\n)\n1\n \n1\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\nBalance as of end of period\n$\n13\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n21\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n12\n \n150\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 5 - Investments\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFixed Maturities, AFS\nFixed Maturities, AFS, by Type\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized\nCost\nACL\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nAmortized\nCost\nACL\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nABS\n$\n3,948\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n(\n39\n)\n$\n3,937\n \n$\n3,347\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n(\n45\n)\n$\n3,320\n \nCLOs\n3,237\n \n—\n \n13\n \n—\n \n3,250\n \n3,104\n \n—\n \n3\n \n(\n17\n)\n3,090\n \nCMBS\n2,976\n \n(\n13\n)\n21\n \n(\n248\n)\n2,736\n \n3,466\n \n(\n12\n)\n19\n \n(\n348\n)\n3,125\n \nCorporate\n21,555\n \n(\n3\n)\n117\n \n(\n1,033\n)\n20,636\n \n18,691\n \n(\n9\n)\n197\n \n(\n1,013\n)\n17,866\n \nForeign govt./govt. agencies\n500\n \n—\n \n3\n \n(\n23\n)\n480\n \n583\n \n—\n \n6\n \n(\n27\n)\n562\n \nMunicipal\n5,574\n \n—\n \n77\n \n(\n347\n)\n5,304\n \n6,207\n \n—\n \n131\n \n(\n299\n)\n6,039\n \nRMBS\n5,610\n \n—\n \n13\n \n(\n393\n)\n5,230\n \n4,675\n \n—\n \n18\n \n(\n406\n)\n4,287\n \nU.S. Treasuries\n1,138\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n144\n)\n994\n \n1,653\n \n—\n \n26\n \n(\n150\n)\n1,529\n \nTotal fixed maturities, AFS\n$\n44,538\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\n$\n272\n \n$\n(\n2,227\n)\n$\n42,567\n \n$\n41,726\n \n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n418\n \n$\n(\n2,305\n)\n$\n39,818\n \nFixed Maturities, AFS, by Contractual Maturity Year\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost\nFair Value\nAmortized Cost\nFair Value\nOne year or less\n$\n1,308\n \n$\n1,298\n \n$\n1,526\n \n$\n1,501\n \nOver one year through five years\n9,564\n \n9,414\n \n9,670\n \n9,433\n \nOver five years through ten years\n7,687\n \n7,334\n \n6,568\n \n6,211\n \nOver ten years\n10,208\n \n9,368\n \n9,370\n \n8,851\n \nSubtotal\n28,767\n \n27,414\n \n27,134\n \n25,996\n \nMortgage-backed and asset-backed securities\n15,771\n \n15,153\n \n14,592\n \n13,822\n \nTotal fixed maturities, AFS\n$\n44,538\n \n$\n42,567\n \n$\n41,726\n \n$\n39,818\n \nEstimated maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions.

As of December 31, 2024, \n94\n% of these fixed maturities were depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The total gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2024 are largely consistent with year-end 2023.\nMost of the fixed maturities depressed for twelve months or more relate to the corporate sector, RMBS, municipal bonds, and CMBS, which were primarily depressed because current rates are higher and/or market spreads are wider than at the respective purchase dates. The Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell the fixed maturities outlined in the preceding discussion. The decision to record credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS in the form of an ACL requires us to make qualitative and quantitative estimates of expected future cash flows.\n152\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 5 - Investments\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nMortgage Loans\nACL on Mortgage Loans\nThe Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to estimate the ACL with changes in the ACL recorded in net realized gains and losses. Apart from an ACL recorded on individual mortgage loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company records an ACL on the pool of mortgage loans based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Company utilizes a third-party forecasting model to estimate lifetime expected credit losses at a loan level under multiple economic scenarios. The scenarios use macroeconomic data provided by an internationally recognized economics firm that generates forecasts of varying economic factors such as GDP growth, unemployment and interest rates. The economic scenarios are projected over 10 years. The first two to four years of the 10-year period assume a specific modeled economic scenario (including moderate upside, moderate recession and severe recession scenarios) and then revert to historical long-term assumptions over the remaining period. Using these economic scenarios, the forecasting model projects property-specific operating income and capitalization rates used to estimate the value of a future operating income stream. The operating income and the property valuations derived from capitalization rates are compared to loan payment and principal amounts to create debt service coverage ratios (\"DSCRs\") and LTVs over the forecast period. The Company's process also considers qualitative factors. The model overlays historical data about mortgage loan performance based on DSCRs and LTVs and projects the probability of default, amount of loss given a default and resulting expected loss through maturity for each loan under each economic scenario. Economic scenarios are probability-weighted based on a statistical analysis of the forecasted economic factors and qualitative analysis. The Company records the change in the ACL on mortgage loans based on the weighted-average expected credit losses across the selected economic scenarios.\nWhen a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is probable, the Company measures an ACL on individual mortgage loans. The ACL is established for any shortfall between the amortized cost of the loan and the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. Estimates of collectibility from an individual borrower require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability and timing of \nborrower default and loss severity estimates. In addition, cash flow projections may change based upon new information about the borrower's ability to pay and/or the value of underlying collateral such as changes in projected property value estimates. During the period in which all or a portion of the mortgage loan is determined to be uncollectible, the ACL is written off against the amortized cost.\nThere were \nno\n mortgage loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, \none\n office property mortgage loan with an amortized cost of $\n9\n was granted a term extension of three years at the original rate, which is a below-market rate, with a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. The modified loan represents less than \n1\n% of the mortgage loan portfolio and is current and performing in conjunction with the modified terms. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had \nno\n mortgage loans that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract or with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\nACL on Mortgage Loans\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nACL as of beginning of period\n$\n51\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n29\n \nCurrent period provision (release)\n(\n3\n)\n15\n \n7\n \nCurrent period gross write-offs\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nACL as of December 31,\n$\n44\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n36\n \nThe weighted-average LTV ratio of the Company’s mortgage loan portfolio was \n56\n% as of December 31, 2024, while the weighted-average LTV ratio at origination of these loans was \n59\n%. LTV ratios compare the loan amount to the value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan with property values based on appraisals updated no less than annually. Factors considered in estimating property values include, among other things, actual and expected property cash flows, geographic market data and the ratio of the property's net operating income to its value. DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to the borrower’s principal and interest payments and are updated no less than annually through reviews of underlying properties.\nMortgage Loans LTV & DSCR by Origination Year as of December 31, 2024\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019 & Prior\nTotal\nLoan-to-value\nAmortized Cost\nAvg.

Servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and were $\n0\n as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, because servicing fees were market-level fees at origination and remain adequate to compensate the Company for servicing the loans.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company is engaged with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs primarily as an investor through normal investment activities or, at times, as an investment manager.\nA VIE is an entity that either has investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as simple majority kick-out rights, or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. The Company performs ongoing qualitative assessments of its VIEs to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest when it has both the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the Company’s assessment, if it \n154\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 5 - Investments\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ndetermines it is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates the VIE in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated VIEs\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did \nnot\n hold any securities for which it is the primary beneficiary.\nNon-Consolidated VIEs\nThe Company, through normal investment activities, makes passive investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is limited to the total carrying value of $\n3.2\n billion and $\n3.0\n billion, respectively, which are a portion of the investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets that are primarily recorded using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $\n2.0\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion, respectively, whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management.\nFurthermore, the Company makes investments in entities that sponsor affordable housing projects. Similarly, for these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company applies the proportional amortization method to subsequently measure its investments in such qualified affordable housing projects, where costs are amortized over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized amortization of $\n2\n, $\n1\n, and $\n0\n respectively, and related tax benefits of $\n8\n, $\n1\n, and $\n0\n, respectively. The income tax credits and other income tax benefits are recognized in operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets was $\n51\n and $\n20\n as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has outstanding commitments related to affordable housing projects of $\n267\n and $\n180\n, respectively, that are contingent on various conditions precedent to funding.\nIn addition, the Company makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in ABS, CLOs, CMBS, and RMBS and are reported in fixed maturities, AFS, and FVO securities, on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its \noriginal investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company’s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the Company’s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs, and, where applicable, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company’s investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company sold $\n86\n of fixed maturities, AFS for a net realized loss of less than $\n1\n to a CLO issued by a VIE. The Company then purchased $\n24\n of fixed maturities, AFS and $\n50\n of FVO securities from the VIE issuer. These investments are valued based on unobservable inputs and are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, the Company is committed to fund an additional $\n426\n of fixed maturities, AFS in this CLO. The Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE issuer as it has no ability to direct the activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the securitization.\nReverse Repurchase Agreements, Other Collateral Transactions and Restricted Investments\nReverse Repurchase Agreements\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into reverse repurchase agreements where the Company purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same or substantially the same securities. The maturity of these transactions is generally within one year. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred to the Company under specified conditions and the Company has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities received. The Company accounts for reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company reported $\n0\n and $\n10\n, respectively, within short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets representing a receivable for the amount of cash transferred to purchase the securities.\nOther Collateral Transactions\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company pledged collateral of $\n1\n and $\n7\n, respectively, of U.S. government securities or cash primarily related to certain bank loan participations committed to through a limited partnership agreement.\nFor disclosure of collateral in support of derivative transactions, refer to the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 6 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Restricted Investments\nThe Company is required by law to deposit securities with\n \ngovernment agencies in certain states in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is required to hold fixed maturities and short-term investments in trust for the benefit of \n155\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 5 - Investments\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nsyndicate policyholders, hold fixed maturities in a Lloyd's of London (\"Lloyd's\") trust account to provide a portion of the required capital, and maintain other investments primarily consisting of overseas deposits in various countries with Lloyd's to support underwriting activities in those countries.

The remainder of investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments consists of investments in insurer-owned life insurance accounted for at cash surrender value. \nEquity method income is reported in net investment income, except amounts related to strategic investments classified in other assets which are reported in other revenues. For investments accounted for under the equity method, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2024 is limited to the total carrying value of $\n4.6\n billion. In addition, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $\n2.1\n billion to fund limited partnership investments as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in the management.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2024, aggregate investment income from investments accounted for under the equity method did not exceed \n10\n% of the Company’s before tax consolidated net income. For the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, aggregate investment income from investments accounted for under the equity method exceeded \n10\n% of the Company’s before tax consolidated net income. Accordingly, the Company is disclosing aggregated, summarized financial data for the Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method based on the most recently available information.

DERIVATIVES\nThe Company utilizes a variety of OTC, OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivative instruments as a part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions or income generation covered call transactions. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk associated with interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread, issuer default, price, and currency exchange rate or volatility. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies. \nStrategies that Qualify for Hedge Accounting\nSome of the Company's derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. Typically, these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency swaps where the terms or expected cash flows of the hedged item closely match the terms of the swap.\nCash Flow Hedges\nInterest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on variable-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps to convert the variable interest payments on the $\n500\n junior subordinated debentures due 2067 to fixed interest payments. For further information, see the Junior Subordinated Debentures section within Note 13 - Debt. \nForeign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates. \nNon-qualifying Strategies\nDerivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedges of interest rate, foreign currency, equity, and commodity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities. In addition, hedging and replication strategies that utilize credit default swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.\n The non-qualifying strategies include:\nCredit Contracts\nCredit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in \nexchange for compensation from the counterparty or the Company should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. The Company also enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.\nInterest Rate Swaps and Futures\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, futures to manage interest rate duration between assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $\n344\n and $\n6.6\n billion, respectively.\nForeign Currency Swaps and Forwards\nThe Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity investments to U.S. dollars. \nEquity Index Options\nThe Company enters into equity index options to hedge the impact of a decline in the equity markets on the investment portfolio.\nCommodity Options\nThe Company previously purchased call option contracts on oil futures in order to partially offset potential changes in value related to certain fixed maturity securities that could arise if oil prices increased substantially.\nDerivative Balance Sheet Classification\nFor reporting purposes, the Company has elected to offset within assets or liabilities based upon the net of the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.\n The following fair value amounts do not include income accruals or related cash collateral receivables and payables, which are netted with derivative fair value amounts to determine balance sheet presentation. The Company’s derivative instruments are held for risk management purposes, unless otherwise noted in the following table. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and is presented in the table to quantify the volume of the Company’s derivative activity. Notional amounts are not necessarily reflective of credit risk.\n157\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 6 - Derivatives\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nDerivative Balance Sheet Presentation\n \nNet Derivatives\nAsset Derivatives \nLiability Derivatives \n \nNotional Amount\nFair Value\nFair Value\nFair Value\nHedge Designation/ Derivative Type\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nCash flow hedges\nInterest rate swaps\n$\n4,225\n \n$\n3,450\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n2\n)\nForeign currency swaps\n646\n \n644\n \n41\n \n13\n \n52\n \n29\n \n(\n11\n)\n(\n16\n)\nTotal cash flow hedges\n4,871\n \n4,094\n \n41\n \n12\n \n52\n \n30\n \n(\n11\n)\n(\n18\n)\nNon-qualifying strategies\nInterest rate contracts\nInterest rate swaps and futures\n344\n \n6,626\n \n—\n \n(\n5\n)\n1\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\nForeign exchange contracts\nForeign currency swaps and forwards\n647\n \n645\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCredit contracts\nCredit derivatives in offsetting positions\n986\n \n998\n \n—\n \n—\n \n31\n \n27\n \n(\n31\n)\n(\n27\n)\nEquity contracts\nEquity index options\n233\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal non-qualifying strategies\n2,210\n \n8,269\n \n4\n \n(\n5\n)\n36\n \n27\n \n(\n32\n)\n(\n32\n)\nTotal cash flow hedges and non-qualifying strategies\n$\n7,081\n \n$\n12,363\n \n$\n45\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n88\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n(\n43\n)\n$\n(\n50\n)\nBalance Sheet Location\nFixed maturities, AFS\n$\n647\n \n$\n645\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nOther investments\n3,011\n \n1,662\n \n57\n \n(\n1\n)\n66\n \n18\n \n(\n9\n)\n(\n19\n)\nOther liabilities\n3,423\n \n10,056\n \n(\n12\n)\n8\n \n22\n \n39\n \n(\n34\n)\n(\n31\n)\nTotal derivatives\n$\n7,081\n \n$\n12,363\n \n$\n45\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n88\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n(\n43\n)\n$\n(\n50\n)\n.\n158\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 6 - Derivatives\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nOffsetting of Derivative Assets/Liabilities\nThe following tables present the gross fair value amounts, the amounts offset, and net position of derivative instruments eligible for offset in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities and long-term debt that will occur over the next twelve months. Over that time, the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an adjustment to net investment income or interest expense, as applicable, over the term of the hedged instrument cash flows.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company had \nno\n net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings \nresulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.\nNon-qualifying Strategies\nFor non-qualifying strategies, including embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from their host contracts and accounted for as derivatives, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings within net realized gains (losses).\nNon-Qualifying Strategies Recognized within Net Realized Gains (Losses)\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nForeign exchange contracts\nForeign currency swaps and forwards\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \nInterest rate contracts\nInterest rate swaps and futures\n8\n \n(\n3\n)\n25\n \nCredit contracts\nCredit derivatives that purchase credit protection\n—\n \n(\n105\n)\n4\n \nEquity contracts\nEquity index options\n5\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\nCommodity contracts\nCommodity options\n—\n \n—\n \n14\n \nTotal [1]\n$\n13\n \n$\n(\n108\n)\n$\n46\n \n[1]\nExcludes investments that contain an embedded credit derivative for which the Company has elected the fair value option.

The Company will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will only make a payment if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be \nequal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security issuer’s debt obligation after the occurrence of the credit event. A credit event is generally defined as a default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The credit default swaps in which the Company assumes credit risk may reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include standard diversified portfolios of corporate and CMBS issuers. \n160\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 6 - Derivatives\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nCredit Risk Assumed Derivatives by Type\nUnderlying Referenced Credit Obligation(s) [1]\nNotional Amount [2]\nFair Value\nWeighted Average Years to Maturity\nType\nAverage Credit Rating\nOffsetting Notional Amount [3]\nOffsetting Fair Value [3]\nAs of December 31, 2024\nBasket credit default swaps [4]\nInvestment grade risk exposure\n$\n100\n \n$\n—\n \n4\n years\nCMBS Credit\nAAA\n$\n100\n \n$\n—\n \nBelow investment grade risk exposure\n392\n \n30\n \n3\n years\nCorporate Credit\nB+\n392\n \n(\n30\n)\nBelow investment grade risk exposure\n1\n \n(\n1\n)\nLess than 1 year\nCMBS Credit\nCCC\n1\n \n1\n \nTotal [5]\n$\n493\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n493\n \n$\n(\n29\n)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nBasket credit default swaps [4]\nInvestment grade risk exposure\n$\n101\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n5\n years\nCMBS Credit\nAAA\n$\n101\n \n$\n1\n \nBelow investment grade risk exposure\n396\n \n24\n \n4\n years\nCorporate Credit\nB+\n396\n \n(\n24\n)\nBelow investment grade risk exposure\n2\n \n(\n1\n)\nLess than 1 year\nCMBS Credit\nCCC-\n2\n \n1\n \nTotal [5]\n$\n499\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n499\n \n$\n(\n22\n)\n[1]\nThe average credit ratings are based on availability and are generally the midpoint of the available ratings among Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has pledged cash collateral associated with derivative instruments of $\n31\n and $\n25\n, respectively. In general, collateral receivable is recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as determined by the Company's election to offset on the balance sheet.

For these balances, the ACL is estimated based on an aging of receivables and recent historical credit loss and collection experience, adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when appropriate. Balances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods.\nA portion of the Company's Business Insurance business is written with large deductibles or under retrospectively-rated plans (referred to as \"loss sensitive business\"). Under some commercial insurance contracts with a large deductible, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim and the Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. As such, the Company is subject to credit risk until reimbursement is made. Retrospectively-rated policies are utilized primarily for workers' compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is adjusted based on actual losses incurred. Although the premium adjustment feature of a retrospectively-rated policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it presents credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such policyholders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the amount of additional premium owed under retrospectively-rated policies. The Company manages these credit risks through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and oversight.\nThe ACL for receivables for loss sensitive business is estimated as the amount of the receivable exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned based on each policyholder's credit rating, or a rating is estimated if no external rating is available. Credit ratings are reviewed and updated at least annually. The exposure amount is estimated net of collateral and other credit enhancement, considering the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, and historical loss information for the type of collateral obtained. The probability of default factors are historical corporate defaults for receivables with similar durations estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. The loss given default factors are based on a study of historical recovery rates for general creditors through multiple economic cycles. The Company's evaluation of the required ACL for receivables for loss sensitive business considers the current economic environment as well as the probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used for estimating the ACL for mortgage loans.

REINSURANCE \nThe Company cedes insurance risk to reinsurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company's procedures include carefully selecting its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where necessary, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers. \nThe Company has two ADC reinsurance agreements in place, both of which are accounted for as retroactive reinsurance and have exhausted their treaty limit. One agreement covered substantially all A&E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years (\"A&E ADC\") up to an aggregate limit of $\n1.5\n billion and the other covered substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance Company (\"NIC\") and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years (the \"Navigators ADC\") up to an aggregate limit of $\n300\n. As the Company has ceded all of the $\n300\n and $\n1.5\n billion available limits under the Navigators ADC and the A&E ADC, respectively, there is \nno\n remaining limit available under either agreement as of December 31, 2024. For more information on ADC agreements, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. \nProperty and Casualty ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $\n1,241\n, $\n1,043\n and \n$\n1,338\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEmployee Benefits ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $\n120\n, $\n93\n and $\n81\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nReinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with those used in establishing the gross reserves for amounts the Company owes to its claimants. The Company estimates its ceded reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how IBNR unpaid losses will ultimately be ceded under reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nReinsurance Recoverables by Credit Quality Indicator\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\nP&C\nEmployee Benefits \nCorporate\nTotal\nP&C\nEmployee Benefits \nCorporate\nTotal\nAM Best Financial Strength Rating\nA++\n$\n2,271\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,271\n \n$\n2,398\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,398\n \nA+\n2,169\n \n281\n \n224\n \n2,674\n \n2,030\n \n251\n \n241\n \n2,522\n \nA\n829\n \n1\n \n—\n \n830\n \n810\n \n1\n \n—\n \n811\n \nA-\n622\n \n4\n \n—\n \n626\n \n653\n \n5\n \n—\n \n658\n \nB++\n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n4\n \n2\n \n—\n \n3\n \n5\n \nBelow B++\n22\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22\n \n22\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22\n \nTotal Rated by AM Best\n5,915\n \n286\n \n226\n \n6,427\n \n5,915\n \n257\n \n244\n \n6,416\n \nMandatory (Assigned) and Voluntary Risk Pools\n205\n \n—\n \n—\n \n205\n \n208\n \n—\n \n—\n \n208\n \nCaptives\n402\n \n—\n \n—\n \n402\n \n353\n \n—\n \n—\n \n353\n \nOther not rated companies\n176\n \n5\n \n—\n \n181\n \n226\n \n4\n \n—\n \n230\n \nGross Reinsurance Recoverables\n6,698\n \n291\n \n226\n \n7,215\n \n6,702\n \n261\n \n244\n \n7,207\n \nAllowance for uncollectible reinsurance\n(\n72\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n75\n)\n(\n100\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n103\n)\nNet Reinsurance Recoverables\n$\n6,626\n \n$\n290\n \n$\n224\n \n$\n7,140\n \n$\n6,602\n \n$\n260\n \n$\n242\n \n$\n7,104\n \nBalances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods, generally 30, 60 or 90 days. To manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. In placing \nreinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.\nWhere its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral or other credit enhancement, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured \n163\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 8 - Reinsurance\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ntrusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.\nThe allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. The ACL is estimated as the amount of reinsurance recoverables exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for the probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned based on each reinsurer's credit rating, or a rating is estimated if no external rating is available. Credit ratings are reviewed on a quarterly basis and any significant changes are reflected in an updated estimate. The probability of default factors are historical insurer and reinsurer defaults for liabilities with similar durations to the reinsured liabilities as estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. The loss given default factors are based on a study of historical recovery rates for general creditors of corporations through multiple \neconomic cycles or, in the case of purchased annuities funding structured settlements accounted for as reinsurance, historical recovery rates for annuity contract holders.\nAs shown in the table above, a portion of the total gross reinsurance recoverable balance relates to the Company’s participation in various mandatory (assigned) and voluntary risk pools. Reinsurance recoverables due from pools are backed by the financial position of all insurance companies participating in the pools and the credit backing the reinsurance recoverable is not limited to the financial strength of each pool. The mandatory pools generally are funded through policy assessments or surcharges and if any participant in the pool defaults, remaining liabilities are apportioned among the other members.\nThe Company's evaluation of the required ACL for reinsurance recoverables considers the current economic environment as well as macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used to estimate the ACL for mortgage loans. See Note 5 - Investments. Insurance companies, including reinsurers, are regulated and hold risk-based capital (\"RBC\") to mitigate the risk of loss due to economic factors and other risks. Non-U.S. reinsurers are either subject to a capital regime substantively equivalent to domestic insurers or we hold collateral to support collection of reinsurance recoverables. As a result, there is limited history of losses from insurer defaults. In 2024, the ACL was reduced due to a decrease in a previously established reserve for an A&E reinsurer that entered liquidation proceedings.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Reinsurance\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAs of December 31, 2022\nP&C beginning allowance for uncollectible reinsurance\n$\n100\n \n$\n102\n \n$\n96\n \nBeginning allowance for disputed amounts\n57\n \n60\n \n54\n \nP&C beginning ACL\n43\n \n42\n \n42\n \nCurrent period provision\n(\n6\n)\n3\n \n—\n \nCurrent period gross write-offs\n(\n13\n)\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \nP&C ending ACL\n24\n \n43\n \n42\n \nEnding allowance for disputed amounts\n48\n \n57\n \n60\n \nP&C ending allowance for uncollectible reinsurance\n72\n \n100\n \n102\n \nEmployee Benefits allowance for uncollectible reinsurance\n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \nCorporate allowance for uncollectible reinsurance\n2\n \n2\n \n2\n \nTotal allowance for uncollectible reinsurance\n$\n75\n \n$\n103\n \n$\n105\n \n164\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 8 - Reinsurance\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nInsurance Revenues\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Revenue\n \nFor the years ended December 31,\nPremiums Written\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDirect\n$\n17,622\n \n$\n16,144\n \n$\n14,891\n \nAssumed\n1,102\n \n975\n \n718\n \nCeded\n(\n1,775\n)\n(\n1,642\n)\n(\n1,490\n)\nNet\n$\n16,949\n \n$\n15,477\n \n$\n14,119\n \nPremiums Earned\n \n \n \nDirect\n$\n16,915\n \n$\n15,514\n \n$\n14,328\n \nAssumed\n1,001\n \n826\n \n654\n \nCeded\n(\n1,742\n)\n(\n1,612\n)\n(\n1,462\n)\nNet\n$\n16,174\n \n$\n14,728\n \n$\n13,520\n \nEmployee Benefits Revenue \n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nGross earned premiums, fees and other considerations\n$\n6,576\n \n$\n6,445\n \n$\n5,988\n \nReinsurance assumed\n166\n \n174\n \n175\n \nReinsurance ceded\n(\n127\n)\n(\n104\n)\n(\n106\n)\nNet earned premiums, fees and other considerations\n$\n6,615\n \n$\n6,515\n \n$\n6,057\n \nFor its Employee Benefits products, the Company reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements and variations thereto.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in the ultimate settlement of the liabilities gross of reinsurance include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures before reinsurance, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in gross reserves include expanding theories of liabilities and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.\n(Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWorkers’ compensation\n$\n(\n258\n)\n$\n(\n236\n)\n$\n(\n204\n)\nWorkers’ compensation discount accretion\n44\n \n42\n \n36\n \nGeneral liability\n211\n \n41\n \n56\n \nMarine\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n2\n \nPackage business\n(\n6\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n39\n)\nCommercial property\n(\n7\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n11\n)\nProfessional liability\n(\n27\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n11\n)\nBond\n(\n56\n)\n(\n27\n)\n(\n32\n)\nAssumed reinsurance\n24\n \n34\n \n19\n \nCommercial automobile liability\n47\n \n20\n \n38\n \nPersonal automobile liability\n(\n30\n)\n—\n \n(\n14\n)\nHomeowners\n(\n28\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n1\n)\nNet asbestos and environmental reserves\n141\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCatastrophes\n(\n87\n)\n(\n87\n)\n(\n62\n)\nUncollectible reinsurance\n(\n19\n)\n13\n \n3\n \nOther reserve re-estimates, net \n15\n \n57\n \n27\n \nPrior accident year development, including full \nbenefit for the ADC cession\n(\n37\n)\n(\n184\n)\n(\n193\n)\nChange in deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance included in other liabilities [1]\n(\n83\n)\n194\n \n229\n \nTotal prior accident year development\n$\n(\n120\n)\n$\n10\n \n$\n36\n \n[1] The change in deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance for the year ended December 31, 2024, included a benefit for amortization of the Navigators ADC deferred gain of $\n145\n.

In exchange for its payment, the Company receives a complete release of its policies issued to BSA and the Local Councils, as \nwell as an injunction against further abuse claims involving BSA. All conditions precedent to the Settlement have been satisfied, including approval by the bankruptcy court and the district court, and on April 20, 2023, The Hartford paid the Settlement amount of $\n787\n. Certain objecting parties have appealed the district court’s ruling and that appeal is pending before the Third Circuit. If the court approvals for the BSA’s plan of reorganization are not affirmed on appeal, it is possible that adverse outcomes, if any, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.\nAdverse Development Covers\nThe Company has an adverse development cover reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reinsure loss development after 2016 on substantially all of the Company’s asbestos and environmental reserves (the “A&E ADC”). Under the A&E ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $\n650\n for NICO to assume adverse net loss reserve development up to $\n1.5\n billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $\n1.7\n billion including reserves for A&E exposure for accident years prior to 1986 that are reported in Property & Casualty Other Operations (\"Run-off A&E\") and reserves for A&E exposure for accident years 1986 and subsequent from policies underwritten prior to 2016 that are reported in ongoing Business Insurance and Personal Insurance. The $\n650\n reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The A&E ADC covered substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.\nUnder retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 results in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $\n1.5\n billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $\n650\n reinsurance premium paid have been recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $\n650\n reinsurance premium paid result in a deferred gain. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has incurred $\n1.5\n billion in cumulative adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO with \nno\n available limit remaining. As such, \nno\n remaining coverage is available for any future adverse net reserve development, which may be significant. The Company has recorded a $\n850\n deferred gain within other liabilities, representing the difference between the reinsurance recoverable of $\n1.5\n billion and ceded premium paid of $\n650\n. \nRecoveries from NICO will be collected once the Company has paid cumulative losses in excess of the $\n1.7\n billion attachment point. T\nhe deferred gain will be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries.\nImmediately after closing on the acquisition of Navigators Group, effective May 23, 2019, the Company purchased the Navigators ADC, an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering adverse reserve development, from NICO on behalf of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its \n170\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\naffiliates (collectively, “Navigators Insurers\"). Under the Navigators ADC, the Navigators Insurers paid NICO a reinsurance premium of $\n91\n in exchange for reinsurance coverage of $\n300\n of adverse net loss reserve development that attaches $\n100\n above the Navigators Insurers' existing net loss and allocated loss adjustment reserves as of December 31, 2018 subject to the treaty of $\n1.816\n billion for accidents and losses prior to December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has recorded a reinsurance recoverable under the Navigators ADC of $\n91\n as estimated cumulative loss development on the 2018 and prior accident year reserves has exhausted the treaty limit. While the reinsurance recoverable is $\n91\n, the Company previously \nrecorded a $\n209\n cumulative deferred gain within other liabilities since, under retroactive reinsurance accounting, ceded losses in excess of the $\n91\n of ceded premium paid must be recognized as a deferred gain. During 2024, the Company collected recoveries from NICO under the Navigators ADC and as a result amortized $\n145\n of the $\n209\n deferred gain within benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As there were \nno\n collected recoveries during the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, there were \nno\n changes to the deferred gain in those years. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the deferred gain on the Navigators ADC was $\n64\n and $\n209\n, respectively, and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nReconciliation of Loss Development to Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses As of December 31, 2024 \nLosses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nSubtotal\nReserve Line\nCumulative Incurred for Accident Years Displayed in Triangles\nCumulative Paid for Accident Years Displayed in Triangles\nUnpaid for Accident Years not Displayed in Triangles\nUnpaid Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nDiscount\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nReinsurance and Other Recoverables\nLiability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nWorkers' compensation\n$\n18,389\n \n$\n(\n9,665\n)\n$\n3,836\n \n$\n419\n \n$\n(\n319\n)\n$\n12,660\n \n$\n1,721\n \n$\n14,381\n \nGeneral liability\n9,416\n \n(\n4,177\n)\n494\n \n202\n \n—\n \n5,935\n \n1,230\n \n7,165\n \nMarine\n1,427\n \n(\n1,114\n)\n15\n \n15\n \n—\n \n343\n \n244\n \n587\n \nPackage business\n8,630\n \n(\n6,279\n)\n109\n \n130\n \n—\n \n2,590\n \n31\n \n2,621\n \nCommercial property\n4,244\n \n(\n3,676\n)\n13\n \n31\n \n—\n \n612\n \n299\n \n911\n \nCommercial automobile liability\n4,606\n \n(\n3,106\n)\n16\n \n38\n \n—\n \n1,554\n \n113\n \n1,667\n \nCommercial automobile physical damage\n239\n \n(\n213\n)\n4\n \n1\n \n—\n \n31\n \n—\n \n31\n \nProfessional liability\n3,042\n \n(\n1,567\n)\n55\n \n47\n \n—\n \n1,577\n \n611\n \n2,188\n \nBond\n667\n \n(\n276\n)\n19\n \n33\n \n—\n \n443\n \n14\n \n457\n \nAssumed Reinsurance\n2,107\n \n(\n1,356\n)\n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n758\n \n30\n \n788\n \nPersonal automobile liability\n10,862\n \n(\n9,240\n)\n31\n \n74\n \n—\n \n1,727\n \n18\n \n1,745\n \nPersonal automobile physical damage\n1,640\n \n(\n1,574\n)\n7\n \n5\n \n—\n \n78\n \n—\n \n78\n \nHomeowners\n5,876\n \n(\n5,521\n)\n6\n \n42\n \n—\n \n403\n \n5\n \n408\n \nOther ongoing business\n168\n \n7\n \n(\n14\n)\n161\n \n356\n \n517\n \nAsbestos and environmental [1]\n315\n \n—\n \n—\n \n315\n \n2,038\n \n2,353\n \nOther operations [1]\n293\n \n171\n \n—\n \n464\n \n43\n \n507\n \nTotal P&C\n$\n71,145\n \n$\n(\n47,764\n)\n$\n5,381\n \n$\n1,222\n \n$\n(\n333\n)\n$\n29,651\n \n$\n6,753\n \n$\n36,404\n \n[1]\nAsbestos and environmental and other operations include asbestos, environmental and other latent exposures not foreseen when coverages were written, including, but not limited to, potential liability for pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries, lead paint, construction defects, sexual molestation and sexual abuse and other long-tail liabilities.

These reserve lines differ from the reserve lines reported on a statutory basis, as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). The cumulative incurred losses displayed in the above table include the full reinsurance benefit of ceding $\n300\n of losses to the Navigators ADC even though $\n64\n of that benefit has been recorded as a deferred gain within other liabilities. The $\n300\n of Navigators Insurers losses ceded to the Navigators ADC and reflected in the following triangles include $\n95\n for professional liability, $\n105\n for general liability, $\n38\n for marine, $\n27\n for assumed reinsurance, $\n14\n for commercial automobile, $\n3\n for commercial property, and $\n1\n for bond. The triangles do not include $\n17\n of losses ceded to the Navigators ADC related to older accident years and lines of business not in the triangles.\nThe following loss triangles present historical loss development for incurred and paid claims by accident year, including loss development on Navigators Insurers reserves prior to and after the May 23, 2019 acquisition date. Because the loss triangles include pre-acquisition date changes in ultimate incurred loss estimates for Navigators Insurers’ reserves, changes in reserve development evident in the incurred loss triangles may differ from prior accident year development (\"PYD\")  recorded by the Company as shown in the (Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development table above as that only includes changes in Navigators Insurers’ reserves post acquisition. In addition, the incurred loss triangles include reserve development on both catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims whereas the (Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development table above shows the total amount of catastrophe reserve development across all lines of business on a single line.\nTriangles are limited to the number of years for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding, not exceeding ten years. Short-tail lines, which represent claims generally expected to be paid within a few years, have three years of claim development displayed.

IBNR represents the excess of estimated ultimate loss reserves over case reserves. The process to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses is an integral part of the Company's reserve setting. Reserves for ALAE and ULAE are generally established separate from the reserves for losses.\nReserves for losses are set by line of business within the reportable segments. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge \nmore quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and automobile physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.\nThe Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. The \n185\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nreserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. \nFor both short-tail and long-tail lines of business, an expected loss ratio (\"ELR\") is used to record initial reserves. This ELR is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year (\"CAY\") gives weight to both the initial ELR multiplied by earned premium approach as well as a loss development approach, given early reported losses are more credible than in long-tailed lines. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the ELR for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period. For certain short-tailed lines of business, including commercial property, homeowners, and automobile physical damage, IBNR amounts in the above loss development triangles are negative in certain accident years due to anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid losses.\nAs losses for a given accident year emerge or develop in subsequent periods, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the ELR method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the ELR and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more weight vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to as actuarial indications.\nPaid development and reported development techniques are used for most lines of business though more weight is given to the reported development method for some of the long-tailed lines like general liability. In addition, for long-tailed lines of business, the Company relies on the ELR method for immature accident years. Frequency/severity techniques are used predominantly for professional liability and are also used for automobile liability. The Berquist-Sherman technique is also \nused for automobile liability, marine and assumed reinsurance. For most lines, reserves for ALAE, or those expenses related to specific claims, are analyzed using paid development techniques and an analysis of the relationship between ALAE and loss payments. For most of the lines acquired through the Navigators Group book of business, loss and ALAE are reviewed on a combined basis. Reserves for ULAE are determined using the expected cost per claim year and the anticipated claim closure pattern as well as the ratio of paid ULAE to paid losses.\nThe recorded reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the Company's best estimate of the ultimate settlement amount of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. In applying judgment, the best estimate is selected after considering the estimates derived from a number of actuarial methods, giving more weight to those methods deemed more predictive of ultimate unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The Company does not produce a statistical range or confidence interval of reserve estimates and, since reserving methods with more credibility are given greater weight, the selected best estimate may differ from the mid-point of the various estimates produced by the actuarial methods used. \nCumulative number of reported claims \nFor most property and casualty lines, claim counts represent the number of claim features on a reported claim where a claim feature is each separate coverage for each claimant affected by the claim event. For example, one car accident that results in two bodily injury claims and one automobile damage liability claim would be counted as three claims within the personal automobile liability triangle. Similarly, a fire that impacts one commercial building may result in multiple claim features due to the potential for claims related to business interruption, structural damage, and loss of the physical contents of the building. Claim features that result in no paid losses are included in the reported claim counts. For some property and casualty lines, such as marine and assumed reinsurance, a claim count represents each reported claim regardless of the number of features. For assumed bordereau business and business written on binders, one claim count is posted for each bordereau received, which could account for multiple claims. \n186\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 10 -

A Disabled Life Reserve (\"DLR\") is calculated for each LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all estimated future benefit payments and includes estimates of claim recovery, investment yield, and offsets from other income, including offsets from Social Security benefits and workers’ compensation. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. The DLR also includes a liability for payments to claimants who have not yet been approved for LTD. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience. For claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability. In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR.\nFor incurral years with IBNR claims, estimates of ultimate losses are made by applying completion factors to the dollar amount of claims reported or expected depending on the market segment. IBNR represents estimated ultimate losses less both DLR and cumulative paid amounts for all reported claims. Completion factors are derived using standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The IBNR includes an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.\n190\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFor all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and market segment, where emerged claim information for an incurral year is not yet credible enough to be a basis for an IBNR projection. In these cases, the ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio.\nThe Company also records reserves for future death benefits under group term life policies that provide for premiums to be waived in the event the insured is unable to work due to disability and has satisfied an elimination period, which is typically nine months (premium waiver reserves). The death benefit reserve for these group life premium waiver claims is estimated for a known disabled claimant equal to the present value of expected future cash outflows (typically a lump sum face amount payable at death plus claim expenses) with separate estimates for claimant recovery (when no death benefit is payable) and for death before recovery or benefit expiry (when death benefit is payable). The IBNR for premium waiver death benefits is estimated with standard actuarial development methods.\nIn addition, the Company also records reserves for group term life, accidental loss of life and severe injury, short-term disability, and other group products that have short claim payout periods. For these products, reserves are determined using paid or reported actuarial development methods. The resulting claim triangles produce a completion pattern and estimate of ultimate loss.

The effective interest rate on the remaining notes does not differ materially from the stated rate.\nShelf Registrations\nOn September 23, 2024, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-282288) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, guarantees, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, \nwarrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. Because The Hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the registration statement became effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the \nthree-year\n life of the registration statement.\nJunior Subordinated Debentures\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has outstanding $\n500\n of callable junior subordinated debentures with a final maturity on February 12, 2067. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a variable rate that resets quarterly.\nThe $\n500\n junior subordinated debentures due 2067 are unsecured, subordinated and junior in right of payment and upon liquidation to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. In addition, the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including obligations to policyholders. The debentures do not limit the Company’s or the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, including debt that ranks senior in right of payment and upon liquidation to the debentures.\nThe Company has the right to defer interest payments for up to a consecutive ten years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will continue to accrue and will accrue additional interest at the then applicable interest rate. If the Company defers interest payments, the Company generally may not make payments on or redeem or purchase any shares of its capital stock or any of its debt securities or guarantees that rank upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up equally with or junior to the debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.\n \nThe Company may elect to redeem the $\n500\n junior subordinated debentures due 2067 in whole or in part for the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.\nIn connection with the offering of this debenture, the Company entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant (\"RCC\") for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company's indebtedness, initially the Company's 4.3% notes due 2043. Under the terms of the RCC, if the Company redeems the debenture any time prior to February 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms) it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. \n194\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 13 - Debt\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nLong-Term Debt\nLong-term Debt Maturities (at par value) as of December 31, 2024\n2024 - Current maturities\n$\n—\n \n2026\n$\n—\n \n2027\n$\n—\n \n2028\n$\n—\n \n2029\n$\n600\n \nThereafter\n$\n3,882\n \nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Hartford has a $\n750\n senior unsecured revolving credit facility, including $\n100\n available to support letters of credit (the \"Credit Facility\"), \nwith an expiration date of October 27, 2026. Under the Credit Facility: \n•\nRevolving loans may be in multiple currencies. \n•\nU.S. dollar loans will bear interest at a floating rate equivalent to an indexed rate that varies depending on the type of borrowing plus a basis point spread based on The Hartford's credit rating and will mature no later than October 27, 2026.\n \n•\nLetters of credit bear a fee based on The Hartford's credit rating and expire no later than October 27, 2027\n. \nThe Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth financial covenant to $11.25 billion, excluding AOCI, limits the ratio of senior debt to capitalization, excluding AOCI, at 35% and includes other customary covenants.\n The Credit Facility is for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nno\n borrowings were outstanding, \nno\n letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and the Company was \nin compliance\n with all financial covenants.\nLloyd's Letter of Credit Facility\nThe Hartford has a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the\"Lloyd's Facility\"). On October 21, 2024, The Hartford amended and restated the Lloyd's Facility. The purpose of this facility is to issue letters of credit that may be treated as Funds at Lloyd's to support underwriting capacity provided by The Hartford Corporate Underwriters Limited to the Lloyd's syndicate 1221 for the 2025 and 2026 underwriting years of account (and prior open years). The amended and restated Lloyd's Facility has two tranches, with one tranche extending a $\n74\n commitment and the other tranche extending a £\n79\n million ($\n99\n as December 31, 2024). The term of the facility is two years. As of December 31, 2024, letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $\n74\n and £\n79\n million, or $\n99\n, were outstanding under the Lloyd's Facility. As of December 31, 2023, letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $\n74\n and £\n79\n million, or $\n101\n, were outstanding under the Lloyd's Facility. \nAmong other covenants, the Lloyd's Facility contains financial covenants regarding The Hartford’s consolidated net worth and \nfinancial leverage. As of December 31, 2024, The Hartford was in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility.\nCollateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston\nThe Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (\"HLA\"), are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (\"FHLBB\"). Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or variable rates. FHLBB membership required the purchase of member stock and requires additional member stock ownership of 3% or 4% of any amount borrowed. The amount of advances that can be taken is limited to a percentage of the fair value of the assets considered eligible collateral, for example, 96% for U.S. government-backed fixed maturities maturing within 3 years and 75% for AA-rated commercial mortgage-backed fixed maturities maturing in 5 years or more. In its consolidated balance sheets, The Hartford presents the liability for advances taken based on use of the funds with advances for general corporate purposes presented in short- or long-term debt and advances to earn incremental investment income presented in other liabilities, consistent with other collateralized financing transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements. The Connecticut Department of Insurance permits Hartford Fire and HLA to pledge up to $\n1.4\n billion and $\n0.6\n billion in qualifying assets, respectively, without prior approval, to secure FHLBB advances in 2024. The pledge limit is determined quarterly based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus of Hartford Fire and HLA, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \nno\n advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.\n195\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 14 - Commitments and Contingencies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nManagement evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes liabilities for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated liability at the low end of the range of losses.\nLitigation\nThe Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties related to sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims, including those discussed in Note 10, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, and in the following discussion under the caption “Run-off Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.\nThe Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. In addition to the matter described below, these actions include putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper sales or underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile and property. The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims or other allegedly unfair or improper business practices. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, the outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nRun-off Asbestos and Environmental Claims\nThe Company continues to receive A&E claims. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs. \nThe vast majority of the Company's exposure to A&E relates to accident years prior to 1986 that are reported in Property & Casualty Other Operations (\"Run-off A&E\"). In addition, since 1986, the Company has written asbestos and environmental exposures under general liability policies and pollution liability under homeowners policies, which are reported in the Business Insurance and Personal Insurance segments, respectively. \nPrior to 1986, the Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover A&E claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess and umbrella policies providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing primary, excess, umbrella and reinsurance coverages. \nSignificant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid gross losses and expenses related to environmental and asbestos claims. The degree of variability of gross reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures.\nIn the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent and emerging legal doctrines with respect to the underlying claims and with respect to the Company's coverage obligations. Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers, insolvencies of insureds and unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for A&E claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.\nIn the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages against insureds, emerging risks from products and substances alleged to cause damage, such as per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\"), the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent and emerging legal doctrines concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and the scope and level of complexity of the remediation required by regulators.\nThe reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to A&E claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or years to determine \n 196\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 14 - Commitments and Contingencies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nthat the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.\nIt is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of A&E claims.\nGiven the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for A&E exposures. For this reason, the Company principally relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims, both gross and net of reinsurance, and regularly evaluates new account information in assessing its potential A&E exposures. The Company supplements this exposure-based analysis with evaluations of the Company’s historical direct net loss and expense paid and reported experience, and net loss and expense paid and reported experience by calendar and/or report year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity.\nFor its Run-off A&E claims, a\ns of December 31, 2024, the Company reported $\n224\n of net asbestos and environmental reserves, including the benefit of losses ceded to the A&E ADC with NICO. In addition, the Company has recorded $\n850\n, including $\n62\n in 2024, of a deferred gain within other liabilities for losses economically ceded to NICO but for which the benefit is not recognized in earnings until later periods. While the Company believes that its current Run-off A&E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit our ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not reasonably estimable now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results or liquidity.\nThe Company’s A&E ADC reinsurance agreement reinsures substantially all A&E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years, including Run-off A&E and A&E reserves included in Business Insurance and Personal Insurance. The A&E ADC has a coverage limit of $\n1.5\n billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $\n1.7\n billion. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has incurred $\n1.5\n billion in cumulative adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty, leaving \nno\n remaining coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any. Cumulative adverse development of A&E claims for accident years 2016 and prior in excess of the treaty limit, including $\n141\n recognized in 2024, are absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. The effect of future charges could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results or liquidity. For more information on the A&E ADC, refer to Note 10, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\n. \nUnfunded Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $\n3.8\n billion, of which $\n2.1\n billion is committed to fund limited partnerships and other alternative investments, which may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. The funding of purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments are at the discretion of the general partner or manager and may be called at any time. Additionally, $\n1.0\n billion of the outstanding commitments relate to various funding obligations associated with private debt and equity securities, as well as tax credits. The remaining outstanding commitments of $\n636\n relate to mortgage loans. Of the $\n3.8\n billion in total outstanding commitments, $\n53\n are related to mortgage loan commitments which the Company can cancel unconditionally.\nGuaranty Funds and Other Insurance-related Assessments\nIn all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state, a guaranty fund may assess its members to pay covered claims of the insolvent insurers. Assessments are based on each member's proportionate share of written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to \none\n or \ntwo\n percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets, while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process.\nLiabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the liability balance was $\n70\n and $\n77\n, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were $\n0\n of premium tax offsets related to guaranty fund or other insurance-related assessments for both periods. \nDerivative Commitments\nCertain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could, in certain instances, terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. \n197\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 14 - Commitments and Contingencies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2024 was $\n33\n for which the legal entities have posted collateral of $\n31\n in the normal course of business. Based on derivative contractual terms as of December 31, 2024, a downgrade of the current financial strength ratings by either Moody's or S&P would \nno\nt require additional assets to be posted as collateral. This requirement could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the additional collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.\nGuarantees\nIn the ordinary course of selling businesses or entities to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising subsequent to the closing due to breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business or entity being sold or with respect to covenants and obligations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. The Company does not expect to make any material payments on these guarantees and is not carrying any material liabilities associated with these guarantees.\nThe Hartford has guaranteed the timely payment of contractual claims under certain life, accident and health and annuity \ncontracts issued by its former life and annuity business with most of the guaranteed contracts issued between 1990 and 1997 (the \"Talcott Guarantees\"). Upon the sale of the life and annuity business in May 2018, the purchaser indemnified the Company for any liability arising under the guarantees. The Talcott Guarantees cover contractual obligations only but otherwise have no limitation as to maximum potential future payments.\nThe liability for credit losses (\"LCL\") for Talcott Guarantees is calculated for the estimated amount payable under guaranteed contracts multiplied by the probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned by credit rating of the applicable insurance company that issued the contract and is based on historical insurance industry defaults for liabilities with similar durations estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are current and forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. Because annuities represent the majority of the contracts issued, the loss given default factors are based on a historical study of annuity policyholder recoveries from insolvent estate assets. The Company's exposure is expected to run off over a period that will include more than one economic cycle.\nThe Company's evaluation of the required LCL for the Talcott Guarantees considers the current economic environment as well as macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used to estimate the ACL for mortgage loans. See Note 5 - Investments. In 2022, the LCL decreased from $\n25\n to $\n22\n primarily reflecting a decrease in the estimated amount payable under guaranteed contracts. In 2023, the LCL decreased to $\n9\n primarily due to an upgrade of Talcott's credit rating, as well as a decrease in the estimated amount payable under guaranteed contracts. During 2024, the LCL decreased to $\n7\n primarily due to an improvement of Talcott's assumed liquidation rate, as well as a decrease in the estimated amount payable under guaranteed contracts. The Company has never experienced a loss on financial guarantees similar to the Talcott Guarantees and we believe the risk of loss is remote.\n15. EQUITY \nEquity Repurchase Program\nIn July, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization for up to $\n3.3\n billion effective from August 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has $\n3.15\n billion remaining for equity repurchases under this share repurchase program.\nThe Hartford's $\n3.0\n billion equity repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors in August 2022, expired on December 31, 2024. The Hartford's previous $\n3.0\n billion equity repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors in December 2020 expired on December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 the Company repurchased $\n1.5\n billion (\n14.4\n million shares), $\n1.4\n billion (\n19.2\n million shares) and $\n1.6\n billion (\n22.3\n million shares), respectively, of common stock under these repurchase programs. \nDuring the period from January 1, 2025 through February 20, 2025, the Company repurchased $\n248\n (\n2.2\n million shares) \nunder the $\n3.3\n billion repurchase program effective from August 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026. \nThe timing of any repurchases of shares is dependent on several factors, including the market price of the Company's securities, the Company's capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Company's financial strength or credit ratings, the Company's blackout periods, and other considerations.\nThe Company accrued $\n12\n in excise taxes on share repurchases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, partially reduced by share issuances, which are reported in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has outstanding \n13.8\n million depositary shares each representing 1/1000th interest in a share of the Company’s 6.0% Series G non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference of $\n25,000\n per share (equivalent to $\n25.00\n per depositary share). The \n198\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 15 - Equity\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nPreferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. Dividends are recorded when declared. Dividends are payable, if declared, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year. If a dividend is not declared and paid or made payable on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for the latest completed dividend period, \nno\n dividends may be paid or declared on The Hartford’s common stock and The Hartford may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire its common stock.\nThe Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $\n25,000\n per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period. \nStatutory Results\nThe U.S. domestic insurance subsidiaries of The Hartford prepare their statutory financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance department, which vary materially from U.S. GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, recognize a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance within a special surplus account rather than as other liabilities, predominately use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the NAIC for life benefit reserves, generally carry investments in bonds at amortized cost, and present insurance assets and liabilities net of reinsurance. For reporting purposes, statutory capital and surplus is referred to collectively as \"statutory capital\". \nU.S. Statutory Net Income\n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEmployee Benefits Insurance Subsidiary\n$\n576\n \n$\n592\n \n$\n378\n \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Subsidiaries\n2,112\n \n1,887\n \n1,514\n \nTotal\n$\n2,688\n \n$\n2,479\n \n$\n1,892\n \nU.S. Statutory Capital\n \nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nEmployee Benefits Insurance Subsidiary\n$\n2,708\n \n$\n2,748\n \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Subsidiaries\n13,294\n \n12,549\n \nTotal\n$\n16,002\n \n$\n15,297\n \nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose RBC requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital \nappropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. \nAll of the Company's operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.\nSimilar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. \nAll of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries expect to maintain capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.\nDividend Restrictions\nDividends to HIG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. The Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nThe payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) \n10\n% of the insurer’s statutory policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the preceding year, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. \nProperty casualty insurers domiciled in New York, including NIC and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (\"NSIC\"), generally may not, without notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner, pay dividends out of earned surplus in any twelve‑month period that exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the most recent financial statement on file, or (ii) 100% of its adjusted net investment income, as defined, for the same twelve month period. \nCorporate members of Lloyd's Syndicates may pay dividends to its parent to the extent of available profits that have been distributed from the syndicate in excess of the Funds at Lloyd's (\"FAL\") capital requirement and subject to restrictions imposed under UK Company Law. The FAL is determined based on the syndicate’s solvency capital requirement (\"SCR\") of the syndicate under the Solvency II capital adequacy model, the current regulatory framework governing UK domiciled insurers, plus a Lloyd’s specific economic capital assessment. Insurers domiciled in the United Kingdom may pay dividends to its parent out of its statutory profits subject to restrictions imposed under U.K. Company law and Solvency II. \nThe insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the \n199\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 15 - Equity\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\npayment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiaries, regulatory capital requirements, liquidity requirements and state deposit requirements of the individual operating company.\nIn 2024, HIG Holding Company received $\n608\n of dividends from HLA, $\n136\n from Hartford Funds and $\n31\n from other non-insurance subsidiaries. In addition, HIG Holding Company received $\n1.5\n billion of net dividends from P&C subsidiaries in 2024, which excludes $\n75\n of P&C dividends that were subsequently contributed to P&C subsidiaries and $\n50\n of P&C dividends related to interest payments on an intercompany note owed by Hartford Holdings, Inc. (\"HHI\") to Hartford Fire Insurance Company. \nThe Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have regulatory dividend capacity of $\n2.0\n billion for 2025. The \nHIG Holding Company expects to receive approximately $\n1.7\n billion of net dividends after considering state deposit and regulatory capital requirements to support growth in certain entities, dividends that are expected to be subsequently contributed to P&C subsidiaries and dividends related to interest on intercompany notes. \nHLA has regulatory dividend capacity of $\n592\n in 2025 with approximately $\n590\n of dividends expected in 2025.\nThere are no current restrictions on HIG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.\n \nRestricted Net Assets\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's insurance subsidiaries had net assets of $\n15.1\n billion, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, that were restricted from payment to the HIG Holding Company, without prior regulatory approval.\n16. INCOME TAXES \nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions, as applicable. Income before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $\n3,758\n, $\n3,042\n and $\n2,260\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and income (losses) from foreign operations of $\n91\n, $\n46\n and $\n2\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nIncome Tax Expense \n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n \n \n \nCurrent - U.S. federal\n$\n783\n \n$\n582\n \n$\n550\n \n    Foreign\n2\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nTotal current\n785\n \n582\n \n549\n \nDeferred - U.S. federal\n(\n57\n)\n6\n \n(\n124\n)\n Foreign\n10\n \n(\n4\n)\n18\n \nTotal deferred\n(\n47\n)\n2\n \n(\n106\n)\n Total income tax expense\n$\n738\n \n$\n584\n \n$\n443\n \nIncome Tax Rate Reconciliation\n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nTax provision at U.S. federal statutory rate\n$\n808\n \n$\n648\n \n$\n474\n \nNontaxable net investment income\n(\n40\n)\n(\n41\n)\n(\n29\n)\nOther\n(\n30\n)\n(\n23\n)\n(\n2\n)\nProvision for income taxes \n$\n738\n \n$\n584\n \n$\n443\n \nThe current income tax receivable of $\n12\n as of December 31, 2024 is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current income tax payable of $\n18\n as of December 31, 2023, is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeferred Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets represent the tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. \nThe Company predominantly pays non-income state taxes as a percentage of premiums written which are accounted for as policy acquisition costs. State income taxes were $\n4\n, $\n3\n and $\n4\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in other expenses. The Hartford has not recorded state deferred taxes, including net deferred tax assets from state operating loss carryforwards, because the Company does not expect to earn state taxable income to utilize such state tax benefits.\n200\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 16 - Income Taxes\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nDeferred Tax Assets (Liabilities)\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax assets\nLoss reserves and tax discount\n$\n550\n \n$\n517\n \nUnearned premium reserve and other underwriting related reserves\n517\n \n483\n \nEmployee benefits\n181\n \n172\n \nNet unrealized losses on investments\n394\n \n387\n \nNet operating loss carryover\n41\n \n45\n \nOther\n—\n \n1\n \nTotal deferred tax assets\n1,683\n \n1,605\n \nValuation allowance\n—\n \n(\n12\n)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n1,683\n \n1,593\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\nDeferred acquisition costs\n(\n183\n)\n(\n163\n)\nInvestment-related items\n(\n167\n)\n(\n110\n)\nOther depreciable and amortizable assets\n(\n91\n)\n(\n147\n)\nOther\n(\n13\n)\n—\n \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n454\n)\n(\n420\n)\nNet deferred tax asset\n$\n1,229\n \n$\n1,173\n \nManagement has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets based on tax character and jurisdiction, and as part of this assessment, the Company reduced the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset for foreign net operating losses from $\n12\n as of December 31, 2023 to $\n0\n as of December 31, 2024. In making the assessment, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, the ability to hold assets to recovery, and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies which management views as prudent and feasible. \nUncertain Tax Positions\nRollforward of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n26\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n16\n \nGross increases - tax positions in current period\n3\n \n5\n \n6\n \nGross decreases - tax positions in current period\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nLapse of statute of limitations\n(\n4\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nBalance, end of period\n$\n24\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n22\n \nThe entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in the period of the release. The Company believes it is reasonably possible approximately $\n14\n of its currently unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2025 as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.\nOther Tax Matters\nThe federal statute of limitations for the Company is closed through the 2020 tax year with the exception of NOL carryforwards utilized in open tax years and the Navigators pre-acquisition 2019 tax period. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for any potential adjustments that may result from tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties (if applicable) as income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recognized net interest expenses of $\n1\n, $\n2\n and $\n1\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Employee Benefit Plans\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \nInvestment and Savings Plan\nSubstantially all U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in The Hartford Investment and Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested in a variety of investments, including up to \n10\n% in a fund consisting largely of common stock of The Hartford. The Company's contributions include a non-elective contribution of \n2.0\n% of eligible compensation and a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution of up to \n6.0\n% of eligible compensation contributed by the employee. The Company also maintains a non-qualified savings plan, The Hartford Excess Savings Plan, with the dollar-for-dollar matching contributions related to employee compensation in excess of the amount of eligible compensation that can be contributed under the tax-qualified Investment and Savings Plan. An employee's eligible compensation includes overtime and bonuses but for the Investment and Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan combined, is limited to $\n1\n annually. The total cost to The Hartford for these plans was approximately $\n193\n, $\n163\n and $\n142\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAdditionally, The Hartford has established defined contribution pension plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries. The cost to The Hartford for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for these plans was $\n3\n.\nPostretirement Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\n- \nThe Company maintains The Hartford Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Pension Plan”) that covers substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2013. The Company also maintains non-qualified pension plans to provide retirement benefits previously accrued that are in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations, as well as a Canadian defined benefit pension plan. Together, the non-qualified and Canadian defined benefit plan are referred to as \"Other Pension Plans\".\nThe U.S. Pension Plan includes two benefit formulas, both of which are frozen: a final average pay formula (for which all accruals ceased as of December 31, 2008) and a cash balance formula (for which benefit accruals ceased as of December 31, 2012, although interest will continue to accrue to existing cash balance formula account balances). Employees who were participants as of December 31, 2012 continue to earn vesting credit with respect to their frozen accrued benefits if they continue to work. \nThe interest crediting rate on the cash balance plan is the greater of the average annual yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities published in December of the prior calendar year or 3.3%.\n The Hartford Excess Pension Plan I and The Hartford Excess Pension Plan II, the Company's non-qualified excess pension benefit plans for certain highly compensated employees, are also frozen.\nGroup Retiree Health Plan\n- \nThe Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The Company’s contribution for health care benefits \nare a function of the retiree’s date of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for certain retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care obligations where such prefunding can be accomplished on a tax effective basis. Beginning January 1, 2017, for retirees 65 and older who were participating in the Retiree PPO Medical Plan, the Company funds the cost of medical and dental health care benefits through contributions to a Health Reimbursement Account and covered individuals can access a variety of insurance plans from a health care exchange. Effective January 1, 2002, Company-subsidized retiree medical, retiree dental and retiree life insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the Company on or after January 1, 2002. The Company also amended its postretirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage plans to no longer provide subsidized coverage for employees who retired on or after January 1, 2014. \nAssumptions\nPursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement expense under the defined benefit pension plans and group retiree health plan are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The yield curve used to determine the discount rate is based on yields of high-quality fixed income investments grouped by duration, using the above mean average for each duration group. Based on all available market and industry information, it was determined that \n5.65\n% and \n5.56\n% were the appropriate discount rates as of December 31, 2024 to calculate the Company’s U.S. Pension Plan and other postretirement obligations, respectively. \nThe expected long-term rate of return considers both current market yields and forecasted investment returns expected to be achieved by the plan’s investment strategy over the remaining life of the plan. \nThe Company also considers the plan's funded status, the investment volatility, duration and total returns for various time periods related to the characteristics of the pension obligation, which are influenced by the Company's workforce demographics. For the pension plan, the Company has assumed an allocation of approximately \n81\n% in fixed income securities and \n19\n% in non-fixed income securities (global equities and limited partnerships) in its assumed expected long-term rate of return for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the other postretirement plans, the Company has assumed an allocation of \n100\n% in fixed income securities in its assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Based upon these analyses, management determined the long-term rate of return assumption to be \n5.90\n% and \n4.50\n% for the Company's U.S. Pension Plan and other postretirement obligations, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024 and \n6.10\n% and \n4.50\n% for the Company's U.S. Pension Plan and other postretirement obligations, respectively, for the year \n204\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 18 - Employee Benefit Plans\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nended December 31, 2023. To determine the Company's 2025 expense, the Company has assumed an allocation of \n81\n% in fixed income securities and \n19\n% in non-fixed income securities for the pension plan and an allocation of \n100\n% in fixed income securities for the postretirement plans, contributing to an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of \n6.40\n% and \n4.80\n% for the Company's U.S. Pension Plan and other postretirement obligations, respectively.\nAssumptions Used in Calculating the Benefit Obligations and the Net Amount Recognized\nFor the years ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted Average Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations\nDiscount rate:\nU.S. Pension Plan\n5.65\n \n%\n5.15\n \n%\n5.43\n \n%\nOther Pension Plans\n5.59\n \n%\n5.14\n \n%\n5.40\n \n%\nOther postretirement benefits\n5.56\n \n%\n5.13\n \n%\n5.39\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate on cash balance plan\n4.30\n \n%\n4.36\n \n%\n3.89\n \n%\nWeighted Average Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate:\nU.S. Pension Plan\n5.15\n \n%\n5.43\n \n%\n2.91\n \n%\nOther Pension Plans\n5.13\n \n%\n5.40\n \n%\n2.83\n \n%\nOther postretirement benefits\n5.13\n \n%\n5.39\n \n%\n2.72\n \n%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets:\nU.S. Pension Plan\n5.90\n \n%\n6.10\n \n%\n5.10\n \n%\nOther Pension Plans\n4.00\n \n%\n4.40\n \n%\n3.30\n \n%\nOther postretirement benefits\n4.50\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\n4.80\n \n%\nAssumed Health Care Cost Trend Rates\nPre-65 health care cost trend rate\n6.50\n \n%\n8.00\n \n%\n7.00\n \n%\nPost-65 health care cost trend rate\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)\n4.00\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\n2045\n2038\n2032\nObligations and Funded Status\nThe following tables set forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

Changes in assumptions in 2023 included an $\n88\n increase in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of a decrease in the discount rate from \n5.43\n% as of the December 31, 2022 valuation to \n5.15\n% as of the December 31, 2023 valuation. \nChanges in assumptions for the Other Pension Plans in 2024 primarily included a $\n12\n decrease in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of an increase in the discount rate from \n5.14\n% as of the December 31, 2023 valuation to \n5.59\n% as of the December 31, 2024 valuation.

The Company made \nno\n contribution in 2024, but contributed $\n3\n to the rabbi trusts in 2023. The assets do not qualify as plan assets; however, the assets are available to pay benefits for certain retired, terminated and active participants.

With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the U.S. Pension Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; selecting qualified service providers such as investment managers and investment consultants; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular basis; and monitoring performance to determine whether or not the rate of return objectives are being met and that policy and \nguidelines are being followed. The Pension Investment Committee has adopted a de-risking glide path that reduces the target allocation to equity securities and limited partnerships and increases the allocation to fixed income securities over time in response to improvement in the funded status of the U.S. Pension Plan. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the U.S. Pension Plan.\nTarget Asset Allocation Ranges\n \nPension Plans\nOther Postretirement Plans\nMinimum\nMaximum\nMinimum\nMaximum\nEquity securities\n—\n \n%\n20\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nFixed income securities\n75\n \n%\n95\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nLimited partnerships\n—\n \n%\n25\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nDivergent market performance among different asset classes and changes in the context of the glide path may, from time to \n207\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 18 - Employee Benefit Plans\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ntime, cause the asset allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used first, as necessary, to bring the allocation within tactical ranges, before shifting assets across portfolios.\nThe U.S. Pension Plan invests in multiple asset classes reflecting the current needs, investment preferences, risk tolerances and the desired degree of diversification of the U.S. Pension Plan. These asset classes include publicly traded fixed \nincome securities and equities, private fixed income securities, commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships. Investment portfolios are primarily managed by affiliated managers.\nIn addition, the Company uses U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts and U.S. Treasury STRIPS, in addition to certain other investments, in a duration overlay program to adjust the duration of U.S. Pension Plan assets to better match the duration of the benefit obligation.\nPension Plan Assets at Fair Value \nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAsset Category\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nShort-term investments:\n$\n164\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n164\n \n$\n187\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n187\n \nFixed Income Securities:\nCorporate\n—\n \n1,586\n \n33\n \n1,619\n \n—\n \n1,643\n \n36\n \n1,679\n \nRMBS\n—\n \n105\n \n—\n \n105\n \n—\n \n111\n \n—\n \n111\n \nU.S. Treasuries\n8\n \n278\n \n—\n \n286\n \n—\n \n271\n \n—\n \n271\n \nForeign government\n—\n \n9\n \n9\n \n18\n \n—\n \n11\n \n10\n \n21\n \nCMBS\n—\n \n28\n \n1\n \n29\n \n—\n \n49\n \n1\n \n50\n \nOther fixed income [1]\n—\n \n162\n \n—\n \n162\n \n—\n \n160\n \n—\n \n160\n \n  Mortgage Loans\n—\n \n—\n \n131\n \n131\n \n—\n \n—\n \n143\n \n143\n \nEquity Securities:\nDomestic\n14\n \n4\n \n—\n \n18\n \n11\n \n23\n \n—\n \n34\n \nInternational\n—\n \n37\n \n—\n \n37\n \n—\n \n45\n \n—\n \n45\n \nTotal pension plan assets at fair value, in the fair value hierarchy [2]\n186\n \n2,209\n \n174\n \n2,569\n \n198\n \n2,313\n \n190\n \n2,701\n \nOther Investments, at net asset value [3]:\nLimited partnerships\n778\n \n826\n \nTotal pension plan assets at fair value\n$\n186\n \n$\n2,209\n \n$\n174\n \n$\n3,347\n \n$\n198\n \n$\n2,313\n \n$\n190\n \n$\n3,527\n \n[1]\nIncludes ABS, municipal bonds and CLOs.\n[2]\nExcludes $\n49\n and $\n46\n as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of investment receivables net of investment payables that are excluded from this disclosure requirement because they are trade receivables in the ordinary course of business where the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n[3]\nInvestments that are measured at net asset value per share or an equivalent and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. \nThe tables below provide fair value level 3 roll forwards for the U.S. Pension Plan Assets for which significant unobservable inputs (\"Level 3\") are used in the fair value measurement on a recurring basis.

In addition, the Pension Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible investment options. Permissible investments include U.S. equity, international equity, limited partnership and fixed income investments including derivative instruments. Permissible derivative instruments include futures contracts, options, swaps, currency forwards, caps or floors and may be used to control risk or enhance return but will not be used for leverage purposes.\nSecurities specifically prohibited from purchase include, but are not limited to: shares or fixed income instruments issued by The Hartford (other than equity securities purchased on the open market as part of a passively managed strategy), short sales of any type within long-only portfolios, non-derivative securities involving the use of margin, leveraged floaters and inverse floaters, including money market obligations, natural resource real properties such as oil, gas or timber and precious metals.\nOther than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Pension Plan does not have any material exposure to any concentration risk of a single issuer.\n209\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 18 - Employee Benefit Plans\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nExpected Employer Contributions\nThe Company does not have a 2025 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan.

STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS \nThe Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below. Shares issued in satisfaction of stock-based compensation may be made available from authorized but unissued shares, shares held by the Company in treasury or from shares purchased in the open market. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued shares from treasury in satisfaction of stock-based compensation\n.\nThe Hartford measures stock compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense, included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, was as follows:\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStock-based compensation plans expense\n$\n133\n \n$\n125\n \n$\n131\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n21\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n22\n)\nExcess tax benefit on awards vested, exercised and expired\n(\n21\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n12\n)\nTotal stock-based compensation plans expense, net of tax\n$\n91\n \n$\n91\n \n$\n97\n \nThe Company did not capitalize any cost of stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2024, the total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $\n75\n, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n2\n years.\nStock Plan \nFuture stock-based awards may be granted under The Hartford's 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"Stock Incentive Plan\") other than the Subsidiary Stock Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan described below. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for awards to be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock or restricted stock units, or any other form of stock-based award. The maximum number of shares, subject to adjustments set forth in the 2020 Stock Plan, that may be issued to Company employees and third-party service providers during the \n10\n-year duration of the Stock Incentive Plan is the sum of \n11,250,000\n shares, any shares forfeited subsequent to February 29, 2020, plus any shares used for tax withholding purposes. If any award under an earlier incentive stock plan is forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expires unexercised, or is settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the net issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number subject to the award, the shares of stock subject to such award (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for awards under the Stock Incentive Plan and such shares shall be added to the maximum limit. As of December 31, 2024, there were \n6,253,061\n shares available for future issuance.\nThe fair values of awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan are measured as of the grant date and expensed ratably over the awards’ vesting periods, generally \nthree years\n. For stock awards to retirement-eligible employees, the Company recognizes the expense over a period shorter than the stated vesting period because the employees receive accelerated vesting upon retirement and, therefore, the vesting period is considered non-substantive.\n210\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 19 - Stock Compensation Plans\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nStock Option Awards\nUnder the Stock Incentive Plan, options granted have an exercise price at least equal to the closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange for the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is not to exceed \n10\n years. Options generally become exercisable over a period of \nthree years\n commencing \none year\n from the date of grant. \nThe Company uses a hybrid lattice/Monte-Carlo based option valuation model (the “Plan Valuation Model”) that incorporates the possibility of early exercise of options into the valuation. The Plan Valuation Model also incorporates the Company’s historical termination and exercise experience to determine the option value.\nThe Plan Valuation Model incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, and those ranges are disclosed below. The term structure of volatility is generally constructed utilizing implied volatilities from exchange-traded options, historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the Plan Valuation Model, and accommodates variations in employee preference and risk-tolerance by segregating the grantee pool into a series of behavioral cohorts and conducting a fair valuation for each cohort individually. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option Plan Valuation Model and represents, in a mathematical sense, the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \nStock Options Valuation Assumptions\n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected dividend yield\n1.8\n%\n2.0\n%\n2.3\n%\nExpected annualized spot volatility\n19.2\n \n%\n-\n22.7\n%\n24.5\n \n%\n-\n26.0\n%\n28.3\n \n%\n-\n29.6\n%\nWeighted average annualized volatility\n21.7\n%\n25.4\n%\n28.8\n%\nRisk-free spot rate\n4.3\n \n%\n-\n5.5\n%\n3.8\n \n%\n-\n5.1\n%\n(\n0.04\n)\n%\n-\n2.0\n%\nExpected term\n7.4\n years\n6.7\n years\n6.4\n years\nNon-qualified Stock Option Activity Under the Stock Incentive Plan\nNumber of Options\n(in thousands)\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm\nAggregate\nIntrinsic Value\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nOutstanding at beginning of year\n6,071\n \n$\n55.92\n \nGranted\n270\n \n$\n95.74\n \nExercised\n(\n1,823\n)\n$\n50.45\n \nForfeited\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nExpired\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nOutstanding at end of year\n4,518\n \n$\n60.51\n \n5.4\n$\n221\n \nOutstanding, fully vested and expected to vest\n4,494\n \n$\n60.40\n \n5.4\n$\n221\n \nExercisable at end of year\n3,711\n \n$\n55.85\n \n4.8\n$\n199\n \nAggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative intrinsic value.

The Hartford recognized tax benefits of $\n4\n, $\n3\n, and $\n3\n on stock options exercised for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n, respectively. \nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised \nduring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n99\n, $\n35\n, and $\n24\n, respectively.\nShare Awards\nShare awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan and outstanding include restricted stock units and performance shares. \nPerformance shares become payable within a range of \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the number of shares initially granted based upon the attainment of specific performance goals achieved at the end of a performance period of \nthree years\n. For the 2021 grant year only, the grant was subject to a modifier that increased final performance by 10% based upon results against predetermined year-end 2023 representation goals for women and people of color in executive level roles\n.\n211\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 19 - Stock Compensation Plans\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nPerformance share awards that are not dependent on market conditions are valued equal to the closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange for the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards without market conditions is based on a current estimate of the number of awards expected to vest based on the performance level achieved and, therefore, may change during the performance period as new estimates of performance are available.\nOther performance share awards or portions thereof have a market condition based upon the Company's total stockholder \nreturn relative to a pre-determined group of peer companies as of December 31 at the end of the \nthree year\n performance period. Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards is based on the number of awards expected to vest as estimated at the grant date and, therefore, does not change for changes in estimated performance.

Upon employee vesting of subsidiary stock, the Company recognizes a noncontrolling equity interest. Employees are restricted from selling vested subsidiary stock to anyone other than the Company and the Company has discretion on the amount of stock to repurchase. Therefore, the subsidiary stock is classified \n212\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 19 - Stock Compensation Plans\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nas equity because it is not mandatorily redeemable.

Under this plan, eligible employees of The Hartford purchase common stock of the Company at a discount rate of \n5\n% of the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period. Accordingly, the plan is a non-compensatory plan. Employees purchase a variable number of \nshares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to \n15,400,000\n shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2024, there were \n3,014,109\n shares available for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, \n141,500\n shares, \n194,561\n shares, and \n194,504\n shares were sold, respectively.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER COSTS\nIn recognition of the need to become more cost efficient and competitive along with enhancing the experience we provide to agents and customers, on July 30, 2020 the Company announced an operational transformation and cost reduction plan it refers to as Hartford Next. Hartford Next is intended to reduce annual insurance operating costs and other expenses through reduction of the Company's headcount, investment in information technology (\"IT\") to further enhance our capabilities, and other activities. \nTermination benefits related to workforce reductions and professional fees are included within restructuring and other costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and unpaid restructuring costs are included in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\n, the severance \nbenefits accrual was reduced by $\n6\n, and $\n7\n respectively, due to more recent experience of higher than expected voluntary attrition.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the program is substantially complete, though the Company may incur additional costs related to real estate that has been temporarily idled as part of Hartford Next. Any other remaining costs, including amortization of right of use assets, other lease exit costs, IT costs to retire applications and other expenses are expected to be immaterial.\nTotal restructuring and other costs, excluding any additional costs related to temporarily idled real estate, are expected to be approximately \n$\n127\n, before tax, and have been recognized in the Corporate category for segment reporting.\nRestructuring and Other Costs, Before Tax\nIncurred in the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nIncurred in the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIncurred in the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nCumulative Incurred in the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nTotal Amount Expected to be Incurred\nSeverance benefits\n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n35\n \n$\n35\n \nIT costs\n8\n \n5\n \n—\n \n25\n \n25\n \nProfessional fees and other expenses\n12\n \n7\n \n2\n \n67\n \n67\n \nTotal restructuring and other costs, before tax\n$\n13\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n127\n \n$\n127\n \nAccrued Restructuring and Other Costs\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nSeverance Benefits and Related Costs\nIT Costs\nProfessional Fees and Other\nTotal Restructuring and Other Costs Liability\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nIncurred\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n2\n \nPayments\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nBalance, end of period\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nAccrued Restructuring and Other Costs\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nSeverance Benefits and Related Costs\nIT Costs\nProfessional Fees and Other\nTotal Restructuring and Other Costs Liability\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \nIncurred\n(\n6\n)\n5\n \n7\n \n6\n \nPayments\n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n13\n)\nBalance, end of period\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n214\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 22 - Subsequent Events\n22. \nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nLosses from California Wildfires\nBeginning January 7, 2025, a series of destructive wildfires affected the Los Angeles County area in California. Based on claims reported and other available information, the Company's preliminary loss estimate from these wildfires for the first quarter of 2025, including potential assessments from the California FAIR Plan, is a range of $\n300\n to $\n350\n, net of reinsurance and before tax. The estimate is subject to variability due to the timing of reported claims, the extent of damage to personal and commercial property and automobiles, uncertainty of the availability for recoveries, including potential subrogation, and other factors that may not yet be known to the Company. Given these uncertainties, the wildfire losses may deviate from our estimate.\n215\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nPart IV - Schedule I.
