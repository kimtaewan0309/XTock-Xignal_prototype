We are engaged primarily in the energy delivery business through the following wholly-owned utility subsidiaries:\n•\nThe Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut;\n•\nNSTAR Electric Company (NSTAR Electric), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of eastern and western Massachusetts and owns solar power facilities, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harbor Electric Energy Company (HEEC), also a regulated electric utility that distributes electric energy to its sole customer;\n•\nPublic Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of New Hampshire; \n•\nNSTAR Gas Company (NSTAR Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;\n•\nEversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;\n•\nYankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut; and\n•\nAquarion Company (Aquarion), a utility holding company that owns five separate regulated water utility subsidiaries and collectively serves residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection customers in parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  Eversource is currently in the process of selling its Aquarion water distribution business. For further information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Pending Sale of Aquarion\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH also serve New England customers through Eversource's electric transmission business.  Along with NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas, each is doing business as Eversource Energy in its respective service territory.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each report their financial results separately.  We also include information in this report on a segment basis for Eversource.  Eversource has four reportable segments: electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution and water distribution.  These segments represent substantially all of Eversource's total consolidated revenues.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH do not report separate business segments.   \nEversource’s previous offshore wind business included 50 percent ownership interests in each of North East Offshore and South Fork Class B Member, LLC.  In the third quarter of 2024, Eversource sold its interest in these entities, and in doing so, sold its interests in the Revolution Wind project, the South Fork Wind project, and the Sunrise Wind project.  Eversource’s current offshore wind business is now comprised only of a noncontrolling tax equity investment in South Fork Wind.  For more information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Offshore Wind Business\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nEversource's electric distribution segment consists of the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, which are engaged in the distribution of electricity to retail customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively, and the solar power facilities of NSTAR Electric.\n2\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – CONNECTICUT – THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY\nCL&P's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers.  As of December 31, 2024, CL&P furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.30 million customers in 157 cities and towns in Connecticut.  CL&P does not own any electric generation facilities.\nRates\nCL&P is subject to regulation by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA), which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.  CL&P's present general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services.  \nUnder Connecticut law, all of CL&P's customers are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while CL&P remains their electric distribution company.  For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, CL&P purchases power on behalf of, and passes the related cost without mark-up through to, those customers under standard service (SS) rates for customers with less than 500 kilowatts of demand (residential customers and small and medium commercial and industrial customers), and supplier of last resort service (LRS) rates for customers with 500 kilowatts or more of demand (larger commercial and industrial customers).  CL&P charges customers only the amount that it pays generators for producing electricity and does not earn a profit on the cost of electricity.\nCL&P's retail rates include an energy supply component and a delivery service component, which includes distribution, transmission, conservation, renewable energy programs and other public benefit charges that are assessed on all customers.  The rates established by PURA for CL&P, which are grouped by the customer bill components, are comprised of the following:\nSupply:  \nCost of electricity from suppliers based on competitive procurements.\n•\nAn electric generation service charge, which recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers.  The generation service charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nLocal Delivery:  \nCost to build, maintain, repair and operate the distribution grid, including the poles, lines, and meters that deliver power from the substation.  It also includes the cost of resiliency and reliability improvements.\n•\nA distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers, as well as ongoing operating costs to maintain the infrastructure.  \n•\nA revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by PURA.   \n•\nAn Electric System Improvements (ESI) charge, which collects the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers above the level recovered through the distribution charge.  The ESI also recovers costs associated with CL&P’s system resiliency program.  The ESI is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.  In 2023, the state of Connecticut enacted a law that prohibits CL&P’s ESI capital tracking mechanism from being reauthorized in the next general distribution proceeding.  The ESI will therefore remain in place until base distribution rates are adjusted in CL&P’s next general distribution rate proceeding.\n•\nA Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) charge, assessed to recover stranded costs associated with electric industry restructuring such as various IPP contracts.  The CTA is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nPublic Benefits:  \nCost to support energy programs mandated by the state and federal government for financial assistance and energy efficiency programs, purchasing renewable and carbon-free electricity, and funding solar and electric vehicle incentives.\n•\nA Federally Mandated Congestion Charge (FMCC), which recovers any costs imposed by the FERC as part of the New England Standard Market Design, including locational marginal pricing, locational installed capacity payments, any costs approved by PURA to reduce these charges, as well as other costs approved by PURA.  These costs include costs associated with ISO-NE, costs to avoid congestion on the transmission system, purchase contracts with zero-carbon energy generators (including the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear contracts) and with renewable energy generators, costs for capacity and gas peaker plants, renewable energy credits, and other initiatives required by state law.  The non-bypassable component of the FMCC is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.  CL&P is required by regulation to purchase electric generation from Millstone and Seabrook under PURA-approved PPAs entered into in 2019.  CL&P does not have legislative authority to use this purchased output to serve its customer load and therefore sells the energy into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset the contract costs.  The net cost or net sales amount is recovered from, or refunded to, customers in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC rate with no company profit.    \n3\n•\nA Systems Benefits Charge (SBC), established to fund expenses associated with various hardship and low-income programs.  The SBC is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.  \n•\nA Renewable Energy Investment Charge, which is used to promote investment in renewable energy sources.  Amounts collected by this charge are deposited into the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund and administered by the Connecticut Green Bank.  \n•\nA Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) charge established to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs and market transformation initiatives.  The CAM charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers through an approved adjustment to the following year’s energy conservation spending plan budget.\nTransmission: \n Cost to maintain high voltage towers and lines, including building, maintaining and operating the regional transmission system that brings electricity from power generators to the local distribution system.\n•\nA transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.  The transmission charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDistribution Rate Case and Settlement Agreement\n:  CL&P's distribution rates were established in an April 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective May 1, 2018, and incremental step adjustments effective May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2020.  In accordance with a 2021 settlement agreement, CL&P agreed that its current base distribution rates would be frozen, subject to certain customer credits, until no earlier than January 1, 2024.  The rate freeze applied only to base distribution rates (including storm costs) and not to other rate mechanisms such as the retail rate components, rate reconciling mechanisms, formula rates and any other adjustment mechanisms.  The rate freeze also did not apply to any cost recovery mechanism outside of the base distribution rates with regard to grid-modernization initiatives or any other proceedings that were either pending or that could be initiated during the rate freeze period, that could have placed additional obligations on CL&P.  The approval of the settlement agreement satisfied the Connecticut statute of rate review requirements that requires electric utilities to file a distribution rate case within four years of the last rate case.\nCL&P Performance Based Rate Making\n:  PURA currently has an open proceeding to evaluate and eventually implement performance based regulation (PBR) for electric distribution companies.  For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nAs noted above, CL&P does not own any generation assets and purchases energy supply to serve its SS and LRS loads from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals.  During 2024, CL&P supplied approximately 45 percent of its customer load at SS or LRS rates while the other 55 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers.  In terms of the total number of CL&P customers, this equates to 21 percent being on competitive supply, while 79 percent remain with SS or LRS.  Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on CL&P's electric distribution business or its operating income.\nAs approved by PURA, CL&P periodically enters into full requirements supply contracts for SS loads for periods of up to one year.  CL&P typically enters into full requirements supply contracts for LRS loads every three months.  If CL&P does not obtain full requirements supply contracts for 100 percent of the customer load for any period, it is authorized by PURA to meet the remaining load obligations directly through the ISO-NE wholesale markets.  Currently, CL&P has full requirements supply contracts in place for 100 percent of its SS load for the first half of 2025.  For the second half of 2025, CL&P has 50 percent of its SS load under full requirements supply contracts and intends to purchase an additional 50 percent of full requirements.  None of the SS load for 2026 has been procured.  CL&P obtained a full requirements supply contract for its LRS load through March 2025 and intends to purchase 100 percent of full requirements for LRS for the remainder of 2025.  CL&P is prepared to self-manage the LRS load if unable to obtain full requirements supply contracts for LRS.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – MASSACHUSETTS – NSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY\nNSTAR Electric's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers.  As of December 31, 2024, NSTAR Electric furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.58 million customers in 159 cities and towns in eastern and western Massachusetts, including Boston, Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and the greater Springfield metropolitan area.\nNSTAR Electric does not own any generating facilities that are used to supply customers, and purchases its energy requirements from competitive energy suppliers. NSTAR Electric owns, operates and maintains a total of 70 MW of solar power facilities on twenty-two sites in Massachusetts.  NSTAR Electric sells energy from these facilities into the ISO-NE market, with proceeds credited to customers.\n4\nRates\nNSTAR Electric is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU), which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, acquisition of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.  The present general rate structure for NSTAR Electric consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services.\nUnder Massachusetts law, all customers of NSTAR Electric are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while NSTAR Electric remains their electric distribution company.  For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, NSTAR Electric purchases power from competitive suppliers on behalf of, and passes the related cost without mark-up through to, those customers (basic service).  Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through basic service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier.  NSTAR Electric charges customers only the amount that it pays generators for producing electricity and does not earn a profit on the cost of electricity.  \nNSTAR Electric's retail rates include a supply component and a delivery component, which include distribution, transmission, renewable energy programs and other public policy charges that are assessed on all customers.  The rates established by the DPU for NSTAR Electric, which are grouped by the customer bill components, are comprised of the following:\nSupply:  \nCost of electricity from suppliers based on competitive procurements. \n•\nA basic service charge that represents the collection of energy costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers, including costs related to charge-offs of uncollectible energy costs from customers.  Basic service rates are reset every six months (every three months for large commercial and industrial customers).  Additionally, the DPU has authorized NSTAR Electric to recover the cost of its NSTAR Green wind contracts through the basic service charge.  Basic service costs are reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDelivery:  \nCost of grid maintenance and other critical customer services and also includes government-mandated charges.\n•\nA distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the distribution infrastructure to deliver electricity to its destination, as well as ongoing operating costs.\n•\nA revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU.  Annual base distribution amounts are adjusted for inflation and certain other items and filed for approval by the DPU on an annual basis, until the next rate case.\n•\nA transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.  The transmission charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•\nA transition charge that represents costs to be collected primarily from previously held investments in generating plants, costs related to existing above-market power contracts, and contract costs related to long-term power contract buy-outs.  The transition charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•\nA renewable energy charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to support the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Trust Fund. \n•\nAn energy efficiency charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to collect costs for energy efficiency programs.  The energy efficiency charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•\nReconciling adjustment charges that recover certain DPU-approved costs, including pension and PBOP benefits, low income customer discounts, credits issued to net metering facilities installed by customers, payments to solar facilities qualified under the state solar renewable energy target program, attorney general consultant expenses, long-term renewable contracts, company-owned solar facilities, vegetation management costs, storm restoration, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, grid modernization costs, advanced metering infrastructure costs, electric vehicle make-ready infrastructure costs, and provisional system planning charges.  These charges are reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.  \nDistribution Rate Case\n:  NSTAR Electric distribution rates were established in a November 2022 DPU-approved rate case, with rates effective January 1, 2023.  The DPU approved a renewal of the PBR plan originally authorized in its last rate case for a five-year term, with a corresponding stay out provision.  The PBR plan term has the possibility of a five-year extension.  The PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation, exogenous events and future capital additions based on a historical five-year average of total capital additions.  For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n5\nService Quality Metrics\n:  NSTAR Electric is subject to service quality (SQ) metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service, and could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual transmission and distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics.  NSTAR Electric will not be required to pay a SQ charge for its 2024 performance as the company achieved results at or above target for all of its SQ metrics in 2024.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nAs noted above, NSTAR Electric does not own generation assets (other than 70 MW of solar power facilities that produce energy that is sold into the ISO-NE market) and purchases its energy supply requirements from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals issued periodically, consistent with DPU regulations.  As approved by the DPU, NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for approximately 26 percent\n \nof its residential and 14 percent of its small commercial and industrial (C&I) customers twice per year for twelve-month terms.  NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for three percent\n \nof its large C&I customers every three months. \nDuring 2024, NSTAR Electric supplied approximately 14 percent of its overall customer load at basic service rates.  The remaining 86 percent of its overall customer load was served either by municipal aggregation or competitive supply.  Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on NSTAR Electric’s electric distribution business or its operating income.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – NEW HAMPSHIRE – PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\nPSNH's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers.  As of December 31, 2024, PSNH furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 544,000 retail customers in 206 cities and towns in New Hampshire.  PSNH does not own any electric generation facilities.\nRates\nPSNH is subject to regulation by the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC), which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nUnder New Hampshire law, all of PSNH's customers are entitled to choose competitive energy suppliers.  For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, PSNH purchases power on behalf of, and passes the related cost without mark-up through to, those customers (default energy service).  PSNH charges customers only the amount that it pays generators for producing electricity and does not earn a profit on the cost of electricity.\nPSNH's retail rates include a supply component and a delivery component, which include distribution, transmission, renewable energy programs and other public policy charges that are assessed on all customers.  The rates established by the NHPUC for PSNH, which are grouped by the customer bill components, are comprised of the following:\nSupply:  \nCost of electricity from suppliers based on competitive procurements. \n•\nA default energy service charge recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers.  The default energy service charge changes semi-annually, and is reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDelivery:  \nCost of building, maintaining and operating distribution and transmission systems, as well as state and federally mandated charges that fund financial assistance, energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.\n•\nA distribution charge, which includes kilowatt-hour and/or demand-based charges to recover costs related to the maintenance and operation of PSNH's infrastructure to deliver power to its destination, as well as power restoration and service costs.  It also includes a customer charge to collect the cost of providing service to a customer; such as the installation, maintenance, reading and replacement of meters and maintaining accounts and records.  \n•\nA Transmission Charge Adjustment Mechanism (TCAM) that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.  The transmission charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the NHPUC, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. \n•\nA Stranded Cost Recovery Charge (SCRC), which allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs, including above-market expenses incurred under mandated power purchase obligations, recovery of costs of the net metering credit program, a credit for revenues generated by the RGGI program, other long-term investments and obligations, and the remaining costs associated with the 2018 sales of its generation facilities.  The SCRC rate changes annually with the option to change semi-annually, and is reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n6\n•\nA Systems Benefits Charge (SBC), which funds energy efficiency programs for all customers, as well as assistance programs for residential customers within certain income guidelines.  The SBC also has a component for the company to collect lost base revenue (LBR) from the implementation of energy efficiency measures.  LBR will remain a component of the SBC charge unless and until PSNH has a decoupling or other revenue adjustment mechanism approved by the NHPUC.  The SBC rate changes annually and is reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•\nA Regulatory Reconciliation Adjustment (RRA) that reconciles the difference between certain estimated and actual costs included in base distribution rates, including costs related to regulatory assessments, vegetation management program expenses, property tax expenses, storm cost amortization updated for the actual cost of long-term debt and lost base revenues related to net metering.\n•\nA Pole Plant Adjustment Mechanism (PPAM) that recovers certain costs associated with poles acquired under a 2023 purchase agreement between PSNH and Consolidated Communications, including the operation and maintenance of poles, pole inspections, and vegetation management expenses incurred, beginning February 10, 2021 through April 30, 2023.\nDistribution Rate Case and Settlement Agreement\n:  PSNH's distribution rates were established in a 2020 NHPUC-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective January 1, 2021.  PSNH was permitted three step increases, effective January 1, 2021, August 1, 2021, and November 1, 2022 to reflect plant additions in calendar years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nOn June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for approval of a temporary annual base distribution rate increase effective August 1, 2024, which was approved by the NHPUC on July 31, 2024.  Also on June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC to request an increase in permanent base distribution rates, proposed to take effect August 1, 2025.  A decision by the NHPUC on permanent rates is expected by August 1, 2025.  For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - New Hampshire\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nPSNH does not own any generation assets and as approved by the NHPUC, purchases energy supply from a variety of competitive suppliers for its energy service customers through requests for proposals issued twice per year, for six-month terms, for approximately 58 percent of its residential and small C&I customers and for 15 percent of its large C&I customers.  As required by the NHPUC, PSNH purchased 12.5 percent of its residential and small C&I customer load through direct wholesale market participation for the second half of 2024.\nDuring 2024, PSNH supplied approximately 58 percent of its customer load at default energy service rates while the other 42 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers.  Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on PSNH’s electric distribution business or its operating income.\nELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each own and maintain transmission facilities that are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which electricity is transmitted throughout New England.  Each of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and most other New England utilities, are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's transmission facilities and the rules by which they acquire transmission services.  Under these arrangements, ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of directors and staff are independent of all market participants, serves as the regional transmission organization of the New England transmission system.  \nWholesale Transmission Rates and Transmission Proceedings\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH wholesale transmission rates are calculated in accordance with a FERC-approved formula ratemaking framework and each utility is required to file an annual update on or before July 31st with resulting rates effective January 1st the following year. The formula rate framework provides for an annual reconciliation of the prior calendar year actual costs incurred related to our transmission facilities, including an allowed ROE, plus forecasted information through the next rate period.  The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, transmission wholesale customers. The annual update process also includes formula rate protocols that provide disclosure of cost inputs, an opportunity for informal discovery procedures and a challenge process, which provides transparency to stakeholders. The transmission rates are collected from New England wholesale customers, including distribution customers of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  \nFrom time to time, various matters are pending before FERC relating to transmission rates, incentives, interconnections and transmission planning. Depending on the outcome, any of these matters could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. At this time, Eversource cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the matters currently pending before FERC, and the resulting impact on its transmission incentives or planning.\nTransmission Rate Base\nTransmission rate base under our FERC-approved tariff primarily consists of our investment in transmission net utility plant less accumulated deferred income taxes.  Under our FERC-approved tariff, investments in net utility plant generally enter rate base after they are placed in commercial operation.  At the end of 2024, our estimated transmission rate base was approximately $10.8 billion, including approximately $4.4 billion at CL&P, $4.4 billion at NSTAR Electric, and $2.0 billion at PSNH.\n7\nFERC ROE Complaints\nFour separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants).  In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15-month complaint periods.  In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable. \nIn response to appeals of the FERC decision in the first complaint filed by the NETOs and the Complainants, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court) issued a decision on April 14, 2017 vacating and remanding the FERC's decision.  On October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court.  FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE.  \nDuring 2019 and 2020, FERC also issued multiple decisions in two pending transmission ROE complaints against the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) transmission owners, in which FERC adopted new methodologies for determining base ROEs.  On August 9, 2022, the Court issued a decision vacating these MISO FERC decisions and remanded to FERC to reopen the proceedings.  On October 17, 2024, FERC issued an order on the remand of the MISO ROE proceedings.  On February 4, 2025, the MISO transmission owners submitted a petition for review with the Court requesting review of the October 17, 2024 MISO ROE order on remand and a December 19, 2024 notice of denial of rehearing.  \nOn November 13, 2024, the NETOs filed a supplemental brief in their four pending ROE proceedings to explain to FERC that it cannot apply the reasoning and methodologies of the MISO ROE case to the NETOs’ cases due to the entirely different set of facts in the MISO and NETOs ROE proceedings.  Doing so would violate the substance of the Court’s April 14, 2017 order and would violate the legal standard required by the Federal Power Act. \nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the applicability of the FERC order in the MISO transmission owners’ two complaint cases to the NETOs’ pending four complaint cases due to the complex differences between the cases, Eversource concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaints or subsequent periods at this time and Eversource cannot reasonably estimate any potential range of loss for any of the four complaint proceedings at this time.  The resolution of these proceedings could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  For further information, see \"FERC Regulatory Matters - FERC ROE Complaints\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nNATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nNSTAR Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 315,000 customers in 59 communities in central and eastern Massachusetts.  EGMA distributes natural gas to approximately 332,000 customers in 66 communities throughout Massachusetts.  Yankee Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 254,000 customers in 85 cities and towns in Connecticut.  Our natural gas businesses provide firm natural gas sales and transportation service to eligible retail customers who require a continuous natural gas supply throughout the year, such as residential customers who rely on natural gas for heating, hot water and cooking needs, as well as commercial and industrial customers who rely on natural gas for space heating, hot water, cooking and commercial and industrial applications.  Total throughput (sales and transportation) in 2024 was approximately 69.0 Bcf for NSTAR Gas, 54.8 Bcf for EGMA, and 59.5 Bcf for Yankee Gas. \nNSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas generate revenues primarily through the sale and/or transportation of natural gas.  All NSTAR Gas and EGMA retail customers have the ability to choose to purchase gas from third party marketers under the Massachusetts Retail Choice program.  In the past year in Massachusetts, Retail Choice represented only approximately one percent of the total residential load, while Retail Choice represented approximately 40 percent of the total commercial and industrial load.  Retail natural gas service in Connecticut is partially unbundled: residential customers in Yankee Gas' service territory buy natural gas supply and delivery only from Yankee Gas while commercial and industrial customers may choose their natural gas suppliers.  For customers who purchase natural gas from NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas, the purchased natural gas commodity cost is passed through to those customers without mark-up.  NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas do not earn a profit on the cost of purchased gas. \nFirm transportation service is offered to customers who purchase natural gas from sources other than NSTAR Gas, EGMA or Yankee Gas. NSTAR Gas and EGMA have the ability to offer interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to high volume commercial and industrial customers.  Yankee Gas offers interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to commercial and industrial customers who have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel on short notice.  NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas can interrupt service to these customers during peak demand periods or at any other time to maintain distribution system integrity. \nA portion of the storage of natural gas supply for NSTAR Gas and EGMA during the winter heating season is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource.  NSTAR Gas has access to facilities consisting of an LNG liquefaction and vaporization plant and three above-ground cryogenic storage tanks having an aggregate capacity of 3.0 Bcf of liquefied natural gas and facilities that include additional storage capacity of 0.5 Bcf. Total vaporization capacity of these facilities is 0.21 Bcf per day.  EGMA has access to approximately 1.7 Bcf of LNG and 0.1 Bcf of LPG storage, with a total vaporization capacity of 0.15 Bcf per day.  Yankee Gas owns a 1.2 Bcf LNG facility, which also has the ability to liquefy and vaporize up to 0.1 Bcf per day.  This facility is used primarily to assist Yankee Gas in meeting its supplier-of-last-resort obligations and also enables it to provide economic supply and make economic refill of natural gas, typically during periods of low demand.\n8\nRates\nNSTAR Gas and EGMA are subject to regulation by the DPU and Yankee Gas is subject to regulation by the PURA, both of which, among other things, have jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nRetail natural gas supply and delivery rates are established by the DPU and the PURA and are comprised of:\n•\nA seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause (CGAC) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that collects natural gas supply costs, pipeline and storage capacity costs, costs related to charge-offs of uncollected energy costs and working capital related costs.  The CGAC is reset semi-annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following corresponding season.  In addition, NSTAR Gas and EGMA file interim changes to the CGAC factor when the actual costs of natural gas supply vary from projections by more than five percent.\n•\nA Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause at Yankee Gas that collects the costs of the procurement of natural gas for its firm and seasonal customers. The PGA is evaluated monthly.  Differences between actual natural gas costs and collection amounts from September 1st through August 31st of each PGA year are deferred and then recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following PGA year.  Carrying charges on outstanding balances are calculated using Yankee Gas' weighted average cost of capital in accordance with the directives of the PURA.\n•\nA distribution charge consisting of a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge that collects the costs of building, maintaining, and expanding the natural gas infrastructure to deliver natural gas supply to its customers.  This also includes collection of ongoing operating costs.\n•\nA local distribution adjustment clause (LDAC) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that collects all energy efficiency and related program costs, environmental costs, pension and PBOP related costs, attorney general consultant costs, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, gas system enhancement program (GSEP) costs, costs associated with low income customers, and costs associated with a geothermal pilot program.  The LDAC is reset annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following period and provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers.\n•\nA Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) at Yankee Gas, which allows 100 percent recovery of conservation costs through this mechanism including program incentives to promote energy efficiency.  A reconciliation of CAM revenues to expenses is performed annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers with carrying charges during the following year.\n•\nA Gas System Improvement (GSI) reconciliation mechanism at Yankee Gas, which collects the costs of certain Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP) and core capital plant in service above and beyond the level that is recovered through the distribution charge.  The GSI is adjusted and reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•\nA System Expansion Rate (SER) reconciliation mechanism at Yankee Gas, which compares distribution system expansion investment costs and revenues from system expansion customers with the level projected in current distribution customer rates.  This reconciliation is performed annually and customer rates are adjusted accordingly.\n•\nA Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU.  The pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement is also subject to adjustment in accordance with provisions of the November 2020 NSTAR Gas distribution rate case and the October 2020 EGMA rate settlement agreement.\n•\nA RDM at Yankee Gas that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the PURA.  The pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement is also subject to adjustment in accordance with provisions of the 2018 rate case settlement agreement.\nDistribution Rate Cases and Settlement Agreements\n:  \nNSTAR Gas:  NSTAR Gas distribution rates were established in an October 2020 DPU-approved rate case, with rates effective November 1, 2020.  The DPU also approved a 10-year PBR plan through November 1, 2030, which includes inflation-based adjustments to annual base distribution amounts effective annually beginning November 1, 2021.  For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nEGMA:  EGMA’s distribution rates were established in a DPU-approved October 7, 2020 rate settlement agreement, with rate increases on November 1, 2021 and November 1, 2022, and two rate base resets during an eight-year rate plan.  The first rate base reset occurred on November 1, 2024 and the second will occur November 1, 2027.  Notwithstanding the two distribution rate increases, the two rate base reset provisions, and potential adjustments for qualifying exogenous events, EGMA agreed not to file for an increase or redesign of distribution base rates effective prior to November 1, 2028.  For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n9\nYankee Gas:  Yankee Gas distribution rates were established in a December 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement, with rates effective November 15, 2018.  PURA also approved step adjustments effective January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021.  On November 12, 2024, Yankee Gas filed an application to amend its base distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2025.  A final decision by PURA is expected in October 2025.  For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nService Quality Metrics\n:  NSTAR Gas and EGMA are subject to SQ metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service and each could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics.  NSTAR Gas and EGMA will not be required to pay any SQ charges relating to their 2024 performance.\nNatural Gas Replacement\nMassachusetts:  Pursuant to Massachusetts legislation, in October of each year, NSTAR Gas and EGMA file GSEP Plans with the DPU for the following construction year.  The GSEP Program is designed to accelerate the replacement of certain natural gas distribution facilities in the system to less than 25 years.  The GSEP includes a tariff that provides NSTAR Gas and EGMA an opportunity to collect the costs for the program on an annual basis through a reconciling factor.  On April 30th each year, the DPU approves the GSEP rate recovery factor that goes into effect on May 1st.\nIn October 2020, the DPU opened Docket “DPU 20-80 The Future of Gas” to examine the role of Massachusetts natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs) in helping to meet the state’s 2050 climate goals.  For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nConnecticut:  Yankee Gas' December 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement included an accelerated pipeline replacement cost recovery program.  The GSI rate recovers accelerated pipeline replacement as well as other capital investment through an annual reconciliation.  Yankee Gas files its GSI reconciliation annually on March 1st for rates effective April 1st.\nSources and Availability of Natural Gas Supply\nNSTAR Gas and EGMA maintain flexible resource portfolios consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market area storage and peaking services.  NSTAR Gas and EGMA purchase transportation, storage, and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions in the U.S., including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent region, and Appalachian Shale (as well as Ontario, Canada specific to EGMA), which supply to the final delivery points in the NSTAR Gas and EGMA service areas.  NSTAR Gas purchases all of its natural gas supply under a firm, competitively bid annual portfolio management contract.  EGMA purchases the majority of its natural gas supply under a number of firm, competitively bid annual portfolio management contracts, and manages a portion of its own portfolio.  In addition to the firm transportation and natural gas storage supplies discussed above, NSTAR Gas and EGMA utilize on-system LNG facilities (and also LPG facilities for EGMA) to meet winter peaking demands.  These LNG facilities are located within NSTAR Gas' and EGMA’s distribution systems and are used to liquefy pipeline natural gas and/or receive liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas to be stored during the warmer months for vaporization and use during the heating season.  During the summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity and supplies are used to deliver and store natural gas in market area underground storage facilities located in Maryland and Pennsylvania.  Stored natural gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement flowing pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating demand.  NSTAR Gas has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of approximately 6.6 Bcf, and 3.5 Bcf LNG storage is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp. in facilities located in two different locations in Massachusetts.  EGMA has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of approximately 8.8 Bcf, and 1.8 Bcf LNG and LPG storage is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp. in facilities located at seven different locations in Massachusetts.\nPURA requires Yankee Gas to meet the needs of its firm customers under all weather conditions.  Specifically, Yankee Gas must structure its supply portfolio to meet firm customer needs under a design day scenario (defined as the coldest day in 30 years) and under a design year scenario (defined as the average of the four coldest years in the last 30 years).  Yankee Gas also maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, off-system storage and its on-system 1.2 Bcf LNG storage facility in Connecticut to meet consumption needs during the coldest days of winter.  Yankee Gas obtains its interstate capacity from the three interstate pipelines that directly serve Connecticut: the Algonquin, Tennessee and Iroquois Pipelines, which connect to other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions, including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent, Canadian regions and Appalachian Shale supplies.  \nBased on information currently available regarding projected growth in demand and estimates of availability of future supplies of pipeline natural gas, each of NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas believes that in order to meet the long-term firm customer requirements in a reliable manner, a combination of pipeline, storage, and non-pipeline solutions will be necessary.\n10\nWATER DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nAquarion Company (Aquarion) operates five separate regulated water utilities in Connecticut (Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, or AWC-CT, and The Torrington Water Company), Massachusetts (Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts, or AWC-MA), and New Hampshire (Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire, or AWC-NH, and Abenaki Water Company).  These regulated companies provide water services to approximately 248,000 residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and fire protection and other customers, in 73 towns and cities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately 91 percent of Aquarion’s customers were based in Connecticut.\nRates\nAquarion's water utilities are subject to regulation by the PURA, the DPU and the NHPUC in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively.  These regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over, among other things, rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nAquarion’s general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection services.\nThe rates established by the PURA, DPU and NHPUC are comprised of the following:\n•\nA base rate, which is comprised of fixed charges based on meter/fire connection sizes, as well as volumetric charges based on the amount of water sold.  Together these charges are designed to recover the full cost of service resulting from a general rate proceeding.\n•\nIn Connecticut, a revenue adjustment mechanism (RAM) that reconciles earned revenues, with certain allowed adjustments, on an annual basis, to the revenue requirement approved by PURA.\n•\nIn Connecticut and New Hampshire, a water infrastructure conservation adjustment (WICA) charge, and in Massachusetts, an annual main replacement adjustment mechanism (MRAM) charge, which is applied between rate case proceedings and seeks recovery of allowed costs associated with eligible infrastructure improvement projects placed in-service.  The WICA is updated semi-annually in Connecticut and annually in New Hampshire.  In Connecticut, an annual WICA reconciliation mechanism reconciles earned WICA revenue to the approved WICA revenue with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDistribution Rate Cases\n:\n \nOn August 29, 2022, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut (AWC-CT) filed an application with PURA to amend its existing rate schedules.  On March 15, 2023, PURA issued a final decision that rejected AWC-CT’s application with PURA, which was subsequently appealed by AWC-CT.  On March 25, 2024, the State of Connecticut Superior Court issued a decision on the appeal and on March 28, 2024, AWC-CT filed an appeal of the Connecticut Superior Court decision.  On July 31, 2024, PURA issued a final decision and increased AWC-CT’s approved revenue requirement by $0.1 million above the amount authorized in the March 15, 2023 decision, which was also subsequently appealed by AWC-CT.  Both appeals are pending.  For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAquarion’s Massachusetts base distribution rates were established in a 2018 DPU-approved rate case.  Aquarion's New Hampshire base distribution rates were established in a July 2022 NHPUC-approved rate case settlement agreement, with a single step adjustment approved on January 19, 2023.  Rates were effective March 1, 2023.\nSources and Availability of Water Supply\nOur water utilities obtain their water supplies from owned surface water sources (reservoirs) and groundwater supplies (wells) with a total supply yield of approximately 135 million gallons per day, as well as water purchased from other water suppliers.  Approximately 98 percent of our annual production is self-supplied and processed at ten surface water treatment plants and numerous well stations, which are all located in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.\nThe capacities of Aquarion’s sources of supply, and water treatment, pumping and distribution facilities, are considered sufficient to meet the present requirements of Aquarion’s customers under normal conditions.  On occasion, drought declarations are issued for portions of Aquarion’s service territories in response to extended periods of dry weather conditions. \nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nFor information on capital expenditures and projects during 2024, as well as projected capital expenditures by business, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\n11\nFINANCING\nFor information regarding short-term and long-term debt agreements, see \"Liquidity\" in the accompanying Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \nand Note 8, \"Short-Term Debt,\" and Note 9, \"Long-Term Debt,\" of the Combined Notes to Financial Statements.\nNUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and several other New England electric utilities are stockholders in three inactive regional nuclear generation companies, CYAPC, MYAPC and YAEC (collectively, the Yankee Companies).  The Yankee Companies have completed the physical decommissioning of their respective nuclear power facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent nuclear fuel.  The Yankee Companies fund these costs through litigation proceeds received from the DOE and, to the extent necessary, through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in turn recover these costs from their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates.  The Yankee Companies collect amounts that we believe are adequate to recover the remaining plant closure and fuel storage cost estimates for the respective plants.  We believe CL&P and NSTAR Electric will recover their shares of these obligations from their customers.  PSNH has recovered its total share of these costs from its customers.\nWe consolidate the assets and obligations of CYAPC and YAEC on our consolidated balance sheet because our ownership and voting interests are greater than 50 percent of each of these companies.  \nOTHER REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nGeneral\nWe are regulated by various federal and state agencies, including FERC, the SEC, and various state and/or local regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the industry and the service areas in which each of our companies operates, including the PURA, which has jurisdiction over CL&P, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion, the DPU, which has jurisdiction over NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Aquarion, and the NHPUC, which has jurisdiction over PSNH and Aquarion. \nRenewable Portfolio Standards\nEach of the states in which we do business has Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) requirements, which generally require fixed percentages of our energy supply to come from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, landfill gas, fuel cells and other similar sources.\nConnecticut's RPS statute requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources.  In 2024, the total RPS obligation was 37.0 percent and will ultimately reach 48.0 percent in 2030.  CL&P is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with RPS from its customers through its generation service charge rate.\nMassachusetts' RPS program requires electricity suppliers to meet renewable energy standards.  For 2024, the RPS and Clean Energy Standard (CES) requirements were 62.3 percent, and will ultimately reach 63.1 percent in 2025.  Massachusetts electric suppliers were also required to meet Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (APS) of 6.0 percent and Clean Peak Energy Standards (CPS) of 4.0 percent in 2024.  Those requirements will reach 6.25 and 5.5 percent in 2025, respectively.  NSTAR Electric is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with these requirements from its customers through rates.  NSTAR Electric also owns renewable solar power facilities.  The RECs generated from NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities are sold to other energy suppliers, and the proceeds from these sales are credited back to customers.\nNew Hampshire's RPS provision requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources.  In 2024, the total RPS obligation was 24.3 percent and it will ultimately reach 25.2 percent in 2025.  The costs of the RECs are recovered by PSNH through rates charged to customers.\nEnvironmental Regulation and Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental legislation and regulation with respect to water quality, air quality, natural/working lands (wetlands, water resource areas that include land that borders a body of water, plant/animal habitat), hazardous materials and other environmental matters.  Our environmental policy includes formal procedures and a task-scheduling system in place to help ensure environmental compliance.  The Governance, Environmental and Social Responsibility Committee of Eversource’s Board of Trustees also provides oversight of climate issues, environmental matters and compliance.  We also identify and address potential environmental risks through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program in addition to rigorous audits of our facilities, vendors, and processes.\nAdditionally, projects may not be constructed or significantly modified without a review of the environmental impact of the proposed construction or modification by the applicable federal or state agencies.  Many of our construction projects require the submission of comprehensive permitting applications to various local, state and federal agencies.  The permits we receive outline various best management practices and restoration requirements to address construction period-impacts.     \n12\nWe have recorded a liability for what we believe, based upon currently available information, is our reasonably estimable environmental investigation, remediation, and/or natural resource damages costs for waste disposal sites for which we have probable liability.  Under federal and state law, government agencies and private parties can attempt to impose liability on us for recovery of investigation and remediation costs at contaminated sites.  As of December 31, 2024, the liability recorded for our reasonably estimable and probable environmental remediation costs for known sites needing investigation and/or remediation, exclusive of recoveries from insurance or from third parties, was $128.0 million, representing 65 sites.  These costs could be significantly higher if additional remediation becomes necessary or when additional information as to the extent of contamination becomes available.\nThe most significant liabilities currently relate to future clean-up costs at former MGP facilities.  These facilities were owned and operated by our predecessor companies from the mid-1800's to mid-1900's.  By-products from the manufacture of natural gas using coal resulted in fuel oils, hydrocarbons, coal tar, purifier wastes, metals and other waste products that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment.  We currently have partial or full ownership responsibilities at former MGP sites that have a reserve balance of $115.9 million of the total $128.0 million as of December 31, 2024.  MGP costs are recoverable through rates charged to our customers.\nWhen planning environmental investigations and remediation of impacted properties, we work closely with the municipalities and environmental regulators to ensure that our remediation plans adhere to applicable regulations while protecting human health and the environment.  In many cases, these remediation projects are designed to address opportunities for beneficial reuse of the property. \nGlobal Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emission Issues\nEversource assesses the regulatory, physical and transitional impacts related to climate change to develop mitigation strategies including evaluating the impacts of more severe and frequent weather events, financial risks, changing customer behaviors, and opportunities to reduce emissions in our operations and for the region through clean energy and emerging technologies investments.\nRegulatory Impacts of Climate Change: \n Global climate change has received focus from the federal and state governments.  Some of the states in which we operate have aggressive climate goals and implementation plans.  In Connecticut, legislation includes a target to achieve zero-carbon electricity by 2040.  In response to the 2021 Massachusetts climate legislation calling for increased electrification of the transportation and building sectors, in 2023, Eversource developed an Electric Sector Modernization Plan (ESMP) detailing steps the Company will take over the next five and ten years to help ensure reliability and resiliency while supporting a clean energy future.  Approved by the DPU in 2024, the ESMP includes incremental spending for interconnections of clean energy and resiliency initiatives and corresponding cost recovery will be established in 2025.  Similarly, the Massachusetts “Future of Gas” docket (DPU 20-80) specified measures for natural gas local distribution companies to support the state’s net zero by 2050 climate goal.  These state regulations and related policies may introduce risks and opportunities to our businesses if demands for energy change.  The prior administration had communicated a strong focus on addressing climate change by setting a U.S. target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 economy-wide.  The plan called for aggressive measures focused on clean transportation, clean energy and climate investments targeted at environmental justice communities.  In support of this plan, federal funding and incentive programs for clean transportation and energy have offered opportunities for Eversource to invest in projects that have the ability to reduce emissions in the region while benefiting our communities and shareholders.  Under the new administration there is uncertainty about the future of this funding and other clean energy policies, and the potential impact it may have on future projects. In addition, the states we operate in may respond to the federal policy shift with enhancements to existing clean energy programs, creating additional opportunities. \nEversource continually evaluates the evolving regulatory landscape concerning climate change, which could potentially lead to additional requirements, rules and regulations that could impact how we operate our businesses.  Potential future environmental statutes, regulations, policies and reporting metrics for rate cases that address climate change could impose significant additional costs and there can be no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of those costs. \nPhysical and Transitional Impacts of Climate Change:  \nEversource assesses the physical impacts of climate change that are presented in the form of weather or natural events or due to longer-term shifts in climate patterns, as well as transitional impacts related to a shift to a lower-carbon economy and changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements.  To address physical and transitional impacts related to climate change, maintain resiliency across our system, and enable potential opportunities for our business, we are pursuing the following actions:\n•\nImproving our system resiliency in response to climate change through vegetation management, pole and wire strengthening, flood proofing, and other system hardening measures; \n•\nConducting climate modeling to assess vulnerable regions and infrastructure in order to prioritize hazard mitigation projects;\n•\nImplementing a grid modernization plan that will enhance our electric distribution infrastructure to improve resiliency and reliability and increase opportunities to facilitate integration of distributed energy resources, electric vehicle infrastructure, and electrification of building heat;\n•\nFocusing on improving the efficiency of our electric and natural gas distribution systems, preparing for increased opportunities that clean energy advancements create, and providing customers with ways to optimize their energy efficiency; \n•\nPursuing new technologies and incentives for decarbonization of energy in the sectors that both we and our customers operate in;\n•\nEvaluating opportunities for our natural gas system and exploring alternative, less carbon-intensive technologies like networked geothermal for heating and cooling; and\n•\nInvestigating emerging technologies such as energy storage and automation programs that improve reliability.\n13\nPhysical risks from climate change may be acute due to increased severity of extreme weather events or chronic due to changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns, rising mean temperatures and/or rising sea levels and shifting weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, extreme heat, more frequent and severe storms, droughts, wildfires and floods.  These risks may result in customers’ energy and water usage increasing or decreasing depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, degradation of water quality and our ability to reliably deliver our services to customers.  Severe weather may cause outages, potential disruption of operations and property damage to our assets.\nOur actions to improve system reliability and resiliency allow our business to operate under changing conditions and meet customer expectations.  System improvements are designed to withstand severe weather impacts and include installing new and stronger infrastructure like poles, wires and related system equipment, as well as enhanced year-round tree trimming.  We are reinforcing existing critical facilities to withstand storm surges and future substations are being “flood hardened” to better protect our system against storm surges associated with the increasing risk of severe weather in the states that support this work.  We created our comprehensive emergency preparedness and response plans in partnership with state and community leaders so that when a storm occurs, we can provide customers and municipalities with timely and accurate information, while safely and promptly restoring power.  Additionally, we collaborate with other utility providers and industry partners across the country to better understand storm hazards and develop solutions to improve our system reliability.\nEversource set a GHG reduction goal in 2019 to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations and reach carbon neutrality by 2030.  This goal addresses emissions from our operations primarily in the form of line loss (emissions associated with the energy lost when power is transmitted and distributed across the electric system), methane leaks from our natural gas distribution system, fuel consumption from our facilities and vehicle fleet, and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leaks from electric equipment.  Initiatives to reduce GHG emissions have resulted in a 30% reduction in emission from 2018 to 2023 from initiatives including improved energy efficiency at our buildings, utilizing alternative fuels and introducing more hybrid and electric vehicles into the company fleet, reducing fugitive emissions of methane by replacing leak-prone natural gas pipes, improving maintenance of SF6 gas-insulated electrical equipment, and piloting innovative SF6-free technologies thereby reducing SF6 emissions and supporting the overall interconnection of clean energy to the region thereby helping reduce the carbon intensity of line losses across the electric grid.  Progress towards this target is reported at least annually through a third-party-verified GHG emission inventory.  We are also looking to introduce an expanded target that will place a greater emphasis on the indirect Scope 3 emissions from our customers’ energy use.  An expanded target that aligns with the climate policies and regulations of the states where we operate will be introduced in early 2025.\nOur business is also exposed to climate-related transitional impacts, such as policy, legal and reputational impacts and technology and market changes as we enable broad decarbonization of the electrical and building sectors in support of regional policies and targets.  We actively support local, state and federal emission reduction goals to address climate change and pursue climate-related opportunities that enable continued business success while serving the needs of our customers.  Our investments help reduce regional emissions while improving shareholder value.  Meanwhile, our energy efficiency solutions and electric vehicle infrastructure investments allow our customers to make choices that minimize climate-related impacts. \nAdditionally, as our business transitions to support a more energy diverse economy, human capital needs will also change with the potential to impact our workforce.  As new technologies are implemented, we will need to recruit, develop and possibly retrain employees to meet the need for new skill sets.  \nElectric and Magnetic Fields  \nFor more than forty years, published reports have discussed the possibility of adverse health effects from electric and magnetic fields (EMF) associated with electric transmission and distribution facilities, including appliances, and wiring in buildings and homes.  Some epidemiology studies have reported a possible statistical association between adverse health effects and exposure with EMF.  The association identified in some of these studies remain unexplained and inconclusive.  Numerous scientific review panels, considering all significant EMF epidemiology and laboratory studies, have concluded that the available body of scientific information does not support a conclusion that EMF affects human health at levels expected in the vicinity.  In accordance with recommendations of various regulatory bodies and public health organizations, we use design principles that help reduce potential EMF exposures associated with new transmission lines.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEversource is committed to delivering reliable energy and superior customer service; expanding energy options for our region; environmental stewardship; a safe and fairly compensated workforce; and community service and leadership.  Our employees are critical to achieving this mission and we recognize the importance of attracting, retaining, and developing the most qualified individuals and ensuring fairness and equal employment opportunity for all.  Leaders at all levels strive to create a workplace where our employees are engaged, empowered, advocate for the customer, work collaboratively, raise ideas for improvement and focus on delivering superior customer experience.  We build employee engagement through continuous communication, talent development, and fostering teamwork.  We have established metrics and annual goals on our corporate scorecard, including safety performance, talent management and employee engagement, that drive accountability for progress across the business.    \nAs of December 31, 2024, Eversource Energy employed a total of 10,680 employees, excluding temporary employees, of which 1,599 were employed by CL&P, 2,185 were employed by NSTAR Electric, and 848 were employed by PSNH.  In addition, 4,286 were employed by Eversource Service, Eversource's service company, that provides support services to all Eversource operating companies.  Approximately 48 percent of our employees are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Utility Workers Union of America or The United Steelworkers, and are covered by various collective bargaining agreements.\n14\nSafety.\n  At Eversource, our commitment to “Safety First and Always” is a principle and a mindset present in every job and every task, whether in the field, office or at home.  A priority at Eversource is continuous improvement and safety is at the forefront as we continue to build a strong safety culture, embrace new technologies, and learn with our industry and community partners to improve safety performance.  We provide safety training and perform field safety job observations of both internal and contractor crews with a focus on high-energy hazards.  We use metrics such as Days Away Restricted Time (DART) and High Energy Field Observations, among others, to monitor safety performance.  Our DART safety performance was 0.76 in 2024, measured by days away, restricted or transferred per 100 workers, using the DART-OSHA method of measurement.\nEngagement.\n  We believe an engaged workforce and culture of respect contribute to our success and sustainability by driving innovation and creating trusted relationships with our employees, customers, suppliers, and community partners.

Unless expressly stated otherwise, for discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2022 items and of fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, please refer to Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\n in our combined 2023\n \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\n, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nRefer to the Glossary of Terms included in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.  \nThe only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource.  Our earnings discussion includes financial measures that are not recognized under GAAP (non-GAAP) referencing our earnings and EPS excluding losses on the sales and impairments of the offshore wind equity method investments, a loss on the pending sale of the Aquarion water distribution business, a loss on the disposition of land that was initially acquired to construct the Northern Pass Transmission project and was subsequently abandoned, and certain transaction and transition costs.  EPS by business is also a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing the Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource common shares outstanding for the period. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of such business, but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. \nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain our results without including these items.  This information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance and planning and forecasting of future periods.  We believe the impacts of the losses on the offshore wind equity method investments, the loss on the pending sale of the Aquarion water distribution business, the loss on the disposition of land associated with an abandoned project, and transaction and transition costs are not indicative of our ongoing costs and performance.  We view these charges as not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and therefore not an indicator of baseline operating performance.  Due to the nature and significance of the effect of these items on Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders and EPS, we believe that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of our financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance of our business.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to reported Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of operating performance.\nFinancial Condition and Business Analysis\nExecutive Summary\nEversource Energy is a public utility holding company primarily engaged, through its wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries, in the energy delivery business.  Eversource Energy's wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries consist of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH (electric utilities), Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA (natural gas utilities) and Aquarion (water utilities).  Eversource is organized into the electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution, and water distribution reportable segments. \nThe following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nEarnings Overview and Future Outlook:\n•\nWe earned $811.7 million, or $2.27 per share, in 2024, compared with a loss of $442.2 million, or $1.26 per share, in 2023.  Our 2024 results include an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sales of our offshore wind investments of $524.0 million, or $1.47 per share, and an after-tax loss resulting from the expected sale of Aquarion of $298.3 million, or $0.83 per share.  Our 2023 results included after-tax impairment charges on our offshore wind investments of $1.95 billion, or $5.58 per share.  Our 2023 results also included after-tax land abandonment and other charges of $6.9 million, or $0.02 per share.  Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.63 billion, or $4.57 per share, in 2024, compared with non-GAAP earnings of $1.52 billion, or $4.34 per share, in 2023.\n•\nWe project that we will earn within a 2025 earning guidance range of between $4.67 per share and $4.82 per share.  We also project that our long-term EPS growth rate through 2029 will be in a 5 to 7 percent range, using 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $4.57 per share as the base year. \nLiquidity:\n•\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.16 billion in 2024, compared with $1.65 billion in 2023.  Investments in property, plant and equipment totaled $4.48 billion in 2024, compared with $4.34 billion in 2023.  \n29\n•\nCash totaled $26.7 million as of December 31, 2024, compared with $53.9 million as of December 31, 2023.  Our available borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs totaled $607.2 million as of December 31, 2024.  \n•\nIn 2024, we issued $4.50 billion of new long-term debt and we repaid $1.95 billion of long-term debt.\n•\nIn 2024, we paid dividends totaling $2.86 per common share, compared with dividends of $2.70 per common share in 2023.  Our quarterly common share dividend payment was $0.715 per share in 2024, as compared to $0.675 per share in 2023.  On January 29, 2025, our Board of Trustees approved a common share dividend payment of $0.7525 per share, payable on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2025.\n•\nWe project to make capital expenditures of $24.17 billion from 2025 through 2029, of which we expect $10.22 billion to be in our electric distribution segment, $6.00 billion to be in our natural gas distribution segment, and $6.81 billion to be in our electric transmission segment.  We also project to invest $1.15 billion in information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements.\nStrategic Developments:\n•\nOn January 27, 2025, Eversource entered into a definitive agreement to sell Aquarion.  Subject to certain closing adjustments, the aggregate enterprise value of the sale is approximately $2.4 billion in cash, which includes approximately $1.6 billion for the equity and $800 million of net debt that will be extinguished at closing.  The sale is subject to regulatory and other approvals and is expected to close in late 2025.  Eversource plans to use the net proceeds from the pending sale to pay down parent company debt.\n•\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its 50 percent ownership share in the Sunrise Wind project to Ørsted for adjusted proceeds of $152 million and completed the sale of its 50 percent ownership share in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to GIP for adjusted gross proceeds of $745 million.  Eversource recognized an aggregate net after-tax loss on the sales of its offshore wind investments of $524 million.  Eversource recorded a contingent liability of $365 million, reflecting its estimate of the future obligations under the GIP sale terms, which include an expected cost overrun sharing obligation, expected obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return, and obligation for other future costs.  Eversource does not have any ongoing financial obligations associated with Sunrise Wind. \nEarnings Overview\nConsolidated:\n  Below is a summary of our earnings/(loss) by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders and diluted EPS.\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts)\nAmount\nPer Share\nAmount\nPer Share\nAmount\nPer Share\nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n811.7 \n$\n2.27 \n$\n(442.2)\n$\n(1.26)\n$\n1,404.9 \n$\n4.05 \nRegulated Companies (Non-GAAP)\n$\n1,691.9 \n$\n4.73 \n$\n1,509.3 \n$\n4.31 \n$\n1,460.4 \n$\n4.21 \nEversource Parent and Other Companies (Non-GAAP)\n(57.9)\n(0.16)\n8.4 \n0.03 \n(40.5)\n(0.12)\nNon-GAAP Earnings\n$\n1,634.0 \n$\n4.57 \n$\n1,517.7 \n$\n4.34 \n$\n1,419.9 \n$\n4.09 \nLosses on Offshore Wind Investments (after-tax) \n(1)\n(524.0)\n(1.47)\n(1,953.0)\n(5.58)\n— \n— \nLoss on Pending Sale of Aquarion (after-tax) \n(2)\n(298.3)\n(0.83)\n— \n— \n— \n— \nLand Abandonment Loss and Other Charges (after-tax) \n(3)\n— \n— \n(6.9)\n(0.02)\n— \n— \nTransaction and Transition Costs (after-tax) \n(4)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n(15.0)\n(0.04)\nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n811.7 \n$\n2.27 \n$\n(442.2)\n$\n(1.26)\n$\n1,404.9 \n$\n4.05 \n(1)    \nIn 2024, we recorded a loss on the sales of our offshore wind equity method investments.

Those earnings increases were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs, higher interest expense, higher depreciation expense, the absence of a prior year benefit at PSNH related to the establishment of a new regulatory tracking mechanism that allowed for the recovery of previously incurred operating expenses associated with poles acquired on May 1, 2023, higher property tax expense, and a higher effective tax rate.\n \nOur electric transmission segment earnings increased $81.2 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and the impact of the annual rate reconciliation filing with FERC, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. \nOur natural gas distribution segment earnings increased $66.2 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher revenues from base distribution rate increases effective November 1, 2024 at EGMA and effective November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2023 at NSTAR Gas and capital tracking mechanisms due to continued investments in natural gas infrastructure.  Earnings also benefited from lower operations and maintenance expense, the absence of a prior year unfavorable regulatory adjustment resulting from NSTAR Gas’ GSEP reconciliation filing, and a lower effective tax rate.  Those earnings increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense, and higher property tax expense.\nOur water distribution segment recognized a $297 million impairment charge in 2024 as a result of writing down the carrying value of the business to fair value due to the expected sale of Aquarion.  Excluding the impairment charge and transaction costs associated with the expected sale, water distribution segment earnings increased $11.5 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to an after-tax benefit of $11.6 million recorded in 2024 to recognize the impacts of the Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut’s rate case decision from PURA.  The impacts of PURA’s rate case decision on March 15, 2023 were recorded beginning in March 2024 as a result of the State of Connecticut Superior Court’s decision on the rate case appeal on March 25, 2024.  The impacts primarily include a reduction to depreciation expense to reflect lower depreciation rates ordered by PURA in its final decision, partially offset by lower authorized revenues. \nEversource Parent and Other Companies:\n  Eversource parent and other companies’ losses decreased $1.37 billion in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to the loss on the sale of Eversource parent’s offshore wind investments in 2024, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $524.0 million, as compared to an impairment charge on these investments in 2023 of $1.95 billion.  Results for 2023 also include a loss on the disposition of land that was initially acquired to construct the Northern Pass Transmission project and was subsequently abandoned and other charges recorded of $6.9 million.  Excluding these charges, Eversource parent and other companies earnings decreased by $66.3 million due primarily to higher interest expense and the absence of a benefit in 2023 from the liquidation of Eversource parent’s equity method investment in a renewable energy fund, partially offset by the absence of a charitable contribution made in 2023 with a portion of the proceeds from the liquidation, and a lower effective tax rate.\nLiquidity\nSources and Uses of Cash:\n  Eversource’s regulated business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources.  Eversource’s regulated companies’ capital resources are provided by cash flows generated from operations, short-term borrowings, long-term debt issuances, capital contributions from Eversource parent, and existing cash, and are used to fund their liquidity and capital requirements.  Eversource’s regulated companies typically maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements.  Short-term borrowings are also used as a bridge to long-term debt financings.  The levels of short-term borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations (including timing of storm costs and regulatory recoveries), dividends paid, capital contributions received and the timing of long-term debt financings.\n31\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each uses its available capital resources to fund its respective construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay operating costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends, and fund corporate obligations.  Eversource's regulated companies recover their electric, natural gas and water distribution construction expenditures as the related project costs are depreciated over the life of the assets.  This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity and debt used to finance the investments.  Eversource's regulated companies spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period.  These factors have resulted in current liabilities exceeding current assets by $1.64 billion, $291.7 million and $112.0 million at Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. \nWe expect the future operating cash flows of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, along with our existing borrowing availability and access to both debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet any working capital and future operating requirements, and capital investment forecasted opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $1.40 billion of Eversource's long-term debt, including $600.0 million at Eversource parent, $400.0 million at CL&P and $250.0 million at NSTAR Electric, matures within the next 12 months.  Eversource, with its current credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt.  Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH will reduce their short-term borrowings with operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, determined by considering capital requirements and maintenance of Eversource's credit rating and profile.  \nEversource is currently in the process of selling its Aquarion water distribution business.  For information regarding the pending sale and use of proceeds, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Pending Sale of Aquarion\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nCash totaled $26.7 million as of December 31, 2024, compared with $53.9 million as of December 31, 2023.\nShort-Term Debt - Commercial Paper Programs and Credit Agreements\n:  Eversource parent has a $2.00 billion commercial paper program allowing Eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, EGMA and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut are parties to a five-year $2.00 billion revolving credit facility, which terminates on October 11, 2029.  This\n re\nvolving credit facility serves to backstop Eversource parent's $2.00 billion commercial paper program.\nNSTAR Electric has a $650 million commercial paper program allowing NSTAR Electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  NSTAR Electric is also a party to a five-year $650 million revolving credit facility, which terminates on October 11, 2029, that serves to backstop NSTAR Electric's $650 million commercial paper program.\nThe amount of borrowings outstanding and available under the commercial paper programs were as follows:\nBorrowings Outstanding\n as of December 31,\nAvailable Borrowing Capacity as of December 31,\nWeighted-Average Interest Rate as of December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nEversource Parent Commercial Paper Program \n$\n1,538.0 \n$\n1,771.9 \n$\n462.0 \n$\n228.1 \n4.76 \n%\n5.60 \n%\nNSTAR Electric Commercial Paper Program \n504.8 \n365.8 \n145.2 \n284.2 \n4.55 \n%\n5.40 \n%\nThere were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nCL&P and PSNH have uncommitted line of credit agreements totaling $375 million and $250 million, respectively, all of which will expire in either May 2025, September 2025 or October 2025.  There are no borrowings outstanding on either the CL&P or PSNH uncommitted line of credit agreements as of December 31, 2024.\nAmounts outstanding under the commercial paper programs are included in Notes Payable and classified in current liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets, as all borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time.  As a result of the CL&P long-term debt issuance in January 2024, $207.3 million of commercial paper borrowings under the Eversource parent commercial paper program were reclassified to Long-Term Debt on Eversource parent’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.  \nIntercompany Borrowings:\n  Eversource parent uses its available capital resources to provide loans to its subsidiaries to assist in meeting their short-term borrowing needs.  Eversource parent records intercompany interest income from its loans to subsidiaries, which is eliminated in consolidation.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent to its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation on Eversource's balance sheets.  As of December 31, 2024, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $280.0 million and to PSNH of $131.1 million.  As of December 31, 2023, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $457.0 million and to PSNH of $233.0 million.  Eversource parent charges interest on these intercompany loans at the same weighted-average interest rate as its commercial paper program.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent are included in Notes Payable to Eversource Parent and classified in current liabilities on the respective subsidiary's balance sheets, as these intercompany borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time.  As a result of the CL&P long-term debt issuance in January 2024, $207.3 million of CL&P’s intercompany borrowings were reclassified to Long-Term Debt on CL&P’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. \n32\nAvailability under Long-Term Debt Issuance Authorizations:  \nOn May 1, 2024, the DPU approved NSTAR Electric’s request for authorization to issue up to $2.40 billion in long-term debt through December 31, 2026.  On July 24, 2024, PURA approved CL&P’s request for authorization to issue up to $1.00 billion in long-term debt through December 31, 2025.

On January 28, 2025, Yankee Gas submitted an application to PURA requesting authorization to issue up to $360 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2026.  PSNH has utilized its long-term debt authorizations in place with NHPUC.\nLong-Term Debt Issuances and Repayments:\n \nThe following table summarizes long-term debt issuances and repayments:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nInterest Rate\nIssuance/\n(Repayment)\nIssue Date or Repayment Date\nMaturity Date\nUse of Proceeds for Issuance/\nRepayment Information\nCL&P 2024 Series A First Mortgage Bonds \n4.65 \n%\n$\n350.0 \nJanuary 2024\nJanuary 2029\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures and working capital \nCL&P Series B First Mortgage Bonds\n4.95 \n%\n300.0 \nAugust 2024\nAugust 2034\nRepaid Series D Bonds, repaid short-term debt, and working capital\nCL&P Series D First Mortgage Bonds\n7.875 \n%\n(139.8)\nOctober 2024\nOctober 2024\nPaid at maturity\nCL&P 2025 Series A First Mortgage Bonds\n4.95 \n%\n400.0 \nJanuary 2025\nJanuary 2030\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures and working capital\nNSTAR Electric Debentures\n5.40 \n%\n600.0 \nMay 2024\nJune 2034\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures and working capital\nPSNH Series X First Mortgage Bonds\n5.35 \n%\n300.0 \nApril 2024\nOctober 2033\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures and working capital\nEversource Parent Series DD Senior Notes\n5.00 \n%\n350.0 \nJanuary 2024\nJanuary 2027\nRepaid short-term debt\nEversource Parent Series EE Senior Notes\n5.50 \n%\n650.0 \nJanuary 2024\nJanuary 2034\nRepaid short-term debt\nEversource Parent Series FF Senior Notes\n5.85 \n%\n700.0 \nApril 2024\nApril 2031\nRepaid Series X Senior Notes and Aquarion’s 2014 Senior Notes at maturity and short-term debt\nEversource Parent Series GG Senior Notes\n5.95 \n%\n700.0 \nApril 2024\nJuly 2034\nRepaid Series X Senior Notes and Aquarion’s 2014 Senior Notes at maturity and short-term debt\nEversource Parent Series X Senior Notes\n4.20 \n%\n(900.0)\nJune 2024\nJune 2024\nPaid at maturity\nEversource Parent Series L Senior Notes\n2.90 \n%\n(450.0)\nOctober 2024\nOctober 2024\nPaid at maturity\nEversource Parent Series H Senior Notes\n3.15 \n%\n(300.0)\nJanuary 2025\nJanuary 2025\nPaid at maturity\nNSTAR Gas Series W First Mortgage Bonds\n5.29 \n%\n160.0 \nJune 2024\nJune 2029\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures and general corporate purposes\nNSTAR Gas Series X First Mortgage Bonds\n5.48 \n%\n40.0 \nJune 2024\nJune 2034\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures and general corporate purposes\nYankee Gas Series W First Mortgage Bonds\n5.50 \n%\n90.0 \nJuly 2024\nJuly 2029\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures, working capital and repaid Series P bonds at maturity\nYankee Gas Series X First Mortgage Bonds\n5.74 \n%\n90.0 \nJuly 2024\nJuly 2034\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures, working capital and repaid Series P bonds at maturity\nYankee Gas Series P First Mortgage Bonds\n2.23 \n%\n(100.0)\nOctober 2024\nOctober 2024\nPaid at maturity\nEGMA Series E First Mortgage Bonds\n5.17 \n%\n100.0 \nOctober 2024\nNovember 2034\nRefinanced existing indebtedness, paid capital expenditures and general corporate purposes\nAquarion Senior Notes\n4.00 \n%\n(360.0)\nAugust 2024\nAugust 2024\nPaid at maturity\nAquarion Water Company of Connecticut Senior Notes\n5.57 \n%\n70.0 \nAugust 2024\nSeptember 2034\nRepaid short-term debt, paid capital expenditures and general corporate purposes\nAs a result of the CL&P long-term debt issuance in January 2025, $397.1 million of current portion of long-term debt was reclassified to Long-Term Debt on Eversource’s and CL&P’s balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.  \nRate Reduction Bonds:  \nPSNH's RRB payments consist of principal and interest and are paid semi-annually.  PSNH paid $43.2 million of RRB principal payments in each of 2024 and 2023, and paid $14.9 million and $16.2 million of interest payments in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCommon Share Issuances:  \nEversource had an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which it could offer and sell up to $1.2 billion of its common shares from time to time through an “at-the-market” (ATM) equity offering program.  In 2024, Eversource issued 15,740,294 common shares, which resulted in proceeds of $989.4 million, net of issuance costs.  Eversource used the net proceeds received for general corporate purposes.  In 2023, \nno\n shares were issued under this agreement.  Eversource completed the program in October 2024. \n33\nCash Flows:\n  Cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity, and the distribution of natural gas and water.  Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.16 billion in 2024, compared with $1.65 billion in 2023.  Operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable, a $108.8 million increase due to income tax refunds received in 2024 as compared to income tax payments made in 2023, an improvement in regulatory under-recoveries driven primarily by the timing of collections for the CL&P non-bypassable FMCC and other regulatory tracking mechanisms partially offset by the unfavorable impact in the timing of collections for energy supply costs, a $20.7 million decrease in cost of removal expenditures, a $12.4 million decrease in cash payments to vendors for storm costs, and the timing of other working capital items.  The impacts of regulatory collections are included in both Regulatory Recoveries and Amortization on the statements of cash flows.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable.\nIn 2024, we paid cash dividends of $1.00 billion and issued non-cash dividends of $23.5 million\n \nin the form of treasury shares, totaling dividends of $1.03 billion, or $2.86 per common share.  In 2023, we paid cash dividends of $919.0 million and issued non-cash dividends of $23.4 million in the form of treasury shares, totaling dividends of $942.4 million, or $2.70 per common share.  Our quarterly common share dividend payment was $0.715 per share in 2024, as compared to $0.675 per share in 2023.  On January 29, 2025, our Board of Trustees approved a common share dividend payment of $0.7525 per share, payable on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2025.\nEversource issues treasury shares to satisfy awards under the Company's incentive plans, shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, and matching contributions under the Eversource 401k Plan.\nIn 2024, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH paid $333.8 million, $643.9 million and $62.0 million, respectively, in common stock dividends to Eversource parent. \nInvestments in Property, Plant and Equipment on the statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP income/expense.  In 2024, investments for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, and PSNH were $4.48 billion, $978.5 million, $1.56 billion and $608.8 million, respectively.  Capital expenditures were primarily for continuing projects to maintain and improve infrastructure and operations, including enhancing reliability to the transmission and distribution systems.\n \nContractual Obligations:  \nFor information regarding our cash requirements from contractual obligations and payment schedules, see Note 9, \"Long-Term Debt,\" Note 10, \"Rate Reduction Bonds and Variable Interest Entities,\" Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" and Note 14, \"Leases,\" to the financial statements.  \nEstimated interest payments on existing long-term fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement as of December 31, 2024 and are as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nEversource\n$\n1,113.5 \n$\n1,044.2 \n$\n982.4 \n$\n872.3 \n$\n764.4 \n$\n6,793.6 \n$\n11,570.4 \nOur commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual obligations include other liabilities reflected on our balance sheets, and guarantees of certain obligations primarily associated with construction of our previously owned offshore wind investments.\nFor information regarding our projected capital expenditures over the next five years, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Projected Capital Expenditures\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nCredit Ratings:\n  A summary of our current corporate credit ratings and outlooks by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch is as follows:\n \nS&P\nMoody's\nFitch\n \nCurrent\nOutlook\nCurrent\nOutlook\nCurrent\nOutlook\nEversource Parent\nBBB+\nStable\nBaa2\nNegative\nBBB\nStable\nCL&P\nA-\nStable\nA3\nNegative\nA- \nStable\nNSTAR Electric\nA-\nStable\nA2\nNegative\nA-\nStable\nPSNH\nA-\nStable\nA3\nStable\nA-\nStable\nA summary of the current credit ratings and outlooks by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch for senior unsecured debt of Eversource parent and NSTAR Electric, and senior secured debt of CL&P and PSNH is as follows:\n \nS&P\nMoody's\nFitch\n \nCurrent\nOutlook\nCurrent\nOutlook\nCurrent\nOutlook\nEversource Parent\nBBB\nStable\nBaa2\nNegative\nBBB\nStable\nCL&P\nA\nStable\nA1\nNegative\nA+\nStable\nNSTAR Electric\nA-\nStable\nA2\nNegative\nA\nStable\nPSNH\nA\nStable\nA1\nStable\nA+ \nStable\n34\nIn June 2024, Moody’s revised the outlook from stable to negative for CL&P citing a weaker financial profile and a challenging Connecticut regulatory environment.  In December 2024, S&P downgraded the ratings for Eversource parent and its subsidiaries primarily due to S&P's negative assessment of the Connecticut regulatory construct for Eversource’s Connecticut utilities.  These credit ratings and outlook changes reflect higher regulatory risk in Connecticut with the regulatory construct and adverse regulatory developments, including recent rate orders and the passage of Senate Bill 7, negatively impacting the credit quality of Eversource and its subsidiaries.  \nBusiness Development and Capital Expenditures\nOur consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP income/expense (all of which are non-cash factors), totaled $4.64 billion in 2024, $4.59 billion in 2023, and $3.79 billion in 2022.  These amounts included $260.5 million in 2024, $214.4 million in 2023, and $266.5 million in 2022 related to information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements, primarily at Eversource Service and The Rocky River Realty Company.\nElectric Transmission Business:  \nOur consolidated electric transmission business capital expenditures decreased by $120.0 million in 2024, as compared to 2023.  A summary of electric transmission capital expenditures by company is as follows:  \n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCL&P\n$\n450.0 \n$\n470.4 \n$\n416.8 \nNSTAR Electric\n502.0 \n567.4 \n438.4 \nPSNH\n375.8 \n410.0 \n351.8 \nTotal Electric Transmission\n$\n1,327.8 \n$\n1,447.8 \n$\n1,207.0 \nOur transmission projects are designed to improve the reliability of the electric grid, meet customer demand for power, and strengthen the electric grid's resilience against extreme weather and other safety and security threats.  In Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, our transmission projects include transmission line upgrades, the installation of new transmission interconnection facilities, substations and lines, and transmission substation enhancements.\nGreater Cambridge Energy Program:\n  The Greater Cambridge Energy Program will construct Eversource’s first underground transmission substation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, along with associated transmission and distribution lines.  The project will address the increased electric demand in the region, enhance the resiliency of the transmission system, and ensure a flexible grid to reliably serve customers.  The flexibility to transmit and distribute mixed energy sources will support the decarbonization and electrification goals of both the City of Cambridge and the state of Massachusetts.  The new 115/13.8-kV, 35,000 square foot substation will be located in an underground vault and includes three distribution power transformers supplying thirty-six distribution circuits.  The project also includes five underground duct banks housing eight new 115-kV transmission lines.  The Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approved the project on June 28, 2024.  Additional required environmental permits are expected to be approved by the end of 2025, as well as a license from the MA DEP expected to be approved by the end of the second quarter of 2026.  The initial in-service date for the project is June 2029, which includes two 115-kV transmission lines and the transmission portion of the substation.  The first distribution circuits and substation distribution will be placed in-service by the end of 2029.  The remaining transmission and distribution circuits will be placed in-service throughout 2030 and into 2031.  The total project cost is approximately $1.84 billion, with $1.38 billion allocated for transmission and $460 million for distribution.  As of December 31, 2024, $100.1 million has been spent on the project, with $70 million for transmission and $30.1 million for distribution.\nDistribution Business:\n  A summary of distribution capital expenditures is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n CL&P\n NSTAR Electric\n PSNH\n Total Electric\n Natural Gas\nWater\n Total \n2024\nBasic Business\n$\n298.8 \n$\n471.7 \n$\n136.2 \n$\n906.7 \n$\n226.9 \n$\n21.8 \n$\n1,155.4 \nAging Infrastructure\n161.3 \n365.8 \n65.4 \n592.5 \n743.6 \n140.5 \n1,476.6 \nLoad Growth and Other\n110.6 \n194.3 \n66.4 \n371.3 \n52.3 \n0.8 \n424.4 \nTotal Distribution\n$\n570.7 \n$\n1,031.8 \n$\n268.0 \n$\n1,870.5 \n$\n1,022.8 \n$\n163.1 \n$\n3,056.4 \n2023\nBasic Business\n$\n280.3 \n$\n376.6 \n$\n91.1 \n$\n748.0 \n$\n208.2 \n$\n18.5 \n$\n974.7 \nAging Infrastructure\n260.7 \n310.0 \n86.4 \n657.1 \n719.5 \n142.3 \n1,518.9 \nLoad Growth and Other\n138.0 \n191.3 \n37.2 \n366.5 \n70.1 \n0.9 \n437.5 \nTotal Distribution\n$\n679.0 \n$\n877.9 \n$\n214.7 \n$\n1,771.6 \n$\n997.8 \n$\n161.7 \n$\n2,931.1 \n2022\nBasic Business\n$\n267.8 \n$\n202.4 \n$\n68.6 \n$\n538.8 \n$\n175.2 \n$\n16.8 \n$\n730.8 \nAging Infrastructure\n199.9 \n245.1 \n70.8 \n515.8 \n562.3 \n137.6 \n1,215.7 \nLoad Growth and Other\n90.7 \n177.0 \n31.3 \n299.0 \n66.4 \n0.9 \n366.3 \nTotal Distribution\n$\n558.4 \n$\n624.5 \n$\n170.7 \n$\n1,353.6 \n$\n803.9 \n$\n155.3 \n$\n2,312.8 \n35\nFor the electric distribution business, basic business includes the purchase of meters, tools, vehicles, information technology, transformer replacements, equipment facilities, and the relocation of plant.

Load growth and other reflects growth in our service territory, including improvements of acquisitions, installation of new services, and interconnections of systems.\nPending Sale of Aquarion:\n  In early 2024, Eversource initiated an exploratory assessment of the potential sale of the Aquarion water distribution business.  In December 2024, final bids were received, and Eversource obtained approval from its Board of Trustees to sell the Aquarion water distribution business.  On January 27, 2025, Eversource entered into a definitive agreement to sell Aquarion.  Subject to certain closing adjustments, the aggregate enterprise value of the sale is approximately $2.4 billion in cash, which includes approximately $1.6 billion for the equity and $800 million of net debt that will be extinguished at closing.  The sale is subject to approval by PURA, DPU and the NHPUC, as well as other approvals pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act as well as other customary closing conditions.  The sale is expected to close in late 2025.  Eversource plans to use the net proceeds from the pending sale to pay down parent company debt.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, upon classifying the assets and liabilities as held for sale, Eversource concluded that the likely sale of Aquarion at a loss resulted in the requirement to test water distribution goodwill for impairment.  Eversource performed an impairment test by comparing the fair value of the business to its carrying value and recorded a goodwill impairment of $297 million, as the estimated fair value of the business based on the anticipated sale was less than the carrying value.  The fair value included future cash outflows of approximately $140 million of estimated income taxes as a result of the transaction.  The goodwill impairment charge is presented separately within Operating Income on the Eversource statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nProjected Capital Expenditures:\n \n \nA summary of the projected capital expenditures for the regulated companies' electric transmission and for the total electric distribution and natural gas distribution for 2025 through 2029, including information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements on behalf of the regulated companies, is as follows:\n \nYears\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2025 - 2029 Total\nCL&P Transmission\n$\n441 \n$\n497 \n$\n341 \n$\n269 \n$\n260 \n$\n1,808 \nNSTAR Electric Transmission\n611 \n635 \n675 \n861 \n854 \n3,636 \nPSNH Transmission\n354 \n260 \n347 \n204 \n198 \n1,363 \n  \nTotal Electric Transmission\n1,406 \n1,392 \n1,363 \n1,334 \n1,312 \n6,807 \nElectric Distribution\n1,965 \n2,231 \n2,143 \n1,958 \n1,918 \n10,215 \nNatural Gas Distribution\n1,094 \n1,164 \n1,184 \n1,259 \n1,297 \n5,998 \n  \nTotal Electric and Natural Gas Distribution\n3,059 \n3,395 \n3,327 \n3,217 \n3,215 \n16,213 \nInformation Technology and All Other\n256 \n222 \n222 \n225 \n227 \n1,152 \nTotal\n$\n4,721 \n$\n5,009 \n$\n4,912 \n$\n4,776 \n$\n4,754 \n$\n24,172 \nActual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and years above.\nThe projected capital expenditures reflect a reduction in planned capital expenditures for Connecticut’s electric and natural gas distribution businesses due to regulatory policies in Connecticut that discourage investment, including ensuring the timely recovery of costs and the ability to earn a fair return. The continuing pattern of adverse regulatory outcomes for Connecticut utilities and associated credit downgrades from our credit rating agencies necessitated a reduction to Connecticut’s electric and natural gas distribution projected capital expenditures.  These capital reductions do not impact Eversource’s commitment to safety, reliability, or critical staffing structure. \nProjected capital expenditures for the water distribution business of $130 million are expected until the time of sale in late 2025 and have been factored into the water business impairment recorded as of December 31, 2024.\nOffshore Wind Business:\n  Eversource’s previous offshore wind business included 50 percent ownership interests in each of North East Offshore and South Fork Class B Member, LLC.  During 2024, Eversource sold its interest in these entities, and in doing so, sold its interests in the Revolution Wind project, the South Fork Wind project, and the Sunrise Wind project.  Eversource’s current offshore wind business is now comprised only of a noncontrolling tax equity investment in South Fork Wind through a 100 percent ownership in South Fork Wind Holdings, LLC Class A interests.   \n36\nOn May 25, 2023, Eversource announced that it had completed a strategic review of its offshore wind investments and determined that it would pursue the sale of its offshore wind investments.  On September 7, 2023, Eversource completed the sale of its 50 percent interest in an uncommitted lease area consisting of approximately 175,000 developable acres located 25 miles off the south coast of Massachusetts to Ørsted for $625 million in an all-cash transaction.  \nIn September of 2023, Eversource made a $528 million investment in a tax equity interest for South Fork Wind.  South Fork Wind was restructured as a tax equity investment, with Eversource purchasing 100 percent ownership of a new Class A tax equity membership interest.  This investment will result in Eversource receiving cash flow benefits from investment tax credits (ITC) and other future cash flow benefits as well.  As of December 31, 2024, $459 million of expected investment tax credits and other expected tax benefits were reclassified from the South Fork Wind tax equity investment balance reported in Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates as a decrease in Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes on the Eversource balance sheet, which represented a non-cash reclassification.  As a result of these investment tax credits, Eversource expects lower federal income tax payments from 2025 to 2027.  As of December 31, 2024, the tax equity interest in South Fork Wind totaled $22.2 million. \nOn January 24, 2024, Eversource entered into an agreement with Ørsted to sell Eversource’s 50 percent share of Sunrise Wind, subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals.  On April 18, 2024, Eversource and Ørsted executed an equity and asset purchase agreement and on July 9, 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its 50 percent ownership share of Sunrise Wind to Ørsted.  In accordance with the equity and asset purchase agreement and after adjustment for a reduction in capital spending compared to forecasted amounts, adjusted proceeds totaled $152 million.  Ørsted paid Eversource $118 million at the closing of the sale transaction, which was used to repay parent company debt.  Remaining proceeds of $34 million will be paid after onshore construction is completed and certain other construction milestones are achieved.  The remaining expected proceeds have been recorded in Other Long-Term Assets on Eversource’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.  Eversource recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of Sunrise Wind of $377 million in 2024.  With completion of the sale, Eversource does not have any ongoing financial obligations associated with Sunrise Wind. \nOn February 13, 2024, Eversource executed an agreement to sell its 50 percent interests in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for an initial gross purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion.  The initial purchase price was subject to adjustment based on, among other things, the progress, timing and the construction cost of Revolution Wind, including changes in actual versus forecasted capital spending between signing the agreement and closing of the transaction.  On September 30, 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its 50 percent ownership share in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to GIP for adjusted gross proceeds of $745 million, which were received at closing.  Adjusted gross proceeds from the sale were approximately $375 million lower than the previously estimated purchase price.  This reduction reflects approximately $150 million resulting from lower capital spending between signing the agreement and closing, and approximately $225 million related to the final terms of the sale transaction, primarily due to the delay of the commercial operations date of Revolution Wind.  Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay parent company debt.\nAs part of the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind sale, Eversource and GIP agreed to make certain post-closing purchase price adjustment payments, which could further impact the final purchase price.  The post-closing purchase price adjustment payments include cost sharing obligations that require Eversource to share equally with GIP in GIP’s funding obligations up to an effective cap of approximately $240 million of incremental capital expenditure overruns incurred during the construction phase for Revolution Wind, after which Eversource will have responsibility for GIP’s obligations for any additional capital expenditure overruns in excess of this amount.  The purchase price is also subject to post-closing adjustments as a result of final project economics, which includes Eversource’s obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return through the construction period for each project as specified in the agreement.  Post-closing purchase price adjustment payments will be made following the commercial operation date of Revolution Wind.  South Fork Wind has achieved commercial operation, and Eversource is in the process of finalizing the construction cost post-close purchase price adjustment payment related to this project, which is not expected to be material. \nUpon the completion of both sale transactions in 2024, the total proceeds were compared to the carrying value of the investments, including an estimate of liability for post-closing adjustment payments to GIP, and Eversource recognized an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sales of its offshore wind investments of $524 million.  The aggregate, net after-tax loss is comprised of (1) the lower proceeds related to final terms of the sale transaction to GIP of approximately $225 million related to non-construction costs for the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, primarily due to a purchase price reduction of $150 million resulting from the delay of the commercial operations date of Revolution Wind, (2) recently identified forecasted construction costs as a result of a delay in the anticipated commercial operation date related to Revolution Wind of approximately $350 million, which includes an estimate for the anticipated post-closing adjustment to GIP related to Eversource’s expected cost overrun sharing obligation, and (3) approximately $326 million, which includes an estimate for the anticipated post-closing adjustment related to Eversource’s expected obligations to GIP as a result of final economics of the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects and other future costs, as well as a net $60 million increase in income tax expense including an increase in the valuation allowance for unused capital losses.  These losses were partially offset by the $377 million gain on the sale of Sunrise Wind. \nUpon sale, Eversource recorded a contingent liability of $365 million, reflecting its estimate of the future obligations under the GIP sale terms, which include the expected cost overrun sharing obligation, expected obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return, and obligation for other future costs.  The majority of this liability is expected to be settled upon the completion of the Revolution Wind project.  The long-term portion of the liability of $350 million is recorded in Other Long-Term Liabilities, and $15 million is recorded in Other Current Liabilities on Eversource’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. \n37\nContingencies are evaluated using the best information available at the time the financial statements are prepared, and this assessment involves judgments and assumptions about future events.  Factors that could increase the post-closing adjustment payments owed to GIP include the ultimate cost of construction and extent of cost overruns for Revolution Wind, delays in construction, which would impact the economics associated with the purchase price adjustment, and Revolution Wind’s eligibility for federal investment tax credits at a lower value than assumed and included in the purchase price.  \nThe purchase price included the sales value related to a 40 percent level of federal investment tax credits, 10 percent of which is the energy community investment tax credit (ITC) adder included in the Inflation Reduction Act of approximately $170 million related to Revolution Wind.  Although management believes the ITC adder value is realizable, there is some uncertainty at this time as to whether those ITC adders can be achieved, and management continues to evaluate the project’s qualifications and to monitor guidance issued by the United States Treasury Department.  A change in the expected value or qualification of ITC adders could result in a significant loss in a future period.\nNew information or future developments that arise as construction progresses and as cost estimates are reviewed and revised will require a reassessment of the estimated liability for the post-closing adjustment payments.  The Company is currently aware that construction of the offshore foundations, offshore substation and turbine tower installations could result in increased cost overruns in the future.  Only preliminary construction cost projections are available for these cost overruns, and there is insufficient updated information at this point in order for Eversource to change its estimate with reasonably estimable information.  Eversource will continue to assess the potential exposure and adjust the liability as needed.  It is expected that updated costs estimates will become available in the first half of 2025, and adverse changes in facts and circumstances could result in additional losses that could be material.  The Company believes it is reasonably possible that there is an additional loss in excess of the liability recorded, but management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss beyond the $365 million recorded at this time.  \nTotal net proceeds could also be adjusted for a benefit due to Eversource if there are lower operation costs or higher availability of the projects through the period that is four years following the commercial operation of Revolution Wind.   \nUnder the agreement with GIP, Eversource’s existing and certain additional credit support obligations for Revolution Wind are expected to roll off as the project completes construction.  Under the agreement with Ørsted, Eversource’s existing credit support obligations for Sunrise Wind were either terminated or indemnified by Ørsted as a result of the sale.  Eversource has entered into separate construction management agreements to manage Sunrise Wind’s and Revolution Wind’s onshore electric substation construction through completion. In this role, Eversource will be solely a service provider to Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind.\n2023 Impairments:\n  Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist as of the balance sheet date that indicate that the fair value of the investment may be less than book value.  Eversource continually monitors and evaluates its equity method investments to determine if there are indicators of an other-than-temporary impairment.  If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.  Impairment evaluations are based on best information available at the impairment assessment date.  Subsequent declines or recoveries after the reporting date are not considered in the impairment recognized.  Investments that are other-than-temporarily impaired and written down to their estimated fair value cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value.  Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist at the equity method investment level, selecting discount rates used to determine fair values, and developing an estimate of discounted future cash flows expected from investment operations or the sale of the investment.  \nDuring 2023, in connection with the process to divest its offshore wind business, Eversource identified indicators for impairment in both the second and fourth quarters of 2023.  In each impairment assessment, Eversource evaluated its investments and determined that the carrying value of the equity method offshore wind investments exceeded the fair value of the investments and that the decline in fair value was other-than-temporary.  The completion of the strategic review in the second quarter of 2023 resulted in Eversource recording a pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $401 million ($331 million after-tax) to reflect the investment at estimated fair value based on the expected sales price at that time. This established a new cost basis in the investments.  Negative developments in the fourth quarter of 2023, including a lower expected sales price, additional projected construction cost increases, and the October 2023 OREC pricing denial for Sunrise Wind, resulted in Eversource conducting an impairment evaluation and recognizing an additional pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $1.77 billion ($1.62 billion after-tax) and establishing a new cost basis in the investments as of December 31, 2023.  The Eversource statement of income for the year ended 2023 reflects a total pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $2.17 billion ($1.95 billion after-tax) in its offshore wind investments.  The impairment charges were non-cash charges and did not impact Eversource’s cash position at the time of the impairment.  Eversource’s offshore wind investments did not meet the criteria to qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. \nThe 2023 impairment evaluations involved judgments in developing the estimates and timing of the future cash flows arising from the expected sales price of Eversource’s 50 percent interest in the wind projects, including expected sales value from investment tax credit adder amounts, less estimated costs to sell, and uncertainties related to the Sunrise Wind re-bid process in New York’s offshore wind solicitation in 2024.  Additional assumptions in the fourth quarter 2023 assessment included revised projected construction costs and estimated project cost overruns, management’s assumption that the Sunrise Wind project would ultimately be abandoned, estimated termination costs, salvage values of Sunrise Wind assets, and the value of the tax equity ownership interest. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses were subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity.  All significant inputs into the impairment evaluations were Level 3 fair value measurements. \n38\nA summary of the significant estimates and assumptions included in the 2023 impairment charges is as follows:\nSecond Quarter 2023\nFourth Quarter 2023\nTotal\n(Millions of Dollars)\nLower expected sales proceeds across all three wind projects\n$\n401 \n$\n525 \n$\n926 \nExpected cost overruns not recovered in the sales price \n— \n441 \n441 \nLoss of sales value from the sale price offered by GIP, including loss of ITC adders value, cancellation costs and other impacts assuming Sunrise Wind project is abandoned\n— \n800 \n800 \nImpairment Charges, pre-tax\n401 \n1,766 \n2,167 \nTax Benefit\n(70)\n(144)\n(214)\nImpairment Charges, after-tax\n$\n331 \n$\n1,622 \n1,953 \nA summary of the carrying value by investee and by project as of December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nInvestments Expected to be Disposed of\nInvestment to be Held\nNorth East Offshore\nSouth Fork Class B Member, LLC\nSouth Fork Wind Holdings, LLC Class A\nTotal Offshore Wind Investments\n(Millions of Dollars)\nSunrise Wind\nRevolution Wind\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2023, before \n  Impairment Charge\n$\n699 \n$\n799 \n$\n299 \n$\n485 \n$\n2,282 \nFourth Quarter 2023 Impairment Charge\n(1,218)\n(544)\n— \n(4)\n(1,766)\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(519)\n$\n255 \n$\n299 \n$\n481 \n$\n516 \nDuring 2024, Eversource sold its interest in the North East Offshore and South Fork Class B, Member LLC equity method investments and recognized an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sale of its offshore wind investments of $524 million.  \nCapital contributions in the offshore wind investments, including the 2023 contribution for the tax equity investment in South Fork Wind, were included in Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates on the statements of cash flows.  Proceeds received from the sale of the investments in 2024, and proceeds received from the 2023 sale of the unused lease area and from an October 2023 distribution of $318 million received primarily as a result of being a 50 percent joint owner in the Class B shares of South Fork Wind which was restructured as a tax equity investment, were included in Proceeds from Unconsolidated Affiliates on the statements of cash flows.  \nFERC Regulatory Matters\nFERC ROE Complaints:\n  Four separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants).  In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15-month complaint periods.  In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable. \nThe ROE originally billed during the period October 1, 2011 (beginning of the first complaint period) through October 15, 2014 consisted of a base ROE of 11.14 percent and incentives up to 13.1 percent.  On October 16, 2014, FERC issued Opinion No. 531-A and set the base ROE at 10.57 percent and the incentive cap at 11.74 percent for the first complaint period.  This was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning October 16, 2014.  This FERC order was vacated on April 14, 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court).  \nAll amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded.  Eversource has recorded a reserve of $39.1 million (pre-tax and excluding interest) for the second complaint period as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.  This reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a 10.57 percent base ROE and 11.74 percent incentive cap.  The reserve consisted of $21.4 million for CL&P, $14.6 million for NSTAR Electric and $3.1 million for PSNH as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nOn October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court.  FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE.  Initial briefs were filed by the NETOs, Complainants and FERC Trial Staff on January 11, 2019 and reply briefs were filed on March 8, 2019.  The NETOs' brief was supportive of the overall ROE methodology determined in the October 16, 2018 order provided the FERC does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results. \nThe FERC order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using FERC's proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint.  Those illustrative calculations indicated that for the first complaint period, for the NETOs, which FERC concludes are of average financial risk, the preliminary just and reasonable base ROE is 10.41 percent and the preliminary incentive cap on total ROE is 13.08 percent.  If the results of the illustrative calculations were included in a final FERC order for each of the complaint periods, then a 10.41 percent base ROE and a 13.08 percent incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periods.  These preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final FERC order.\n39\nOn November 21, 2019, FERC issued Opinion No. 569 affecting the two pending transmission ROE complaints against the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) transmission owners, in which FERC adopted a new methodology for determining base ROEs.  Various parties sought rehearing.  On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed supplementary materials in the NETOs' four pending cases to respond to this new methodology because of the uncertainty of the applicability to the NETOs' cases.  On May 21, 2020, the FERC issued its order in Opinion No. 569-A on the rehearing of the MISO transmission owners' cases, in which FERC again changed its methodology for determining the MISO transmission owners' base ROEs.  On November 19, 2020, the FERC issued Opinion No. 569-B denying rehearing of Opinion No. 569-A and reaffirmed the methodology previously adopted in Opinion No. 569-A.  The new methodology differs significantly from the methodology proposed by FERC in its October 16, 2018 order to determine the NETOs' base ROEs in their four pending cases.  FERC Opinion Nos. 569-A and 569-B were appealed to the Court.  On August 9, 2022, the Court issued its decision vacating MISO ROE FERC Opinion Nos. 569, 569-A and 569-B and remanded to FERC to reopen the proceedings.  The Court found that FERC’s development of the new return methodology was arbitrary and capricious due to FERC’s failure to offer a reasonable explanation for its decision to reintroduce the risk-premium financial model in its new methodology for calculating a just and reasonable return. \nOn October 17, 2024, FERC issued an order on the remand of the MISO ROE proceedings. The order addressed the Court’s decision that the reintroduction of the risk-premium financial model in the ROE methodology was arbitrary and capricious by removing the risk-premium financial model from the ROE methodology.  The removal of the risk-premium financial model was the only revision to FERC’s ROE methodology and resulted in a two-model approach utilizing the two-step discounted cash flow model and the capital asset pricing model.  MISO was directed to provide refunds for the period November 12, 2013 to February 11, 2015 (the first MISO ROE complaint refund period) and for the period from September 28, 2016 (the date of FERC’s order on the first MISO ROE complaint) to October 17, 2024 by December 1, 2025.  The order also stated that FERC does not preclude the use of the risk-premium financial model in future proceedings if the parties can demonstrate that FERC’s stated concerns around the inclusion of the model have been addressed.\nOn November 13, 2024, the NETOs filed a supplemental brief in their four pending ROE proceedings to explain to FERC that it cannot apply the reasoning and methodologies of the MISO ROE case to the NETOs’ cases due to the entirely different set of facts in the MISO and NETOs ROE proceedings.  Doing so would violate the substance of the Court’s April 14, 2017 order and would violate the legal standard required by the Federal Power Act.\nOn February 4, 2025, the MISO transmission owners submitted a petition for review with the Court requesting review of the October 17, 2024 MISO ROE order on remand and a December 19, 2024 notice of denial of rehearing.  The petition requests review of FERC’s decision to retroactively backdate the MISO transmission owners’ base ROE to the date of an earlier order that FERC abandoned when it issued Order No. 569, treat an underlying unlawful complaint as if it were legitimate, and order eight years of interest as part of the directed refunds.\nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the applicability of the FERC order in the MISO transmission owners’ two complaint cases to the NETOs’ pending four complaint cases due to the complex differences between the cases, Eversource concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaints or subsequent periods at this time and Eversource cannot reasonably estimate any potential range of loss for any of the four complaint proceedings at this time.  The resolution of these proceedings could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH currently record revenues at the 10.57 percent base ROE and incentive cap at 11.74 percent established in the October 16, 2014 FERC order. \nA change of 10 basis points to the base ROE used to establish the reserves would impact Eversource’s after-tax earnings by an average of approximately $3 million for each of the four 15-month complaint periods.  Prospectively from the date of a final FERC order implementing a new base ROE, based off of estimated 2024 rate base, a change of 10 basis points to the base ROE would impact Eversource’s future annual after-tax earnings by approximately $6 million per year, and will increase slightly over time as we continue to invest in our transmission infrastructure.\nTransmission Rates and Other Transmission Rates-Related Proceedings:  \nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH transmission rates are calculated in accordance with a FERC-approved formula ratemaking framework and each utility is required to file an annual update on or before July 31st with resulting rates effective January 1st the following year.  The formula rate framework provides for an annual reconciliation of the prior calendar year actual costs incurred related to our transmission facilities, including an allowed ROE, plus forecasted information through the next rate period.  The annual update process includes formula rate protocols that provide disclosure of cost inputs, an opportunity for informal discovery procedures and a challenge process, which provides transparency to stakeholders. \nFrom time to time, various matters are pending before FERC relating to transmission rates, incentives, interconnections and transmission planning. Depending on the outcome, any of these matters could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.  At this time, Eversource cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the matters currently pending before FERC, and the resulting impact on its transmission incentives or planning.\n40\nRegulatory Developments and Rate Matters\nElectric, Natural Gas and Water Utility Retail Tariff Rates:  \nEach Eversource utility subsidiary is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the state in which it operates:  CL&P, Yankee Gas and Aquarion operate in Connecticut and are subject to PURA regulation; NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Aquarion operate in Massachusetts and are subject to DPU regulation; and PSNH and Aquarion operate in New Hampshire and are subject to NHPUC regulation.  The regulated companies' distribution rates are set by their respective state regulatory commissions, and their tariffs include mechanisms for periodically adjusting their rates for the recovery of specific incurred costs.  \nBase Distribution Rates:\n  \nIn Connecticut, PURA is required to conduct a review and investigation of the financial and operating records of each electric, natural gas and water utility serving more than seventy-five thousand customers within four years of its last general rate hearing.  PURA can elect to convene a general rate hearing at an interval of less than four years unless prohibited from doing so by an agency decision or other law.  In Massachusetts, electric distribution companies are required to file distribution rate schedules every five years, and natural gas local distribution companies to file distribution rate schedules every 10 years, and those companies are limited to one settlement agreement in any 10-year period.  Aquarion is not required to initiate a rate review with the DPU.  In New Hampshire, PSNH is not required to initiate a rate review with the NHPUC on any set timeframe, and the NHPUC has no obligation to hear any rate matter that it has investigated within a period of two years, though it may elect to do so at its discretion.\nRate Reconciling Mechanisms:\n \nThe Eversource electric distribution companies obtain and resell power to retail customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH enter into full requirements energy supply procurement contracts for its customers that choose to purchase power from the electric distribution company (standard offer, basic service or default energy service, respectively).  The natural gas distribution companies procure natural gas for firm and seasonal customers.  These energy supply and natural gas supply procurement costs are recovered from customers in supply rates that are approved by the respective state regulatory commission.  The rates are reset periodically (every six months for electric residential customers) and are fully reconciled to their costs.  New energy supply rates for residential customers are established effective July 1st at CL&P and NSTAR Electric and effective August 1st at PSNH.  Each electric and natural gas distribution company fully recovers its energy supply costs through approved regulatory rate mechanisms on a timely basis and, therefore, such costs have no impact on earnings.  Increases or decreases in energy supply retail rates result in corresponding fluctuations in both energy supply procurement revenues and purchased power or purchased natural gas expenses on the statements of income.\nThe electric and natural gas distribution companies also recover certain other costs from customers in retail rates on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, state mandated energy purchase agreements and other energy-related costs, electric retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), certain capital tracking mechanisms for infrastructure improvements, and additionally for the Massachusetts utilities, pension and PBOP benefits, net metering for distributed generation, and solar-related programs.  The reconciliation filings compare the total actual costs allowed to revenue requirements related to these services and the difference between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual costs allowed is deferred and included, to be either recovered or refunded, in future customer rates.  These cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned, return on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings. \nConnecticut:  \nCL&P Performance Based Rate Making:\n  On May 26, 2021, in accordance with an October 2020 Connecticut law, PURA opened a proceeding to begin to evaluate and eventually implement performance-based regulation (PBR) for electric distribution companies.  PURA is conducting the proceeding in two phases.  On January 25, 2023, PURA staff issued a proposal outlining a suggested portfolio of PBR elements for further exploration and potential implementation in the second phase of the proceeding.  On April 26, 2023, PURA issued a final decision on the first phase and identified various objectives to guide PBR development and evaluate adoption of a PBR framework.  The decision commenced Phase 2 by initiating three reopener dockets focused on revenue adjustment mechanisms, performance metrics and integrated distribution system planning with final decisions expected in 2025.\nOn November 16, 2023, PURA issued a straw proposal in the first reopener that focused on revenue adjustment mechanisms.  The proposal outlines potential additions and reforms to the current revenue adjustment mechanisms, such as multi-year rate plans, earnings sharing mechanisms and the revenue decoupling mechanism.  On March 14, 2024, PURA issued a straw proposal in the second reopener docket which concentrates on performance mechanisms in a PBR framework. The proposal suggests the development of performance incentive mechanisms, reported metrics and scorecards.  These straw proposals are not authoritative and additional technical sessions, hearings and testimony will continue prior to a final decision, which will not be applied until the time of CL&P’s next distribution rate case.  PURA is expected to issue updated straw proposals in the first and second reopener dockets in the first quarter of 2025.\nWe continue to monitor developments in this proceeding, and at this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding and the resulting impact to CL&P. \n41\nCL&P Storm Filings:\n  On March 28, 2024, PURA established a prudency review proceeding for the purpose of receiving and reviewing evidence of the costs reported by CL&P in response to catastrophic storms and pre-staging events totaling approximately $634 million that occurred between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021.  PURA established a partial procedural schedule with hearings scheduled in the third quarter of 2025.  On December 31, 2024, CL&P filed a supplement to its March 2024 prudency review application to request that PURA evaluate the prudence of its costs for nine additional catastrophic storms and two additional pre-staging events for the period January 1, 2022 through January 31, 2023 totaling approximately $173 million.  Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, we continue to believe these deferred storm restoration costs were prudently incurred and are probable of recovery. \nCL&P RAM Filing:\n  On April 17, 2024, PURA issued an interim decision in CL&P’s Rate Adjustment Mechanisms (RAM) filing and approved rates for six RAM components, with rates effective July 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  The rate approvals include the recovery of NBFMCC and SBC net underrecoveries as of December 31, 2023 of $264.9 million and $86.2 million, respectively, and the recovery of expected net costs of $388.5 million for the NBFMCC and $254.4 million for the SBC for the period July 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  The NBFMCC rate adjustment is primarily driven by long-term nuclear power purchase agreements required by state policy (Millstone and Seabrook) and the SBC rate adjustment is primarily driven by costs associated with accounts receivable hardship customer protection and the new low-income discount rate effective December 2023. On August 14, 2024, PURA issued a final decision that approved a further adjustment to the NBFMCC rate to include the recovery of incurred and deferred electric vehicle program costs from 2021 through May 31, 2024 of $44.4 million and expected electric vehicle program costs from June 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 of $24.3 million.  The $44.4 million, plus $5.4 million in carrying costs, will be recovered over a 20-month period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2026, and the $24.3 million will be recovered over an eight-month period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  In addition, PURA approved an incremental $3.5 million of 2024 Innovative Energy Solutions program costs and $1.5 million of Connecticut Green Bank program costs over an eight-month period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  These amounts are included in the “Public Benefits” portion of the customer bills in Connecticut.\nCL&P Advanced Metering Infrastructure Filing:\n  On January 3, 2024, PURA issued a final decision regarding CL&P’s Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) investment and implementation plan, which CL&P estimated at $766.4 million for capital costs and operating expenses.  In CL&P’s view, the final decision does not provide a reasonable path for cost recovery and delays implementation by at least a year during the pendency of the cost recovery proceeding.  In addition, in CL&P’s view, the final decision modifies the prudence standard for recovery of costs expended on the project, improperly linking recovery to outcomes not known at the outset of the project.  On January 18, 2024, CL&P submitted a motion for reconsideration to PURA, asking that the agency modify these aspects of the decision, which PURA subsequently denied on February 14, 2024.  On March 6, 2024, CL&P filed written comments citing four major problems associated with PURA’s guidelines for recovery of the costs of AMI implementation, which if not addressed, represent obstacles to AMI implementation in Connecticut.  On April 16, 2024, PURA issued a procedural order directing Eversource and inviting all parties and intervenors to submit pre-filed testimony pertaining to AMI by May 14, 2024, and rebuttal testimony by May 29, 2024.  CL&P witnesses filed testimony, including an updated estimate of $855 million for capital costs and operating expenses, and then subsequently participated in the AMI cost recovery hearing on June 6,\n \n2024.  \nOn October 17, 2024, PURA issued a proposed final decision on recovery of the costs for AMI implementation.  Written exceptions to the proposed final decision were filed on October 31, 2024, and oral arguments were presented on November 7, 2024.  CL&P’s written exceptions focused on three main aspects of the proposed decision, which include (1) clarifying the prudence standard to be used in evaluating AMI investments, (2) timing of prudency reviews, and (3) cost recovery related to incremental O&M expenses.  On December 4, 2024, PURA issued a final decision on the recovery of costs for AMI implementation.  On December 9, 2024, CL&P filed a petition for reconsideration because PURA had not fully resolved the issues CL&P raised in its October 31, 2024 written exceptions.  On January 3, 2025, PURA stated it will evaluate the merits of CL&P’s petition for reconsideration.  Under state law, PURA is expected to issue its decision within 90 days of January 3, 2025.\nYankee Gas Distribution Rate Case:\n  On November 12, 2024, Yankee Gas filed an application with PURA to amend its existing distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2025.  Yankee Gas’s rate application requested approval of a distribution rate increase of $209 million, which included a base distribution rate increase of $274 million, partially offset by a reduction of $65 million in the combined Gas System Improvements and System Expansion Reconciliation rates.  In addition, Yankee Gas requested approval to implement a rate credit of $37.4 million to offset the PGA rate for non-firm margin credits over one year beginning November 1, 2025.  As part of the rate case, Yankee Gas proposed to implement a multi-year performance-based rate making plan with a four-year initial term from November 1, 2025 to October 31, 2029 that would adjust rates annually and includes performance metrics.  A final decision by PURA is expected in October 2025.\nAquarion Water Company of Connecticut Distribution Rate Case:\n  On August 29, 2022, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut (AWC-CT) filed an application with PURA to amend its existing rate schedules to address an operating revenue deficiency.  AWC-CT’s rate application requested approval of rate increases of $27.5 million, an additional $13.6 million, and an additional $8.8 million, effective March 15, 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively.  On March 15, 2023, PURA issued a final decision that rejected this request.  In this decision, PURA ordered a decrease to total authorized revenues of $4.0 million effective March 15, 2023.  The decision allows an authorized regulatory ROE of 8.70 percent.  On March 30, 2023, AWC-CT filed an appeal on the decision and requested a stay of the decision with the State of Connecticut Superior Court.  On April 5, 2023, the Court temporarily granted AWC-CT’s request to stay and on May 25, 2023 granted a permanent stay of certain orders affecting base rates, which would keep existing rates in place until the appeal is completed.  The stay included the condition that AWC-CT place any revenue received from customers above the rates and amounts authorized in the March 15, 2023 decision in a separate, interest bearing account until further order.  On March 25, 2024, the State of Connecticut Superior Court issued a decision on the appeal which dismissed nine, remanded back to PURA two, and partially remanded one of AWC-CT’s twelve claims of error in its appeal.  On March 28, 2024, AWC-CT filed an appeal of the Connecticut Superior Court decision to the Connecticut Appellate Court, and that appeal was subsequently transferred to the Connecticut Supreme Court for review.  A ruling on the appeal is pending. \n42\nOn April 18, 2024, PURA initiated a docket to address the matters on remand.  On July 31, 2024, PURA issued a final decision in this docket and increased AWC-CT’s approved revenue requirement by $0.1 million above the amount authorized in the March 15, 2023 decision.  Rates went into effect on July 31, 2024.  On September 13, 2024, AWC-CT filed an appeal of PURA’s July 31, 2024 final decision to the Connecticut Superior Court.  A ruling on the appeal is pending.\nAs a result of the State of Connecticut Superior Court’s March 2024 decision on the appeal, AWC-CT recorded the impacts of the PURA rate case decision from the effective date of the order on March 15, 2023 through December 31, 2024.  The impacts primarily include a reduction to depreciation expense to reflect lower depreciation rates ordered by PURA in its final decision, partially offset by lower authorized revenues.  These adjustments resulted in an after-tax benefit of $11.6 million in 2024.  \nMassachusetts:\nNSTAR Electric Distribution Rates\n:  NSTAR Electric’s PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation, exogenous events and future capital additions based on a historical five-year average of total capital additions.  On September 16, 2024, NSTAR Electric submitted its annual PBR Adjustment filing for a $55.8 million increase to base distribution rates, for effect on January 1, 2025.  The requested base distribution rate increase is comprised of a $35.3 million inflation-based adjustment and a $20.5 million adjustment for capital additions based on the difference between the historical five-year average of total capital additions and the base capital revenue requirement. On December 23, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nNSTAR Electric CIP Filing:\n  On December 30, 2022, the DPU approved a provisional system planning tariff for the recovery of costs associated with a capital investment project (CIP) proposal submitted by NSTAR Electric for one of six geographic study areas in its service territory in accordance with DPU’s directives.  The DPU established a new, provisional framework for planning and funding upgrades to the electric power system to foster development and interconnection of distributed energy facilities.  Under the DPU program, NSTAR Electric has filed infrastructure upgrade proposals to be built within a four-year construction timeframe that allocate the costs of interconnection upgrades between the interconnecting distributed generation facility and distribution customers based on a technical analysis of capacity benefits.  Payments made by the distributed generation facility will be applied against the total capital investment made by NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Electric will earn a return on the net investment.  The amount allocated to distribution customers will be recovered through a reconciling mechanism, the Provisional System Planning Tariff.  The DPU approved the first of these provisional system planning projects, the Marion-Fairhaven group study area, which will enable 141 MW of distributed energy resources (DER) to be interconnected at a total estimated cost of $120 million.  Of the total $120 million, $66 million will be allocated to distribution customers, once the enabled distributed energy facilities capacity is fully subscribed by distributed energy facilities interconnecting customers.  Additionally, NSTAR Electric will proceed with construction of approximately $54 million of transmission upgrades necessary to improve local reliability and integrate distribution energy resources in the Marion-Fairhaven area and recover the amount through local transmission rates.\nOn June 4, 2024, the DPU approved four of the remaining five CIPs that were originally submitted by NSTAR Electric.  These included the Plainfield-Blandford CIP, which will enable 40 MW of DER to be interconnected at a total estimated distribution investment of $37 million, the Dartmouth-Westport CIP which enables 60 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $58 million, the Plymouth CIP which enables 380 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $152 million and the Cape Cod CIP which enables 296 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $170 million.  Of the total $417 million for these four recently approved CIPs, $183 million will be allocated to distribution customers, once the enabled distributed energy facilities capacity is fully subscribed by distributed energy facilities interconnecting customers.  Additionally, NSTAR Electric will proceed with construction of approximately $64 million of transmission upgrades necessary to improve local reliability and integrate distribution energy resources in the four CIP areas and recover the amount through local transmission rates.  On January 27, 2025, NSTAR Electric filed a petition with the DPU to withdraw the sixth CIP project, Freetown, that was originally submitted.\nNSTAR Electric’s Electric Sector Modernization Plan (ESMP) Filing\n:  On January 29, 2024, in accordance with Massachusetts state law, NSTAR Electric filed its ESMP with the DPU.  The law required each electric distribution company to develop and file a comprehensive distribution system plan to proactively upgrade the distribution system (and, where applicable, the associated transmission system) to: (i) improve grid reliability, communications and resiliency; (ii) enable increased, timely adoption of renewable energy and distributed energy resources; (iii) promote energy storage and electrification technologies necessary to decarbonize the environment and economy; (iv) prepare for future climate-driven impacts on the transmission and distribution systems; (v) accommodate increased transportation electrification, increased building electrification and other potential future demands on distribution and, where applicable, the transmission system; and (vi) minimize or mitigate impacts on Massachusetts ratepayers, thereby helping the state realize its statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits and sublimits under the law.  NSTAR Electric’s plan meets these requirements by providing a comprehensive view of all the investments required to build a safer, more reliable, more resilient electric distribution system to enable an affordable, equitable clean energy transition taking into account the needs of environmental justice communities.  For the five-year period from 2025 through 2029, the proposed incremental distribution capital investment is $608 million and the incremental distribution expense amount is $211 million.  On August 29, 2024, the DPU approved the overall ESMP for a five-year period commencing July 1, 2025.  \nOn November 21, 2024, the DPU opened a second phase of the proceeding to consider a short-term ESMP-focused cost recovery mechanism and metrics.  In issuing the notice of proceeding, the DPU limited the review of investment in this docket and excluded NSTAR Electric’s ESMP proposals regarding the EV Phase II extension, low and moderate income solar and the new CIPs.  These investments will be reviewed in separate proceedings.  This reduced the amount of company-proposed incremental capital investment to $295 million and the incremental expense to $44 million related to resiliency and grid modernization.  NSTAR Electric filed its proposed tariff and testimony on December 18, 2024, and is currently in the discovery process, which will be followed by hearings and briefing with completion of the proceeding and final orders expected prior to the start of the plan in July 2025.\n43\nNSTAR Gas Distribution Rates:\n  NSTAR Gas’ PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation and exogenous events.  On September 16, 2024, NSTAR Gas submitted its annual PBR Adjustment filing for a $12.7 million increase to base distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2024.  On October 30, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nEGMA Distribution Rates:\n  On November 4, 2024, EGMA submitted a revised filing for its first rate base reset for rates to be effective November 1, 2024, in accordance with an October 7, 2020 EGMA Rate Settlement Agreement approved by the DPU.  The compliance filing was ordered by the DPU on October 31, 2024.  The rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2024 adjusted distribution rates to account for capital additions (including the roll-in of GSEP capital additions), depreciation expense, property taxes, and return on rate base for capital additions placed into service through December 31, 2023.  The total revenue requirement calculated for the first rate base reset is an increase to base distribution rates of $147.8 million, of which $34.0 million is associated with GSEP investments through December 31, 2023.  Under the terms of the Rate Settlement Agreement, EGMA applied a cap on the revenue change effective November 1, 2024, and the amount in excess of the cap will be deferred for recovery through the Local Distribution Adjustment Clause (LDAC) on May 1, 2025, including carrying charges.  After adjusting for the cap, the increase to base distribution rates is $85.6 million effective November 1, 2024 (of which $8.8 million is offset by a reduction in the GSEP revenue requirement and GSEP rate also taking effect on November 1, 2024 for a net distribution rate change on November 1, 2024 of $76.8 million).  Base distribution rates will be increased effective November 1, 2025 to incorporate the $62.2 million remaining revenue requirement.  On November 7, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nFuture of Gas Docket:\n  In October 2020, the DPU opened Docket “DPU 20-80 The Future of Gas” to examine the role of Massachusetts natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs) in helping to meet the state’s 2050 climate goals.  In December 2023, the DPU issued an order for this docket. The DPU will consider and, in some cases, require new processes and analysis for traditional natural gas investments, which may require significant changes to the LDC planning process and business models.  The DPU intends to put policies and structures in place that would protect customers as Massachusetts works to decarbonize the building sector, which may involve subsequent dockets and regulatory proceedings and potentially recasting the role of LDCs in Massachusetts.  The DPU preserved customer choice for energy needs and encouraged further development of decarbonized alternatives, such as the networked geothermal systems that NSTAR Gas is piloting in Framingham, Massachusetts.  \nOn December 29, 2023, Eversource and other LDCs sought formal clarity from the DPU to fully understand the resulting impact to their natural gas businesses and the associated timing of any impacts.  On April 2, 2024, the DPU issued an order responding to the request for clarification indicating that the LDCs shall implement the inclusion of a Non-Gas Pipeline Alternatives (NPA) analysis on all project authorizations effective immediately.  Existing NPA analysis processes will be used until such time a formal stakeholder-based NPA analysis framework is established and approved by the DPU.  Eversource, along with the other LDCs, have engaged a consultant to inform the development of the required NPA framework by conducting a stakeholder engagement process as mandated by the order.  Another component of the order is the submission of climate compliance plans every five years beginning April 1, 2025. The climate compliance plan filings will include the NPA frameworks, along with energy transitions plans including details on the management of embedded infrastructure investments and cost recovery. Eversource along with the LDCs, have also contracted a consultant to model and investigate statewide cost recovery scenarios including under accelerated depreciation rates. \nThe DPU also indicated that NSTAR Gas and EGMA are not required to provide climate compliance performance metrics in the next PBR filing, however would be expected to propose metrics at the latest in the next base distribution rate proceeding.  GHG emissions reporting was not changed from the order, however, effective November of 2024, reporting requirements have changed per the MA DEP and these requirements implement registration and GHG emissions reporting requirements for companies selling and distributing heating fuels to homes and businesses in Massachusetts, including suppliers of natural gas, fuel oil, and propane, and implement a reporting requirement for fuel storage facilities.  \nEversource does not believe there is any indication of an inability to recover costs or risk of impairment of NSTAR Gas’ and EGMA’s natural gas assets at this time. \nNew Hampshire:\nPSNH Distribution Rate Case\n:  On June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for approval of a temporary annual base distribution rate increase.  On July 31, 2024, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement that was reached by PSNH, New Hampshire Department of Energy, and the Office of the Consumer Advocate to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $61.2 million effective August 1, 2024.\nAlso on June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC to request an increase in permanent base distribution rates of $181.9 million, which is inclusive of the temporary rate increase, and proposed to take effect August 1, 2025.  The temporary rates are subject to reconciliation based on the outcome of the permanent rate case back to the date when temporary rates took effect.  The permanent rate increase request includes $247 million in unrecovered storm costs to be recovered over a five-year period.  As part of the rate case, PSNH proposed to implement a performance-based rate making plan that would adjust rates annually over a four-year term, with a commitment to not file another rate case for at least four years.  The plan includes a revenue-cap formula adjusted for inflation, a supplemental capital adjustment formula to support PSNH’s planned capital infrastructure improvements, an exogenous events recovery mechanism, performance metrics and an earnings sharing mechanism, among others.  If the NHPUC approves the performance-based rate making plan as proposed, the previously established RRA and PPAM rate reconciling mechanisms and lost base revenues will be eliminated.  The NHPUC is permitted up to twelve months to investigate the proposed rates and issue a final order.  A decision by the NHPUC on permanent rates is expected by August 1, 2025.\n44\nLegislative and Policy Matters\nFederal:\n  On April 10, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the final regulation setting drinking water standards for six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) compounds.  The regulation requires compliance under a phased approach in which systems will need to complete the initial monitoring requirements for each PFAS within three years, and when warranted, take steps to assure compliance within five years.  Beginning in 2027, systems will need to report results of initial monitoring and regular monitoring and issue public notifications for any monitoring and reporting violations.  Starting in 2029, systems must comply with all maximum contaminant levels (MCL) and provide public notification for MCL violations.  Eversource is currently evaluating the impacts to comply with the regulation for its water business. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments.  Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our management discusses with the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies.  Our critical accounting policies are discussed below.  See the combined notes to our financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.    \nRegulatory Accounting\n:  Our regulated companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses.  The regulated companies' financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process.  The rates charged to the customers of our regulated companies are designed to collect each company's costs to provide service, plus a return on investment.  \nWe believe that the operations of each of our regulated companies currently satisfy the criteria for application of regulatory accounting.  If events or circumstances should change in a future period so that those criteria are no longer satisfied, we would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the statement of income and may result in a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition.\nThe application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates.  In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission.  We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery.  We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent.  \nRegulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.  We make judgments regarding the future outcome of regulatory proceedings that involve potential future refund to customers and record liabilities for these loss contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable based upon available information.  Regulatory liabilities are recorded at the best estimate, or at a low end of the range of possible loss.  The amount recorded may differ from when the uncertainty is resolved.  Such differences could have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nWe continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or refund.  This assessment includes consideration of recent orders issued by regulatory commissions, the passage of new legislation, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in each of our jurisdictions, discussions with legal counsel, the status of any appeals of regulatory decisions, and changes in applicable regulatory and political environments.  We believe that we will continue to be able to defer and recover prudently incurred costs, including additional storm costs, based on the legal and regulatory framework.\nWe use judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our financial statements.  The ultimate outcome of regulatory rate proceedings could have a significant effect on our ability to recover costs or earn an adequate return.  Established rates are also often subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed.  \nStorm restoration and pre-staging costs are subject to prudency reviews from our regulators.  We have $2.10 billion of deferred storm costs that either have yet to be filed with the applicable regulatory commission, are pending regulatory approval, or are subject to prudency review as of December 31, 2024.  Tropical Storm Isaias in August 2020 resulted in deferred storm restoration costs of approximately $232 million at CL&P as of December 31, 2024.  While it is possible that some amount of the Tropical Storm Isaias costs may be disallowed by PURA, any such amount cannot be estimated at this time. We believe that our storm restoration costs were prudently incurred, meet the criteria for cost recovery and are probable of recovery.\nWe believe it is probable that each of our regulated companies will recover its respective investments in long-lived assets and the regulatory assets that have been recorded.  If we determine that we can no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises, or that we cannot conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered from customers in future rates, the applicable costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.\n45\nPension, SERP and PBOP:\n  We sponsor Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans to provide retirement benefits to our employees.  Plan assets and the benefit obligation are presented on a net basis and we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet.  These amounts are remeasured annually using a December 31st measurement date.  For each of these plans, several significant assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation, funded status, and net periodic benefit expense/income.  These assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate, cash balance interest crediting rate and mortality and retirement assumptions.  We evaluate these assumptions annually and adjust them as necessary.  Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets Assumption\n:  In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we consider historical and expected returns, as well as input from our consultants.  Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class.  We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, our expected long-term rate-of-return assumption used to determine our pension and PBOP expense was 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service Pension and PBOP plans.  \nFor the forecasted 2025 pension and PBOP expense, an expected long-term rate of return of 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service Pension and PBOP plans will be used reflecting our target asset allocations.\nDiscount Rate Assumptions\n:  Payment obligations related to the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plan's cash flows.  The discount rate that was utilized in determining the pension, SERP and PBOP obligations was based on a yield-curve approach.  This approach utilizes a population of bonds with an average rating of AA based on bond ratings by Moody's, S&P and Fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population.  As of December 31, 2024, the discount rates used to determine the funded status were within a range of 5.6 percent to 5.7 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and 5.7 percent for the PBOP Plans.  As of December 31, 2023, the discount rates used were within a range of 4.9 percent to 5.0 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent for the PBOP Plans.  The increase in the discount rates used to calculate the funded status resulted in a decrease to the Pension and SERP Plans’ projected benefit obligation of $332.9 million and a decrease to the PBOP Plans' projected benefit obligation of $39.8 million as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company uses the spot rate methodology for the service and interest cost components of Pension, SERP and PBOP expense because it provides a relatively precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.  The discount rates used to estimate the 2024 expense were within a range of 4.7 percent to 5.1 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of 4.9 percent to 5.2 percent for the PBOP Plans.  \nMortality Assumptions:\n  Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and the corresponding plan liability we need to record.  The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy.  In 2024, our mortality assumption utilized the Society of Actuaries base mortality tables (Pri-2012), adjusted to reflect Eversource’s own mortality experience, and projected generationally using the MP-2021 improvement scale.\nCompensation/Progression Rate Assumptions\n:  This assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements, and impacts the estimated benefits that Pension and SERP Plan participants will receive in the future.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the compensation/progression rates used to determine the Pension and SERP Plan funded status were within a range of 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent.     \nHealth Care Cost Assumptions\n:  The Eversource Service PBOP Plan is not subject to health care cost trends.  As of December 31, 2024, for the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care trend rate used to determine the funded status for pre-65 retirees is 7.5 percent, with an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2035, and for post-65 retirees, the health care trend rate and ultimate rate is 3.5 percent. \nCash Balance Interest Crediting Rate Assumption\n:  The Cash Balance Pension Plan is a new, additional obligation of the existing Pension Plan and the liability will begin to accrue benefits upon the effective date of January 1, 2025.  The cash balance interest crediting rate assumption represents the long-term rate by which the Pension Plan’s cash balance accounts are expected to grow.  Actual interest on the cash balance accounts is based on the 30-year U.S. Treasury securities rate in effect for September of the preceding year, with a minimum rate of 4 percent.  The cash balance interest crediting rate assumption used in determining the \nforecasted 2025 pension expense\n was 4.8 percent. \nActuarial Gains and Losses:\n  Actuarial gains and losses represent the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions.  Unamortized actuarial gains or losses arising at the December 31st measurement date are primarily from differences in actual investment performance compared to our expected return and changes in the discount rate assumption. The Eversource Service Pension and PBOP Plans use the corridor approach to determine the amount of gain or loss to amortize into net periodic benefit expense/income. The corridor approach defers all actuarial gains and losses arising at remeasurement and the net unrecognized actuarial gain or loss balance is amortized as a component of expense if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the market value of the plan’s assets or the projected benefit obligation. The amount of net unrecognized actuarial gain or loss in excess of the 10 percent corridor is amortized to expense over the estimated average future employee service period.  For the Eversource Service Pension Plan, the net actuarial gain or loss is amortized as a component of expense over the estimated average future employee service period of eleven years.  For the Eversource Service PBOP Plan, the net unrecognized actuarial gain or loss was within the 10 percent corridor and therefore there was no amortization to expense during 2024. \n46\nA decrease in the discount rate used to determine our pension funded status would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31st, resulting in a higher unamortized actuarial loss to be recognized in future years’ pension expense, subject to exceeding the 10 percent corridor.  A decrease in the discount rate at December 31st would also result in a decrease in the interest cost component and an increase in the service cost component of the subsequent year’s benefit plan expense. \nThe calculated expected return on plan assets is compared to the actual return or loss on plan assets at the end of each year to determine the investment gains or losses to be immediately reflected in unamortized actuarial gains and losses.  An underperformance of our pension plan investment returns relative to the expected returns would increase our pension liability at December 31st, resulting in a higher unamortized actuarial loss to be recognized in future years’ pension expense, subject to exceeding the 10 percent corridor, and a lower expected return on assets component of pension expense in future years’ pension expense.\nNet Periodic Benefit Expense/Income:\n  Pension, SERP and PBOP expense/income is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost/credit, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and the expected return on plan assets.  For the Pension and SERP Plans, pre-tax net periodic benefit income was $76.8 million, $108.4 million and $181.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For the PBOP Plans, pre-tax net periodic benefit income was $64.3 million, $57.3 million and $79.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nThe change in pension, SERP and PBOP expense/income arising from the annual remeasurement does not fully impact earnings.  Our Massachusetts utilities recover qualified pension and PBOP expenses related to their distribution operations through a rate reconciling mechanism that fully tracks the change in net pension and PBOP expenses each year, therefore the change in their pension and PBOP expense does not impact earnings.  Our electric transmission companies' rates provide for an annual true-up of estimated to actual costs, which include pension expenses, therefore the change in their pension expense does not impact earnings.  Any differences between the fixed level of PBOP expense included in our formula rate and the PBOP expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability, and is expected, over time, to be recovered from or returned to customers. Additionally, the portion of our pension and PBOP expense that relates to company labor devoted to capital projects is capitalized on the balance sheet instead of being charged to expense. \nForecasted Expense/Income and Expected Contributions\n:  We estimate that net periodic benefit income in 2025 for the Pension and SERP Plans will be approximately $93 million and for the PBOP Plans will be approximately $69 million.  The increase in pension income from 2024 to 2025 is driven primarily by lower amortization of actuarial losses, partially offset by an increase in the service cost component, both of which were due in part to the impact of the new cash balance pension plan.  The increase in PBOP income from 2024 to 2025 is driven primarily by favorable expected return on assets due to a higher asset balance.  For the PBOP Plans, there is no amortization of actuarial loss in 2025.  Pension, SERP and PBOP expense/income for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans. \nOur policy is to fund the Pension Plans annually in an amount at least equal to the amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements.  Based on the current status of the Pension Plans and federal pension funding requirements, for our Eversource Service Pension Plan there is no minimum funding requirement in 2025 and we do not expect to make pension contributions in 2025.  It is our policy to fund the PBOP Plans annually through tax deductible contributions to external trusts.  We do not expect to make any contributions to the Eversource Service PBOP Plan in 2025.  \nSensitivity Analysis\n:  The following table illustrates the hypothetical effect on reported annual net periodic benefit income as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points:  \nPension Plans (excluding SERP Plans) \nPBOP Plans\nDecrease in Plan Income\nDecrease/(Increase) in Plan Income\n(Millions of Dollars)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nEversource\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nLower expected long-term rate of return\n$\n28.9 \n$\n29.1 \n$\n5.0 \n$\n0.2 \nLower discount rate\n27.4 \n24.7 \n(0.5)\n4.7 \nHigher compensation rate\n5.9 \n8.1 \nN/A\nN/A\nGoodwill:\n  Goodwill is recognized on our balance sheet from previous mergers and acquisitions to the extent that the consideration paid exceeded the net fair value of the identified assets and liabilities acquired in each business combination.  We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by considering the fair values of the reporting units, which requires us to use estimates and judgments.  Additionally, we monitor all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required.  We have selected October 1st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment test date.  Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.  If goodwill were to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment.  \nWe have identified our reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill as Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution.  The Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission reporting units include carrying values for the respective components of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  The Natural Gas Distribution reporting unit includes the carrying values of NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and EGMA.  The Water Distribution reporting unit includes the Aquarion water utility businesses.  As of December 31, 2024, goodwill was allocated to the reporting units as follows: $2.54 billion to Electric Distribution, $577 million to Electric Transmission, and $451 million to Natural Gas Distribution.  Goodwill allocated to Water Distribution of $663 million is classified as held for sale.\n47\nIn assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists as of the annual impairment test date.  If we perform the qualitative assessment but determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expenses, but the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \nWe performed the annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2024 for the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reporting units.  Our qualitative assessment included an evaluation of multiple factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including general, macroeconomic and market conditions, and entity-specific assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units.  Key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, the Company's share price and credit ratings, analyst reports, financial performance, cost and risk factors, internal estimates and projections of future cash flows and net income, long-term strategy, the timing and outcome of rate cases, and recent regulatory and legislative proceedings.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we concluded that the likely sale of Aquarion at a loss resulted in the requirement to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for Water Distribution goodwill.  We compared the estimated fair value of the business from the anticipated transaction to its carrying value.  Assumptions used in the valuation were the future cash flows from the sale, including the estimated income tax impacts as a result of the transaction.  Based on the interim impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $297 million to write down the carrying value of the water distribution reporting unit to its estimated fair value.   \nWe did not identify any events or conditions that make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred at our other reporting units.  For these remaining reporting units, we believe that the fair value was substantially in excess of carrying value.  Adverse regulatory actions, changes in the regulatory and political environment, or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future goodwill impairment indicators.\nLong-Lived Assets:\n  Impairment evaluations of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other assets, involve a significant degree of estimation and judgment, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist.  An impairment analysis is required when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.  Indicators of potential impairment include a deteriorating business climate, unfavorable regulatory action, decline in value that is other than temporary in nature, plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, and accumulation of costs that are in excess of amounts allowed for recovery.  The review of long-lived assets for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and external developments, including assessment of current and projected market conditions that can impact future cash flows.  If indicators are present for a long-lived asset or asset group, a comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value is performed.  No significant impairments occurred during the year 2024. \nEquity Method Investments:\n Investments in affiliates where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are initially recognized as an equity method investment at cost.  Any differences between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of an investee are considered basis differences and are determined based upon the estimated fair values of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities.  \nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist as of the balance sheet date that indicate that the fair value of the investment may be less than book value.  Eversource continually monitors and evaluates its equity method investments to determine if there are indicators of an other-than-temporary impairment.  If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.  Impairment evaluations are based on best information available at the impairment assessment date.  Subsequent declines or recoveries after the reporting date are not considered in the impairment recognized. Investments that are other-than-temporarily impaired and written down to their estimated fair value cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value.  Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist at the equity method investment level, selecting discount rates used to determine fair values, and developing an estimate of discounted future cash flows expected from investment operations or the sale of the investment.\nDuring 2023, in connection with the process to divest its offshore wind business, Eversource identified indicators for impairment in both the second and fourth quarters of 2023.  In each impairment assessment, Eversource evaluated its investments and determined that the carrying value of the equity method offshore wind investments exceeded the fair value of the investments and that the decline was other-than-temporary.  The impairment evaluations involved judgments in developing the estimates and timing of future cash flows, including key judgments in determining the most likely outcome of the projects, the likelihood of realization of investment tax credit adders, and the likelihood of future spending amounts and cost overruns, as well as potential cancellation costs and salvage values of Sunrise Wind assets.  The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses were subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity. The use of different assumptions, estimates, or judgments with respect to the\nestimation of future cash flows could have materially changed the impairment charges. The impairment charges were non-cash charges and did not impact Eversource’s cash position at the time of the impairment.  During 2024, Eversource sold its interest in the North East Offshore and South Fork Class B, Member LLC equity method investments and recognized an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sale of its offshore wind investments of $524 million.\nLoss Contingencies:\n We make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information.  The assessment of loss contingencies involves judgments and assumptions about future events.  Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information. The amount recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved.  Such difference would be a change in estimate and could have a significant impact on the financial statements.  \n48\nUpon the sales of our offshore wind investments in the third quarter of 2024, Eversource recorded a contingent liability of $365 million, reflecting its estimate of the future obligations under the GIP sale terms.  Assumptions and key judgments in determining the estimated liability include the expected cost overrun sharing obligation, expected obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return, and obligation for other future costs, as well as the likelihood of realization of investment tax credit adders that were included in the purchase price.  The use of different assumptions, estimates, or judgments could materially impact the financial statements.  New information or future developments that arise as construction progresses and as cost estimates are reviewed and revised will require a reassessment of the estimated liability for the post-closing adjustment payments. Adverse changes in facts and circumstances could result in additional losses that could be material to the financial statements. \nAccounting for Environmental Reserves:\n  Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated.  Increases to estimates of environmental liabilities could have an adverse impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options (ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites.  If a most likely action plan cannot yet be determined, we estimate the liability based on the low end of a range of possible action plans.  A significant portion of our environmental sites and reserve amounts relate to former MGP sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured natural gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by-products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which we may have potential liability.  Estimates are based on the expected remediation plan.  Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site, the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates.  \nIncome Taxes:\n Income tax expense is estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and is recorded each quarter using an estimated annualized effective tax rate.  This process to record income tax expense involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes.  Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences, or other items that directly impact income tax expense as a result of regulatory activity (flow-through items).  The temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the balance sheets.\nWe also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets.  The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under applicable accounting guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us.   \nThe interpretation of tax laws and associated regulations involves uncertainty since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently.  Ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances.  We evaluate the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets.  We also assess negative evidence, such as the expiration of historical operating loss or tax credit carryforwards, that could indicate the inability to realize the deferred tax assets.  Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized in future periods.  This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including future changes in income tax laws, not realizing expected tax planning strategy amounts, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. \nFair Value Measurements:\n  We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price).  We have applied this guidance to our Company's derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as \"normal purchases” or “normal sales,” to marketable securities held in trusts, and to our investments in our Pension and PBOP Plans.  Fair value measurements are also incorporated into the accounting for goodwill, long-lived assets, equity method investments, AROs, and in the valuation of business combinations and asset acquisitions.  The fair value measurement guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock, long-term debt and RRBs.\nChanges in fair value of our derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory Assets or Liabilities, as we recover the costs of these contracts in rates charged to customers.  These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy-related products in future years and assumptions made.  \nWe use quoted market prices when available to determine the fair value of financial instruments.  When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs.  Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk-adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information.  Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. \n49\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – EVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for Eversource for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nOperating Revenues\n$\n11,900.8 \n$\n11,910.7 \n$\n(9.9)\nOperating Expenses:\n \n \n \nPurchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission\n3,736.1 \n5,168.2 \n(1,432.1)\nOperations and Maintenance\n2,012.9 \n1,895.7 \n117.2 \nDepreciation\n1,433.5 \n1,305.8 \n127.7 \nAmortization\n342.9 \n(490.1)\n833.0 \nEnergy Efficiency Programs\n671.8 \n691.4 \n(19.6)\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\n997.9 \n940.4 \n57.5 \nLoss on Pending Sale of Aquarion\n297.0 \n— \n297.0 \nTotal Operating Expenses\n9,492.1 \n9,511.4 \n(19.3)\nOperating Income\n2,408.7 \n2,399.3 \n9.4 \nInterest Expense\n1,111.3 \n855.4 \n255.9 \nLosses on Offshore Wind Investments\n464.0 \n2,167.0 \n(1,703.0)\nOther Income, Net\n410.5 \n348.1 \n62.4 \nIncome/(Loss) Before Income Tax Expense\n1,243.9 \n(275.0)\n1,518.9 \nIncome Tax Expense\n424.7 \n159.7 \n265.0 \nNet Income/(Loss)\n819.2 \n(434.7)\n1,253.9 \nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n7.5 \n7.5 \n— \nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n811.7 \n$\n(442.2)\n$\n1,253.9 \nOperating Revenues\nSales Volumes:\n  A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes, our firm natural gas MMcf sales volumes, and our water MG sales volumes, and percentage changes, is as follows:  \nElectric\nFirm Natural Gas\nWater\n \nSales Volumes (GWh)\nPercentage\nIncrease\nSales Volumes (MMcf)\nPercentage\nIncrease\nSales Volumes (MG)\nPercentage\nIncrease\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nTraditional\n7,807 \n7,590 \n2.9 \n%\n— \n— \n— \n%\n1,669 \n1,488 \n12.2 \n%\nDecoupled\n43,516 \n41,978 \n3.7 \n%\n147,293 \n142,328 \n3.5 \n%\n24,308 \n23,129 \n5.1 \n%\nTotal Sales Volumes\n51,323 \n49,568 \n3.5 \n%\n147,293 \n142,328 \n3.5 \n%\n25,977 \n24,617 \n5.5 \n%\nWeather, fluctuations in energy supply rates, conservation measures (including utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs), and economic conditions affect customer energy usage and water consumption.  Industrial sales volumes are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales volumes.  In our service territories, weather impacts both electric and water sales volumes during the summer and both electric and natural gas sales volumes during the winter; however, natural gas sales volumes are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales volumes.  Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur.\nFluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings (\"Traditional\" in the table above).  For CL&P, NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, Yankee Gas, and our Connecticut water distribution business, fluctuations in retail sales volumes do not materially impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms (\"Decoupled\" in the table above).  These distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized.\nOperating Revenues:\n  The variance in Operating Revenues by segment in 2024, as compared to 2023, is as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nElectric Distribution\n$\n93.0 \nNatural Gas Distribution\n(117.8)\nElectric Transmission\n205.1 \nWater Distribution\n(3.2)\nOther\n64.7 \nEliminations\n(251.7)\nTotal Operating Revenues\n$\n(9.9)\n50\nElectric and Natural Gas Distribution Revenues\n:\nBase Distribution Revenues:\n•\nBase electric distribution revenues increased $141.1 million due primarily to a base distribution rate increase at NSTAR Electric effective January 1, 2024 and a temporary base distribution rate increase at PSNH effective August 1, 2024.\n•\nBase natural gas distribution revenues increased $49.2 million due primarily to base distribution rate increases effective November 1, 2024 at EGMA and effective November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2023 at NSTAR Gas.\nNSTAR Electric’s PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation, exogenous events and future capital additions based on a historical five-year average of total capital additions.  On December 26, 2023, the DPU approved a $104.9 million increase to NSTAR Electric’s base distribution rates effective January 1, 2024.  \nOn July 31, 2024, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $61.2 million effective August 1, 2024 at PSNH.\nNSTAR Gas’ PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation and exogenous events.  On October 30, 2023, the DPU approved a $25.4 million increase to NSTAR Gas’ base distribution rates, of which, $15.5 million was associated with a base rate adjustment and the remainder for a prior period exogenous cost adjustment, for effect on November 1, 2023.   On October 30, 2024, the DPU approved a $12.7 million increase to NSTAR Gas’ base distribution rates effective November 1, 2024.\nEGMA was allowed two rate base resets in a DPU-approved October 7, 2020 rate settlement agreement, with the first rate base reset on November 1, 2024. The increase to base distribution rates was $85.6 million effective November 1, 2024 (of which $8.8 million is offset by a reduction in the GSEP revenue requirement and GSEP rate also taking effect on November 1, 2024 for a net distribution rate change on November 1, 2024 of $76.8 million). \nTracked Distribution Revenues:\n  Tracked distribution revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy supply and natural gas supply procurement, state mandated energy purchase agreements and other energy-related costs, electric retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), certain capital tracking mechanisms for infrastructure improvements, and additionally for the Massachusetts utilities, pension and PBOP benefits, net metering for distributed generation, and solar-related programs.  Revenues from certain of these cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned, return on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings.  Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market, sales of natural gas to third party marketers, and the sale of RECs to various counterparties.\nCustomers have the choice to purchase electricity from their Eversource electric utility or from a competitive third party supplier.  For customers who have contracted separately with these competitive suppliers, revenue is not recorded for the sale of the electricity commodity, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the third party supplier.  For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from CL&P, NSTAR Electric or PSNH, each utility purchases power on behalf of, and is permitted to recover the related energy supply cost without mark-up from, its customers, and records offsetting amounts in revenues and purchased power related to this energy supply procurement.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each remain as the distribution service provider for all customers and charge a regulated rate for distribution delivery service recorded in revenues.  Certain eligible natural gas customers may elect to purchase natural gas from their Eversource natural gas utility or may contract separately with a\ngas supply operator.  Revenue is not recorded for the sale of the natural gas commodity to customers who have contracted separately with these\noperators, only the delivery to a customer, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the gas supply operator.  \nThe variance in tracked distribution revenues in 2024, as compared to 2023 is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nElectric Distribution\nNatural Gas Distribution\nRetail Tariff Tracked Revenues:\nEnergy supply procurement\n$\n(1,239.6)\n$\n(165.2)\nCL&P NBFMCC\n544.9 \n— \nNSTAR Electric net metering\n133.1 \n— \nStranded costs\n127.1 \n— \nRetail transmission\n98.9 \n— \nCL&P System Benefit Charge\n88.4 \n— \nOther distribution tracking mechanisms\n159.2 \n44.0 \nWholesale Market Sales Revenue\n33.9 \n(44.8)\nFluctuations in retail tariff tracked revenues are driven by adjustments to retail rates to recover costs and changes in sales volumes.\nThe decrease in energy supply procurement within electric distribution was driven by lower average prices and lower average supply-related sales volumes.  The decrease in energy supply procurement within natural gas distribution was driven by lower average prices, partially offset by higher average supply-related sales volumes.\n51\nThe increase in CL&P’s NBFMCC revenues was driven by an increase in the retail Non-Bypassable Federally Mandated Congestion Charge (NBFMCC) rate.  The CL&P NBFMCC rate includes the recovery of costs incurred under long-term state mandated energy purchase contracts with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants, net of the benefits received from selling this energy into the ISO-NE wholesale market.  Effective January 1, 2023, CL&P reduced the average NBFMCC rate to a credit of $0.01524 per kWh.  The rate reduction returned to customers the net benefits of higher wholesale market sales received in the ISO-NE market for these energy contracts.  The average NBFMCC rate changed to $0.00000 per kWh effective July 1, 2023 and then to $0.00293 per kWh effective September 1, 2023.  As a result of the April 2024 interim decision in the 2024 CL&P RAM filing, the average NBFMCC rate increased to $0.03906 per kWh effective July 1, 2024.  As a result of the August final decision in the 2024 CL&P RAM filing, the average NBFMCC rate increased to $0.04290 per kWh effective September 1, 2024.  The rate increases primarily resulted from higher net costs associated with power purchase agreements with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants.\nCL&P is required by regulation to purchase electric generation from Millstone and Seabrook under PURA-approved PPAs entered into in 2019.  CL&P does not have legislative authority to use this purchased output to serve its customer load and therefore sells the energy into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset the contract costs.  The net cost or net sales amount is recovered from, or refunded to, customers in the non-bypassable component of the CL&P FMCC rate. \nElectric Transmission Revenues\n:  Electric transmission revenues increased $205.1 million due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and the impact of the annual rate reconciliation filing with FERC.\nOther Revenues and Eliminations:\n  Other revenues primarily include the revenues of Eversource's service company, most of which are eliminated in consolidation.  Eliminations are also related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business in rates charged to their customers.\nPurchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission\n expense includes costs associated with providing electric generation service\nsupply and natural gas to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers, the cost of energy purchase contracts entered into as\nrequired by regulation, and transmission costs.  These electric and natural gas supply procurement costs, other energy-related costs, and\ntransmission costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on\nearnings (tracked costs).  The variance in Purchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission expense in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nEnergy supply procurement costs\n$\n(1,243.2)\nOther electric distribution costs\n130.6 \nNatural gas supply costs\n(218.8)\nTransmission costs\n77.8 \nEliminations\n(178.5)\nTotal Purchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission\n$\n(1,432.1)\nThe variance in energy supply procurement costs is offset in Operating Revenues (tracked energy supply procurement revenues).  The variance in other electric distribution costs is due to higher long-term contractual energy-related costs that are recovered in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC mechanism at CL&P, higher net metering costs and an increase in long-term renewable contract costs at NSTAR Electric, partially offset by a decrease in long-term renewable energy purchase contract costs at PSNH.\nCosts at the natural gas distribution segment relate to supply procurement costs for retail customers.  Total natural gas costs decreased due primarily to a decrease in the retail cost deferral and lower average prices, partially offset by higher average purchased volumes.\nThe increase in transmission costs was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investments and an increase in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual cost of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers.\n52\nOperations and Maintenance\n expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base electric, natural gas and water distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs).  The variance in Operations and Maintenance expense in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nBase Electric Distribution (Non-Tracked Costs):\nEmployee-related expenses (including labor and benefits)\n$\n22.7 \nUncollectible expense\n14.9 \nShared corporate costs (including IT system depreciation at Eversource Service)\n11.2 \nOperations-related expenses (including vegetation management, vendor services, vehicles and materials)\n6.3 \nGeneral costs (including vendor services in corporate areas, insurance, fees and assessments)\n3.8 \nStorm-related costs\n(4.5)\nTotal Base Electric Distribution (Non-Tracked Costs)\n54.4 \nTracked Electric Costs (Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission) - Increase due primarily to higher transmission expense,  increases in grid modernization and pension tracking mechanisms at NSTAR Electric, and higher uncollectible expense\n98.0 \nTotal Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission\n152.4 \nNatural Gas Distribution:\nBase (Non-Tracked Costs) - Decrease due primarily to lower uncollectible expense\n(14.2)\nTracked Costs\n11.0 \nTotal Natural Gas Distribution \n(3.2)\nWater Distribution\n3.8 \nEversource Parent and Other Companies - other operations and maintenance\n26.8 \nEliminations\n(62.6)\nTotal Operations and Maintenance\n$\n117.2 \nDepreciation\n expense increased due \nprimarily to higher net plant in service balances.\nAmortization \nexpense includes the deferral of energy-related costs and other costs that are included in certain regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms.  This deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues compared to the actual costs incurred.  These costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.  Amortization expense also includes the amortization of cert\nain costs as those costs are collected in rates. \nThe variance in Amortization is due primarily to the deferral adjustment of energy-related and other tracked costs at CL&P (included in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC mechanism), NSTAR Electric and PSNH, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs.  The CL&P non-bypassable FMCC retail rate increased in 2024 as compared to 2023, and the higher collections lowered the regulatory under-recovery deferral adjustment, resulting in an increase to amortization expense of \n$548.5 million.  \nAmortization expense also increased at NSTAR Electric as a result of \nan increase in storm costs recovered in rates and\n increased  at PSNH due to the absence of a 2023 benefit related to the establishment of a new regulatory tracking mechanism that allowed for the recovery of previously incurred operating expenses associated with poles acquired from Consolidated Communications on May 1, 2023.  The establishment of the PPAM regulatory asset resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $16.9 million recorded in Amortization expense on the statement of income in 2023.\nEnergy Efficiency Programs\n expense\n \nincludes costs of various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs that are recovered from customers in rates, most of which have no impact on earnings. \n Energy Efficiency Programs expense includes a \ndeferral adjustment that reflects the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the amounts billed to customers, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs. \nEnergy Efficiency Programs \nexpense \ndecreased \ndue primarily to the deferral adjustment, partially offset by higher program spending. \nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\n expense increased due primarily to higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances and higher Connecticut gross earnings taxes. \nLoss on Pending Sale of Aquarion \nrelates to the impairment charge recorded in 2024 to write down the carrying value of the water business to fair value resulting from the expected sale of Aquarion.  For further information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Pending Sale of Aquarion\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nInterest Expense\n increased due primarily to an increase in interest on long-term debt as a result of debt issuances ($220.7 million), higher interest on short-term notes payable due to increased borrowings ($16.0 million), an increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($15.8 million), and higher amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($4.1 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds and other capitalized interest ($3.2 million), and a decrease in RRB interest expense ($1.4 million).\nLosses on Offshore Wind Investments\n \nrelates to the loss recorded on the 2024 sales of our equity method offshore wind investments and the impairment charge in 2023 resulting from the expected sales of these offshore wind investments.  See \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Offshore Wind Business\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nfor further information.  \n53\nOther Income, Net\n increased due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily from regulatory deferrals ($44.0 million), an increase in equity in earnings related to Eversource’s equity method investments ($36.4 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to equity funds ($19.7 million), investment income in 2024 compared to investment losses in 2023 driven by market volatility ($5.5 million) and a gain on the sale of an unregulated water business in 2024 ($4.4 million), partially offset by a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($17.5 million).  The variance in Other Income, Net was also due to the absence in 2024 of a benefit in 2023 from the liquidation of Eversource’s equity method investment in a renewable energy fund in excess of its carrying value, partially offset by a charitable contribution made with a portion of the proceeds from the liquidation in 2023, as well as the absence in 2024 of a loss on the abandonment of land in 2023.  \nIncome Tax Expense\n increased due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($319.0 million), a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($14.5 million), a higher share-based payment tax deficiency ($1.8 million), and an increase in items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($28.3 million).  This was partially offset by a decrease in reserves ($9.0 million) primarily related to the loss on sales of Eversource’s offshore wind investments in 2024 compared to the impairment on these investments in 2023, lower state taxes ($49.3 million), and lower return to provision adjustments ($40.3 million).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – \nTHE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY\nNSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nOperating Revenues\n$\n4,615.0 \n$\n4,578.8 \n$\n36.2 \n$\n3,720.9 \n$\n3,515.5 \n$\n205.4 \n$\n1,294.5 \n$\n1,447.9 \n$\n(153.4)\nOperating Expenses:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPurchased Power and Transmission\n1,836.9 \n2,612.9 \n(776.0)\n1,045.3 \n1,154.0 \n(108.7)\n244.4 \n605.0 \n(360.6)\nOperations and Maintenance\n815.3 \n733.3 \n82.0 \n735.0 \n668.5 \n66.5 \n288.3 \n284.4 \n3.9 \nDepreciation\n406.5 \n376.9 \n29.6 \n407.7 \n372.6 \n35.1 \n154.1 \n140.4 \n13.7 \nAmortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net\n104.5 \n(500.3)\n604.8 \n130.9 \n16.1 \n114.8 \n136.1 \n(16.3)\n152.4 \nEnergy Efficiency Programs\n171.7 \n133.5 \n38.2 \n263.4 \n325.6 \n(62.2)\n42.9 \n39.6 \n3.3 \nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\n419.6 \n401.1 \n18.5 \n280.3 \n256.1 \n24.2 \n96.9 \n93.9 \n3.0 \nTotal Operating Expenses\n3,754.5 \n3,757.4 \n(2.9)\n2,862.6 \n2,792.9 \n69.7 \n962.7 \n1,147.0 \n(184.3)\nOperating Income\n860.5 \n821.4 \n39.1 \n858.3 \n722.6 \n135.7 \n331.8 \n300.9 \n30.9 \nInterest Expense\n231.0 \n193.4 \n37.6 \n222.7 \n189.2 \n33.5 \n77.8 \n72.8 \n5.0 \nOther Income, Net\n77.6 \n61.6 \n16.0 \n191.4 \n164.1 \n27.3 \n31.1 \n26.6 \n4.5 \nIncome Before Income Tax Expense\n707.1 \n689.6 \n17.5 \n827.0 \n697.5 \n129.5 \n285.1 \n254.7 \n30.4 \nIncome Tax Expense\n194.5 \n170.9 \n23.6 \n190.6 \n153.0 \n37.6 \n70.2 \n59.0 \n11.2 \nNet Income\n$\n512.6 \n$\n518.7 \n$\n(6.1)\n$\n636.4 \n$\n544.5 \n$\n91.9 \n$\n214.9 \n$\n195.7 \n$\n19.2 \nOperating Revenues\nSales Volumes:\n  A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes is as follows:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nIncrease\nPercentage\nIncrease\nCL&P \n20,151 \n19,577 \n574 \n2.9 \n%\nNSTAR Electric\n23,365 \n22,401 \n964 \n4.3 \n%\nPSNH\n7,807 \n7,590 \n217 \n2.9 \n%\nFluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings.  For CL&P and NSTAR Electric, fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms.\nOperating Revenues:\n  Operating Revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased $36.2 million at CL&P and $205.4 million at NSTAR Electric and decreased $153.4 million at PSNH in 2024, as compared to 2023.\nBase Distribution Revenues:\n•\nCL&P's distribution revenues were flat.\n•\nNSTAR Electric's distribution revenues increased $105.3 million due primarily to a base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2024.\n•\nPSNH's distribution revenues increased $35.8 million due primarily to a temporary base distribution rate increase effective August 1, 2024.\n54\nTracked Distribution Revenues: \n Tracked distribution revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy supply procurement, state mandated energy purchase agreements and other energy-related costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), certain capital tracking mechanisms for infrastructure improvements, and additionally for NSTAR Electric, pension and PBOP benefits, net metering for distributed generation, and solar-related programs.  Revenues from certain of these cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned, return on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings.  Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market and the sale of RECs to various counterparties.\nCustomers have the choice to purchase electricity from their Eversource electric utility or from a competitive third party supplier.  For customers who have contracted separately with these competitive suppliers, revenue is not recorded for the sale of the electricity commodity, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the third party supplier.  For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from CL&P, NSTAR Electric or PSNH, each utility purchases power on behalf of, and is permitted to recover the related energy supply cost without mark-up from, its customers, and records offsetting amounts in revenues and purchased power related to this energy supply procurement.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each remain as the distribution service provider for all customers and charge a regulated rate for distribution delivery service recorded in revenues.  \nThe variance in tracked distribution revenues in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nRetail Tariff Tracked Revenues:\nEnergy supply procurement\n$\n(710.5)\n$\n(253.9)\n$\n(275.2)\nCL&P NBFMCC\n544.9 \n— \n— \nNSTAR Electric net metering\n— \n133.1 \n— \nStranded costs\n6.6 \n77.7 \n42.8 \nRetail transmission\n(9.8)\n60.2 \n48.5 \nCL&P System Benefit Charge\n88.4 \n— \n— \nOther distribution tracking mechanisms\n69.7 \n77.2 \n12.3 \nWholesale Market Sales Revenue\n62.8 \n(0.7)\n(28.2)\nFluctuations in retail tariff tracked revenues are driven by adjustments to retail rates to recover costs and changes in sales volumes.\nThe decrease in energy supply procurement at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH was driven by lower average prices and lower average supply-related sales volumes.\nThe increase in CL&P’s NBFMCC revenues was driven by an increase in the retail Non-Bypassable Federally Mandated Congestion Charge (NBFMCC) rate.  The CL&P NBFMCC rate includes the recovery of costs incurred under long-term state mandated energy purchase contracts with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants, net of the benefits received from selling this energy into the ISO-NE wholesale market.  Effective January 1, 2023, CL&P reduced the average NBFMCC rate to a credit of $0.01524 per kWh.  The rate reduction returned to customers the net benefits of higher wholesale market sales received in the ISO-NE market for these energy contracts.  The average NBFMCC rate changed to $0.00000 per kWh effective July 1, 2023 and then to $0.00293 per kWh effective September 1, 2023.  As a result of the April 2024 interim decision in the 2024 CL&P RAM filing, the average NBFMCC rate increased to $0.03906 per kWh effective July 1, 2024.  As a result of the August final decision in the 2024 CL&P RAM filing, the average NBFMCC rate increased to $0.04290 per kWh effective September 1, 2024.  The rate increases primarily resulted from higher net costs associated with power purchase agreements with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants.\nCL&P is required by regulation to purchase electric generation from Millstone and Seabrook under PURA-approved PPAs entered into in 2019.  CL&P does not have legislative authority to use this purchased output to serve its customer load and therefore sells the energy into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset the contract costs.  The net cost or net sales amount is recovered from, or refunded to, customers in the non-bypassable component of the CL&P FMCC rate. \nTransmission Revenues:  \nTransmission revenues increased $69.6 million at CL&P, $89.5 million at NSTAR Electric and $46.0 million at PSNH due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and the impact of the annual rate reconciliation filing with FERC.\nEliminations:\n  Eliminations are primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business in rates charged to their customers.  The impact of eliminations decreased revenues by $86.3 million at CL&P, $86.0 million at NSTAR Electric and $38.2 million at PSNH.\n55\nPurchased Power and Transmission \nexpense includes costs associated with providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers, the cost of energy purchase contracts entered into as required by regulation, and transmission costs.  These energy supply procurement costs, other energy-related costs, and transmission costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs).  The variance in Purchased Power and Transmission expense in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following: \n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nEnergy supply procurement costs\n$\n(710.2)\n$\n(259.9)\n$\n(273.1)\nOther electric distribution costs\n43.6 \n176.6 \n(89.6)\nTransmission costs\n(23.1)\n60.6 \n40.3 \nEliminations\n(86.3)\n(86.0)\n(38.2)\nTotal Purchased Power and Transmission\n$\n(776.0)\n$\n(108.7)\n$\n(360.6)\nThe variance in energy supply procurement costs is offset in Operating Revenues (tracked energy supply procurement revenues).  The variance in other electric distribution costs at CL&P is due to higher long-term contractual energy-related costs that are recovered in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC mechanism, at NSTAR Electric is due to higher net metering costs and an increase in long-term renewable contract costs, and at PSNH is due primarily to a decrease in long-term renewable energy purchase contract costs.\nIncluded in transmission costs are charges that recover the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generation facilities to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.\n•\nThe decrease in transmission costs at CL&P was due primarily to a decrease resulting from the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investments and an increase in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network.\n•\nThe increase in transmission costs at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to an increase resulting from the retail transmission cost deferral, an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE, and an increase in Local Network Service charges.\n•\nThe increase in transmission costs at PSNH was due primarily to an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE and an increase in Local Network Service charges.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease resulting from the retail transmission cost deferral. \nOperations and Maintenance\n expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs).  The variance in Operations and Maintenance expense in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nBase Electric Distribution (Non-Tracked Costs):\n \nEmployee-related expenses (including labor and benefits)\n$\n13.0 \n$\n7.8 \n$\n1.9 \nUncollectible expense\n5.4 \n11.2 \n(1.7)\nShared corporate costs (including IT system depreciation at Eversource Service)\n5.1 \n4.0 \n2.1 \nOperations-related expenses (including vegetation management, vendor services, vehicles and materials)\n3.8 \n4.5 \n(2.0)\nStorm-related costs\n(2.2)\n3.5 \n(5.8)\nGeneral costs (including vendor services in corporate areas, insurance, fees and assessments)\n(11.8)\n3.6 \n12.0 \nTotal Base Electric Distribution (Non-Tracked Costs)\n13.3 \n34.6 \n6.5 \nTotal Tracked Costs - Increase at CL&P due to higher uncollectible expense and at NSTAR Electric due to an increase in grid modernization costs\n68.7 \n31.9 \n(2.6)\nTotal Operations and Maintenance\n$\n82.0 \n$\n66.5 \n$\n3.9 \nDepreciation\n expense increased for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH due to higher net plant in service balances. \nAmortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net \nexpense includes the deferral of energy-related costs and other costs that are included in certain regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms.  This deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues compared to the actual costs incurred.  These costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.  Amortization expense also includes the amortization of certain costs as those costs are collected in rates.  The variance in Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net is due primarily to the following:  \n•\nThe variance at CL&P was due primarily to the deferral adjustment of energy-related and other tracked costs that are included in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC mechanism, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs.  The CL&P non-bypassable FMCC retail rate increased in 2024 as compared to 2023, and the higher collections lowered the regulatory under-recovery deferral adjustment recorded in the same\n period\n, resulting in an increase to amortization expense of \n$548.5 million. \n•\nThe increase in expense at NSTAR Electric was due to the deferral adjustment of \nenergy-related and other \ntracked costs that are included in the transition and solar facilities regulatory mechanisms, and higher amortization of storm costs recovered in rates\n. \n56\n•\nThe increase in expense at PSNH was due to the deferral adjustment of energy-related and other tracked costs that are included in the stranded cost recovery charge regulatory mechanism and the absence of a 2023 benefit related to the establishment of a new regulatory tracking mechanism that allowed for the recovery of previously incurred operating expenses associated with poles acquired from Consolidated Communications on May 1, 2023. The establishment of the PPAM regulatory asset resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $16.9 million recorded in Amortization expense on the PSNH statement of income in 2023. \nEnergy Efficiency Programs \nexpense\n \nincludes costs of various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs that are recovered from customers in rates, most of which have no impact on earnings. \n Energy Efficiency Programs expense includes a \ndeferral adjustment that reflects the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the amounts billed to customers, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs.  The variance in Energy Efficiency Programs expense\n \nis due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due to the deferral adjustment and higher program spending.\n•\nThe decrease at NSTAR Electric was due to the deferral adjustment, partially offset by higher program spending. \n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due to higher program spending, partially offset by the deferral adjustment.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes - \nthe variance is due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due to higher Connecticut gross earnings taxes and higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances. \n•\nThe increase at NSTAR Electric was due to higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances and higher assessments. \n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due to higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances. \nInterest Expense\n \n-\n the variance is due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due to higher interest on long-term debt as a result of debt issuances ($26.0 million), an increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($5.8 million), higher interest on short-term notes payable due to increased borrowings ($4.6 million) and higher amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.9 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds ($0.4 million).\n•\nThe\n \nincrease at NSTAR Electric was due to higher interest on long-term debt as a result of debt issuances ($23.2 million), an increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($11.8 million), higher interest on short-term notes payable due to increased borrowings ($7.8 million) and higher amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.6 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds ($10.0 million).\n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due primarily to higher interest on long-term debt as a result of a debt issuance ($14.8 million), partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($4.3 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds ($2.8 million), a decrease in RRB interest expense ($1.4 million), lower interest on short-term notes payable ($0.8 million) and lower amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.6 million).\nOther Income, Net\n \n- \nthe variance is due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals ($19.3 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to equity funds ($2.4 million) and a decrease in investment losses driven by market volatility ($1.0 million), partially offset by a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($6.7 million). \n•\nThe increase at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals ($16.4 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to equity funds ($13.1 million) and investment income in 2024 compared to investment losses in 2023 driven by market volatility ($2.1 million), partially offset by a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($4.6 million).\n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals ($4.3 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to equity funds ($1.6 million) and a decrease in investment losses driven by market volatility ($0.2 million), partially offset by a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($1.3 million).\nIncome Tax Expense\n \n-\n the variance is due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($3.7 million), a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($1.3 million), an increase in valuation allowances ($8.8 million), higher share-based payment tax deficiency ($0.6 million), and an increase in items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($10.6 million), partially offset by lower state taxes ($0.2 million), and lower return to provision adjustments ($1.2 million).\n•\nThe increase at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($27.3 million), higher state taxes ($7.4 million), higher share-based payment tax deficiency ($0.6 million), and a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($8.4 million), partially offset by lower return to provision adjustments ($1.4 million) and a decrease in items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($4.7 million).\n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($6.4 million), a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($0.3 million), higher state taxes ($1.5 million), and higher return to provision adjustments ($3.0 million).\n57\nEARNINGS SUMMARY\nCL&P's earnings decreased $6.1 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher interest expense, a higher effective tax rate, higher depreciation expense, higher operations and maintenance expense, and higher property tax expense.  The earnings decrease was partially offset by higher revenues from its capital tracking mechanism due to increased electric system improvements, an increase in transmission earnings driven primarily by a higher transmission rate base, and an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals. \nNSTAR Electric's earnings increased $91.9 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher revenues as a result of the base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2024, an increase in transmission earnings driven primarily by a higher transmission rate base, an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals, higher revenues from its capital tracking mechanisms due to increased investments, a lower effective tax rate, and higher AFUDC equity income.  The earnings increase was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, higher interest expense, higher property tax expense, and higher depreciation expense.  \nPSNH's earnings increased $19.2 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher revenues as a result of the base distribution rate increase effective August 1, 2024 and an increase in transmission earnings driven primarily by a higher transmission rate base.  The earnings increase was partially offset by the absence of a prior year benefit related to the establishment of a new regulatory tracking mechanism that allowed for the recovery of previously incurred operating expenses associated with poles acquired on May 1, 2023, higher operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense, and a higher effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY\nCash Flows:  \nCL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities of $683.4 million in 2024, as compared to $449.6 million in 2023.  The increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to an improvement in regulatory recoveries driven primarily by the timing of collections for the non-bypassable FMCC and other regulatory tracking mechanisms partially offset by the unfavorable impact in the timing of collections for energy supply costs, the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable, a $19.9 million decrease in cost of removal expenditures, an $18.9 million decrease in cash payments to vendors for storm costs, and a $3.3 million increase in income tax refunds received in 2024 compared to 2023.  The impacts of regulatory collections are included in both Regulatory Recoveries and Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities) on the statements of cash flows.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable and the timing of other working capital items.\nNSTAR Electric had cash flows provided by operating activities of $687.6 million in 2024, as compared to $713.6 million in 2023.  The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable, an $87.4 million increase in income tax payments made, an increase in regulatory under-recoveries driven by the timing of collections for energy efficiency, residential assistance and other regulatory tracking mechanisms partially offset by the favorable impact in the timing of collections for net metering costs, and the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable.  The impacts of regulatory collections are included in both Regulatory Recoveries and Amortization of Regulatory Assets on the statements of cash flows.  These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a $9.1 million decrease in cost of removal expenditures and the timing of other working capital items.\nPSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities of $321.3 million in 2024, as compared to $32.0 million in 2023.  The increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to an improvement in regulatory recoveries driven by the timing of collections for stranded costs, net metering and other regulatory tracking mechanisms, the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable, and the timing of other working capital items.  The impacts of regulatory collections are included in both Regulatory Recoveries and Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities) on the statements of cash flows.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable, a $23.9 million decrease in income tax refunds received in 2024 compared to 2023, a $5.6 million increase in cash payments to vendors for storm costs, and a $2.5 million increase in cost of removal expenditures.\nFor further information on CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's liquidity and capital resources, see \"Liquidity\" and \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\n58",
