Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report, as well as Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Historical results and trends which might appear in the condensed consolidated financial statements should not be interpreted as being indicative of future operations.\nWe consider portions of this report to be \"forward-looking\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), both as amended, with respect to our expectations for future periods. Forward-looking statements do not discuss historical facts, but instead include statements related to expectations, projections, intentions, or other items relating to the future; forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results, or events. Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance our expectations will be achieved. Any statements contained herein which are not statements of historical fact should be deemed forward-looking statements. Reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements as these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors beyond our control and could differ materially from our actual results and performance.\n Factors which may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nVolatility in capital and credit markets, or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate, could adversely impact us;\n•\nShort-term leases could expose us to the effects of declining market rents;\n•\nWe could be negatively impacted by the risks associated with land holdings and related activities;\n•\nDevelopment, repositions, redevelopment, and construction risks could impact our profitability;\n•\nOur acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected;\n•\nChanges in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations and property values;\n•\nFailure to qualify as a REIT could have adverse consequences; \n•\nTax laws could continue to change at any time and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us;\n•\nA cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business; \n•\nWe have significant debt, which could have adverse consequences;\n•\nInsufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders;\n•\nIssuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition;\n•\nWe may be unable to renew, repay, or refinance our outstanding debt;\n•\nRising interest rates could increase our borrowing costs, lower the value of our real estate, and decrease our share price, leading investors to seek higher yields through other investments;\n•\nFailure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets;\n•\nShare ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders;\n•\nThe form, timing, and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations;\n•\nLitigation risks could affect our business;\n•\nDamage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses;\n•\nCompetition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties; and\n•\nWe could be adversely impacted due to our share price fluctuations.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements because of subsequent events.\nExecutive Summary\nCamden Property Trust and all consolidated subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, development, reposition, redevelopment, acquisition, and construction of multifamily apartment communities. We focus on investing in markets characterized by high-growth economic conditions, strong employment, and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand for our apartments and retention of our residents. As of September 30, 2025, we owned \n21\nTable of Contents\ninterests in, operated, or were developing 177 multifamily properties comprised of 60,578 apartment homes across the United States. In addition, we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future.\nBusiness Environment and Current Outlook\nOur results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 reflect an increase in same store revenues of approximately 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increases were primarily due to higher occupancy, which we believe was primarily attributable to favorable demographics with a higher propensity to rent versus buy and continued demand for multifamily housing in our markets.\nWe believe the levels of new multifamily supply in the submarkets and asset classes in which we operate are manageable and these moderating levels of supply should be met with continued demand to absorb these new deliveries. However, if this were to change or other economic conditions were to worsen, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nConsolidated Results\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders was $108.9 million and $(4.2) million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and was $228.4 million and $122.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The $113.1 million and $105.8 million increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024 were primarily due to increases in gains on sales of operating properties, as well as the recognition of a $41.0 million impairment charge in 2024 associated with land development activities.  These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and the amortization of in-place leases relating to the acquisition of three operating properties completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. See further discussion of our 2025 operations as compared to 2024 in \n\"Results of Operations,\"\n below.\nConstruction and Development Activity\nAt September 30, 2025, we had a total of three properties under construction comprising 1,162 apartment homes. As of September 30, 2025, we estimated the total additional cost to complete the construction of these three properties was approximately $269.1 million. \nAcquisitions\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we purchased the following operating properties:\n($ in millions)\nPurchase\nYear\nProperty\nLocation\nPrice\nHomes\nBuilt\nMonth Purchased\nCamden Clearwater\nClearwater, Florida\n$138.7\n360\n2020\nMay 2025\nCamden West Nashville\nNashville, Tennessee\n131.3\n435\n2020\nFebruary 2025\nCamden Leander\nLeander, Texas\n67.7\n352\n2023\nJanuary 2025\nDispositions\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we sold the following operating properties: \n($ in millions)\nSales\nGain\nYear\nProperty\nLocation\nPrice\nRecognized\nHomes\nBuilt\nMonth Sold\nCamden Royal Oaks I & II\nHouston, Texas\n$60.0\n$39.3\n340\n2006/2012\nJuly 2025\nCamden Cimarron\nIrving, Texas\n53.5\n46.3\n286\n1992\nJuly 2025\nCamden Midtown\nHouston, Texas\n60.0\n47.3\n337.0\n1999\nJune 2025\nDebt\nIn February 2025, we established a commercial paper program under which we may issue the commercial paper notes (the \"Notes\") under the exemption from registration contained in Section (4)(a) of the Securities Act. Amounts available under the commercial paper program may be borrowed, repaid, and reborrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $600.0 million. At September 30, 2025, we had an aggregate of $429.6 million principal amount of Notes outstanding under the commercial paper program which had a weighted average interest rate of 4.21%.\n22\nTable of Contents\nShare Repurchases\n \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 465,742 common shares at an average price of $107.33 per share, and a total cost of approximately $50.0 million. As of the date of this filing, the remaining dollar value of our common equity securities authorized to be repurchased under our share repurchase plan was $400.0 million.\nFuture Outlook\nSubject to market conditions, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire operating communities, develop new communities, and to redevelop and reposition existing communities. We also intend to evaluate our portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. We intend to meet our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility and through our commercial paper program, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our 2023 at-the-market (\"ATM\") program, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had approximately $1.2 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We currently plan to use our unsecured revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under the commercial paper program. At September 30, 2025, we had $429.6 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. We believe scheduled repayments of debt are manageable with contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months totaling $493.3 million, of which $429.6 million relates to commercial paper notes. As of September 30, 2025, and through the date of this filing, we also had common shares having an aggregate offering amount of up to $500.0 million remaining available for sale under our 2023 ATM program. We believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund future acquisitions, new development, repositions, redevelopment, and other capital requirements including scheduled debt maturities. We will, however, continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements. \nProperty Portfolio \nOur multifamily property portfolio is summarized as follows:\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n \nNumber of\nHomes \nProperties    \nNumber of\nHomes \nProperties    \nOperating Properties\nHouston, Texas \n8,854 \n25 \n9,531 \n28 \nWashington, D.C.

Of this amount, approximately $231.9 million related to our projects currently under construction. In addition, we had approximately $152.2 million primarily invested in land held for future development and land holdings, which included approximately $94.4 million related to land held for future development and $57.8 million invested in land which we may develop in the future.\nProperties Under Construction. \nAt September 30, 2025, we had three properties in various stages of construction as follows:\n($ in millions) \nProperties and Locations\nNumber of\nHomes\nEstimated\nCost\nCost\nIncurred\nIncluded in\nProperties\nUnder\nDevelopment\nEstimated\nDate of\nConstruction\nCompletion\nEstimated\nDate of\nStabilization\nCamden South Charlotte\nCharlotte, NC\n420\n$\n163.0 \n$\n103.4 \n$\n103.4 \n2Q27\n4Q28\nCamden Blakeney\nCharlotte, NC\n349\n154.0 \n67.2 \n67.2 \n3Q27\n3Q28\nCamden Nations\nNashville, TN\n393\n184.0 \n61.3 \n61.3 \n3Q28\n2Q30\nTotal\n1,162\n \n$\n501.0\n \n$\n231.9\n \n$\n231.9\n \n \n24\nTable of Contents\nDevelopment Pipeline Communities. \nAt September 30, 2025, we had the following multifamily communities undergoing development activities:\n($ in millions) \nProperties and Locations\nProjected Homes\nTotal Estimated Cost \n(1)\nCost to Date\nCamden Baker\nDenver, CO\n434\n$\n191.0 \n$\n39.4 \nCamden Gulch\nNashville, TN\n498\n300.0 \n55.0 \nTotal\n932\n \n$\n491.0\n \n$\n94.4\n \n(1)\nRepresents our estimate of total costs we expect to incur on these projects. However, forward-looking estimates are not guarantees of future performance, results, or events. Although we believe these expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions, future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and estimates routinely require adjustment.\nLand Holdings. \nAt September 30, 2025, we also had four undeveloped land tracts with a valuation of approximately $57.8 million. \nResults of Operations\nChanges in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period-to-period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio, the lease-up of newly-constructed properties, and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions.\nManagement considers property net operating income (\"NOI\") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. We define NOI as total property revenue less total property expenses. NOI is further detailed in the Property-Level NOI table as seen below, and is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance. Additionally, NOI as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation.\nReconciliations of net income (loss) to NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income (loss)\n$\n113,579 \n$\n(2,338)\n$\n236,940 \n$\n128,231 \nLess: Fee and asset management income\n(2,565)\n(1,707)\n(7,685)\n(5,597)\nLess: Interest and other income\n(78)\n(1,076)\n(156)\n(4,442)\nLess: Income on deferred compensation plans\n(6,749)\n(8,248)\n(16,297)\n(15,140)\nPlus: Property management expense\n8,863 \n9,817 \n28,457 \n29,057 \nPlus: Fee and asset management expense\n965 \n623 \n2,277 \n1,541 \nPlus: General and administrative expense\n19,612 \n18,845 \n59,503 \n53,692 \nPlus: Interest expense\n34,995 \n32,486 \n104,160 \n97,250 \nPlus: Depreciation and amortization expense\n159,474 \n145,844 \n460,834 \n436,540 \nPlus: Expense on deferred compensation plans\n6,749 \n8,248 \n16,297 \n15,140 \nPlus: Impairment associated with land development activities\n— \n40,988 \n— \n40,988 \nPlus: Loss on early retirement of debt\n— \n— \n— \n921 \nLess: Gain on sale of operating properties\n(85,645)\n— \n(132,938)\n(43,806)\nPlus: Income tax expense\n780 \n390 \n2,570 \n2,354 \nNet operating income\n$\n249,980 \n$\n243,872 \n$\n753,962 \n$\n736,729 \n25\nTable of Contents\nProperty-Level NOI \n(1)\nProperty NOI, as reconciled above, is detailed further into the following categories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024:\n($ in thousands)\nHomes at\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n9/30/2025\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nProperty revenues:\nSame store communities\n56,156 \n$\n374,669 \n$\n371,684 \n$\n2,985 \n0.8 \n%\n$\n1,120,199 \n$\n1,110,735 \n$\n9,464 \n0.9 \n%\nNon-same store communities\n2,703 \n15,938 \n7,505 \n8,433 \n112.4 \n40,507 \n19,370 \n21,137 \n109.1 \nDevelopment and lease-up communities\n1,719 \n1,876 \n424 \n1,452 \n*\n3,889 \n623 \n3,266 \n*\nDispositions/Other\n— \n3,193 \n7,619 \n(4,426)\n(58.1)\n18,155 \n26,795 \n(8,640)\n(32.2)\nTotal property revenues\n60,578 \n$\n395,676 \n$\n387,232 \n$\n8,444 \n2.2 \n%\n$\n1,182,750 \n$\n1,157,523 \n$\n25,227 \n2.2 \n%\nProperty expenses:\nSame store communities\n56,156 \n$\n136,786 \n$\n133,717 \n$\n3,069 \n2.3 \n%\n$\n402,377 \n$\n395,540 \n$\n6,837 \n1.7 \n%\nNon-same store communities\n2,703 \n6,144 \n3,214 \n2,930 \n91.2 \n15,499 \n9,121 \n6,378 \n69.9 \nDevelopment and lease-up communities\n1,719 \n1,352 \n255 \n1,097 \n*\n3,075 \n395 \n2,680 \n*\nDispositions/Other\n— \n1,414 \n6,174 \n(4,760)\n(77.1)\n7,837 \n15,738 \n(7,901)\n(50.2)\nTotal property expenses\n60,578 \n$\n145,696 \n$\n143,360 \n$\n2,336 \n1.6 \n%\n$\n428,788 \n$\n420,794 \n$\n7,994 \n1.9 \n%\nProperty NOI:\nSame store communities\n56,156 \n$\n237,883 \n$\n237,967 \n$\n(84)\n— \n%\n$\n717,822 \n$\n715,195 \n$\n2,627 \n0.4 \n%\nNon-same store communities\n2,703 \n9,794 \n4,291 \n5,503 \n128.2\n25,008 \n10,249 \n14,759 \n144.0 \nDevelopment and lease-up communities\n1,719 \n524 \n169 \n355 \n*\n814 \n228 \n586 \n*\nDispositions/Other\n— \n1,779 \n1,445 \n334 \n23.1 \n10,318 \n11,057 \n(739)\n(6.7)\nTotal property NOI\n60,578 \n$\n249,980 \n$\n243,872 \n$\n6,108 \n2.5 \n%\n$\n753,962 \n$\n736,729 \n$\n17,233 \n2.3 \n%\n*      Not a meaningful percentage.\n(1)    For 2025, same store communities are communities we wholly-owned and were stabilized since January 1, 2024, excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale. Non-same store communities are stabilized communities not owned or stabilized since January 1, 2024, including communities under redevelopment and excluding properties held for sale. We define communities under redevelopment as communities with capital expenditures which improve a community's cash flow and competitive position through extensive unit, exterior building, common area, and amenity upgrades. Management believes same store information is beneficial as it allows both management and investors the ability to determine financial results over a particular period for the same set of communities. Development and lease-up communities are non-stabilized communities we have developed since January 1, 2024, excluding properties held for sale. Dispositions/Other includes those communities disposed of or held for sale which are not classified as discontinued operations, non-multifamily rental properties, expenses related to land holdings not under active development, and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses, including net below-market leases, casualty-related expenses net of recoveries, and severance related costs.\nSame Store Analysis\nSame store property NOI decreased approximately $0.1 million and increased approximately $2.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. \nThe $0.1 million decrease in same store property NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to an increase in same store property expenses of approximately $3.1 million, which was mostly offset by an increase of approximately $3.0 million  in same store property revenues as compared to the same period in 2024. \nThe $3.0 million increase in same store property revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to an increase of approximately $1.2 million from our utility rebilling and ancillary income programs, approximately $0.6 million from higher occupancy, $0.5 million of decreased uncollectible revenues, and an approximately $0.5 million increase from other rental income and miscellaneous fees. \nThe $3.1 million increase in same store property expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits of $1.0 million, increased real estate taxes of approximately $0.8 million primarily due to lower refunds received, higher marketing and leasing costs of $0.8 million, and higher property insurance expenses of approximately $0.6 million.\nThe $2.6 million increase in same store property NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to an increase in same store property revenues of approximately $9.4 million which was \n26\nTable of Contents\npartially offset by an increase of approximately $6.8 million in same store property expenses as compared to the same period in 2024.\nThe $9.4 million increase in same store property revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to higher occupancy of approximately $3.8 million, an increase of approximately $3.4 million from our utility rebilling and ancillary income programs, $1.5 million of lower uncollectible revenues, and an approximately $0.7 million increase from other rental income.\nThe $6.8 million increase in same store property expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits of $3.2 million, higher utilities of approximately $2.3 million, and higher general and administrative and marketing and leasing expenses of approximately $2.3 million. The increase was partially offset by lower property insurance expense of approximately $1.3 million.\nNon-same Store and Development and Lease-up Analysis \nProperty NOI from non-same store and development and lease-up communities increased approximately $5.9 million and $15.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. \nThe increases were related to higher NOI from our non-same store communities of approximately $5.5 million and $14.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024.  The increases were primarily due to the acquisition of three operating properties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and the stabilization of one operating property in 2024, and two additional properties in 2025. \nThe increases were also related to higher NOI from our development and lease-up communities of $0.4 million and $0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024.  The increases were primarily due to the timing of lease-up for two operating properties which finished construction in 2024 and 2025. \nThe following table details the changes, described above, relating to non-same store and development and lease up NOI:\n(in millions)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to 2024\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to 2024\nProperty Revenues:\nRevenues from acquisitions\n$\n6.7 \n$\n13.7 \nRevenues from non-same store stabilized properties\n1.3 \n6.4 \nRevenues from development and lease-up properties\n1.5 \n3.3 \nOther non-same store\n0.4 \n1.0 \n$\n9.9 \n$\n24.4 \nProperty Expenses:\nExpenses from acquisitions\n$\n2.9 \n$\n5.7 \nExpenses from non-same store stabilized properties\n0.1 \n1.0 \nExpenses from development and lease-up properties\n1.1 \n2.7 \nOther non-same store\n(0.1)\n(0.3)\n$\n4.0 \n$\n9.1 \nProperty NOI:\nNOI from acquisitions\n$\n3.8 \n$\n8.0 \nNOI from non-same store stabilized properties\n1.2 \n5.4 \nNOI from development and lease-up properties\n0.4 \n0.6 \nOther non-same store\n0.5 \n1.3 \n$\n5.9 \n$\n15.3 \nDispositions/Other Property Analysis\nDispositions and other property NOI increased approximately $0.3 million and decreased approximately $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The $0.3 million increase was due to higher other property NOI of approximately $2.7 million primarily related to incurring lower storm-related expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.  The increase was partially offset \n27\nTable of Contents\nby lower NOI of approximately $2.4 million related to the disposition of one operating property in June 2025, as well as a dual-phased operating property and another operating property in July 2025.  \nThe $0.7 million decrease in dispositions and other property NOI during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was due to lower NOI of approximately $3.1 million related to the three dispositions discussed above, partially offset by higher other property NOI of approximately $2.4 million, primarily driven by lower storm-related expenses.  The other property NOI increase was partially offset by lower revenues due to an increase in business interruption insurance proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  \nNon-Property Income\n($ in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nFee and asset management\n$\n2,565 \n$\n1,707 \n$\n858 \n50.3%\n$\n7,685 \n$\n5,597 \n$\n2,088 \n37.3%\nInterest and other income\n78 \n1,076 \n(998)\n(92.8)\n156 \n4,442 \n(4,286)\n(96.5)\nIncome on deferred compensation plans\n6,749 \n8,248 \n(1,499)\n(18.2)\n16,297 \n15,140 \n1,157 \n7.6 \nTotal non-property income\n$\n9,392 \n$\n11,031 \n$\n(1,639)\n(14.9)\n%\n$\n24,138 \n$\n25,179 \n$\n(1,041)\n(4.1)\n%\nFee and asset management income from construction and development activities at our third-party construction projects increased approximately $0.9 million and $2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were related to higher fees earned on third-party construction projects due to higher activity as compared to the same periods in 2024.\nInterest and other income decreased approximately $1.0 million and $4.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The decreases were primarily due to having lower average cash balances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024.\nOur deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately $6.7 million and $16.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to income of approximately $8.2 million and $15.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans, as discussed below.\nOther Expenses\n($ in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nProperty management\n$\n8,863 \n$\n9,817 \n$\n(954)\n(9.7)\n%\n$\n28,457 \n$\n29,057 \n$\n(600)\n(2.1)\n%\nFee and asset management\n965 \n623 \n342 \n54.9 \n2,277 \n1,541 \n736 \n47.8 \nGeneral and administrative\n19,612 \n18,845 \n767 \n4.1 \n59,503 \n53,692 \n5,811 \n10.8 \nInterest\n34,995 \n32,486 \n2,509 \n7.7 \n104,160 \n97,250 \n6,910 \n7.1 \nDepreciation and amortization\n159,474 \n145,844 \n13,630 \n9.3 \n460,834 \n436,540 \n24,294 \n5.6 \nExpense on deferred compensation plans\n6,749 \n8,248 \n(1,499)\n(18.2)\n16,297 \n15,140 \n1,157 \n7.6 \nTotal other expenses\n$\n230,658 \n$\n215,863 \n$\n14,795 \n6.9 \n%\n$\n671,528 \n$\n633,220 \n$\n38,308 \n6.0 \n%\n    Property management expense, which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, decreased approximately $1.0 million and $0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The decreases were primarily related to lower advocacy contributions during three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024, partially offset by higher salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation costs. Property management expenses were approximately 2.2% and 2.5% of total property revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and were 2.4% and  2.5% of total property revenues for  the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nFee and asset management expense from construction and development activities at our third-party projects increased approximately $0.3 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increases were primarily due to increases in third-party construction activity as compared to the same periods in 2024.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased approximately $0.8 million and $5.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increases were primarily related \n28\nTable of Contents\nto higher legal expenses and higher acquisition pursuit costs. Excluding income on deferred compensation plans, general and administrative expenses were approximately 4.9% and 4.8% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and were 5.0% and 4.6% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \nInterest expense increased approximately $2.5 million and $6.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increases were primarily due to increases in interest expense relating to having higher average balances on our commercial paper program entered into in February 2025 and decreases in capitalized interest expense due to having lower average balances in assets under construction during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increases were partially offset by the repayment of a $250 million, 3.68% senior unsecured notes payable in September 2024, and lower variable rate interest expense recognized on the $500 million senior unsecured notes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increase in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was also due to an increase in interest expense recognized on our unsecured revolving credit facility resulting from higher average balances outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $13.6 million and $24.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increases were primarily due to higher depreciation expense and amortization of in-place leases related to the acquisition of operating properties in January, February, and May 2025.\nOur deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately $6.7 million and $16.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to recognizing an expense of approximately $8.2 million and $15.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income related to these plans, as discussed in the non-property income section above.\nOther \n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n($ in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n$\n2025\n2024\n$\nImpairment associated with land development activities\n$\n— \n$\n(40,988)\n$\n40,988 \n$\n— \n$\n(40,988)\n$\n40,988 \nLoss on early retirement of debt\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(921)\n$\n921 \nGain on sale of operating properties\n$\n85,645 \n$\n— \n$\n85,645 \n$\n132,938 \n$\n43,806 \n$\n89,132 \nIncome tax expense\n$\n(780)\n$\n(390)\n$\n(390)\n$\n(2,570)\n$\n(2,354)\n$\n(216)\nThe impairment associated with land development activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of approximately $41.0 million, related to three projects which were put on hold. These impairment charges represent the difference between each parcel's estimated fair value and its carrying value, which included the original purchase price and other capitalized development costs.\nThe $0.9 million loss on early retirement of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the write-off of unamortized loan costs related to the early retirement of our $300 million unsecured term loan in January 2024, which was scheduled to mature in August 2024. \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized an aggregate $85.6 million gain related to the disposition of one dual-phased operating property located in Houston, Texas and one operating property located in Irving, Texas.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 we also recognized a $47.3 million gain related to the disposition of one operating property located in Houston, Texas in June 2025. The $43.8 million gain on sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the disposition of one operating property located in Atlanta, Georgia in February 2024.\nIncome tax expense increased approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024. The increases were primarily due to higher taxable income resulting from increased third-party construction activities within a taxable REIT subsidiary.  Additionally, for the three  months ended September 30, 2025, state and franchise income tax expenses were higher as compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to tax legislation changes enacted in certain state jurisdictions in 2024.\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\"), Core FFO, and Core Adjusted FFO (\"Core AFFO\")\nManagement considers FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity REIT. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") currently defines FFO  as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and \n29\nTable of Contents\nlosses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Our calculation of diluted FFO also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains and losses on dispositions of real estate, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets, and depreciation, FFO can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company's real estate investments between periods or to different companies. \nCore FFO represents FFO as further adjusted for items not considered part of our core business operations. We consider Core FFO to be a helpful supplemental measure of operating performance as it also excludes certain items which, by nature, are not comparable period over period and therefore tends to obscure actual operating performance. Our definition of Core FFO may differ from other REITs, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other REITs.\nCore AFFO is calculated utilizing Core FFO less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. We also consider Core AFFO to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a REIT's operating performance between periods or to different companies. Our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other REITs, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other REITs. \nTo facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, we believe FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report. FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance. Additionally, FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation.\nReconciliations of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n($ in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nFunds from operations\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n$\n108,934 \n$\n(4,204)\n$\n228,426 \n$\n122,602 \nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n156,272 \n142,853 \n451,326 \n427,595 \nImpairment associated with land development activities\n— \n40,988 \n— \n40,988 \nGain on sale of operating properties \n(85,645)\n— \n(132,938)\n(43,806)\nIncome allocated to non-controlling interests\n4,645 \n1,866 \n8,514 \n5,629 \nFunds from operations\n$\n184,206 \n$\n181,503 \n$\n555,328 \n$\n553,008 \nCasualty-related expenses, net of recoveries\n(444)\n2,833 \n(1,413)\n2,769 \nLegal costs and settlements\n2,151 \n1,301 \n6,334 \n3,267 \nExpensed transaction, development, and other pursuit costs\n695 \n833 \n3,658 \n1,493 \nSeverance\n— \n— \n— \n506 \nLoss on early retirement of debt\n— \n— \n— \n921 \nAdvocacy contributions\n— \n1,653 \n— \n1,653 \nOther miscellaneous items\n168 \n— \n244 \n— \nCore funds from operations\n$\n186,776 \n$\n188,123 \n$\n564,151 \n$\n563,617 \nLess: recurring capitalized expenditures\n(29,274)\n(25,676)\n(75,340)\n(77,296)\nCore adjusted funds from operations\n$\n157,502 \n$\n162,447 \n$\n488,811 \n$\n486,321 \nWeighted average shares – basic\n108,524 \n108,426 \n108,564 \n108,513 \nIncremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of:\nShare awards granted\n56 \n62 \n53 \n34 \nCommon units\n1,594 \n1,594 \n1,594 \n1,594 \nWeighted average shares – diluted\n110,174 \n110,082 \n110,211 \n110,141 \n30\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial Condition and Sources of Liquidity\nWe intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. We intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by:\n•\nextending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable;\n•\nmanaging interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt;\n•\nmaintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios; and\n•\nusing what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity.\nOur interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was approximately 6.5 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and was 6.9 for each of the three and nine months ended 2024. This ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses, non-property income, and other expenses, after adding back depreciation, amortization, and interest expense. Approximately 90.2% and 89.9% of our properties were unencumbered at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 5.0 years at September 30, 2025.\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations. Other sources may include one or more of the following: availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our 2023 ATM program, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. We believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months from our filing date including:\n•\nnormal recurring operating expenses;\n•\ncurrent debt service requirements including scheduled debt maturities;\n•\nrecurring and non-recurring capital expenditures;\n•\nfunding of property developments, repositions, redevelopments, and acquisitions; \n•\nthe minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code; and\n•\nfunding share repurchases.\nFactors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets, changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws, sources of financing, the minimum REIT dividend requirements, our ability to complete asset purchases, sales, or developments, the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds, and our ability to access capital markets.\nCash Flows\nThe following is a discussion of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.\nNet cash from operating activities was approximately $629.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to approximately $622.5 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to the growth attributable to our same store and non-same store communities, including the acquisition of three operating properties during 2025, and the timing of four operating properties which completed construction in 2024 and 2025. The increase was partially offset by higher interest payments on our debt. See further discussion of our 2025 operations as compared to 2024 in \n\"Results of Operations.\"\nNet cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 totaled approximately $478.6 million as compared to $196.0 million during the same period in 2024. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily related to the acquisition of three operating properties for approximately $334.2 million, and amounts paid for property development and capital improvements of approximately $310.4 million. These outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of one dual-phased operating property and two other operating properties of approximately $169.4 million. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to amounts paid for property development and capital improvements of approximately $306.6 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of one operating property of approximately $114.5 million. The slight increase in property development and capital improvements for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to \n31\nTable of Contents\nhigher expenditures for new development, partially offset by lower reposition expenditures in 2025 as compared to 2024. The property development and capital improvements during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, included the following:  \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nExpenditures for new development, including land\n$\n146.8 \n$\n129.7 \nCapital expenditures\n80.1 \n82.0 \nReposition expenditures\n63.9 \n70.1 \nDirect real estate taxes and capitalized interest and other indirect costs\n19.6 \n24.8 \n     Total\n$\n310.4 \n$\n306.6 \nNet cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $146.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $652.2 million during the same period in 2024. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily related to $345.5 million used for distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders,  net payments of $178.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility, and 50.0 million used for common share repurchases. These outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately $428.3 million of borrowings from our commercial paper program.  Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to  the repayment of our $250 million senior unsecured notes in September 2024, and the repayment of our $300 million unsecured term loan and $250 million senior unsecured notes in January 2024. Cash outflows also related to $337.5 million used for distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, and $50.0 million used for common share repurchases. These outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately $396.0 million from the issuance of $400.0 million senior unsecured notes in January 2024, and net proceeds of $138.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility.   \nFinancial Flexibility\nWe have a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in August 2026, with two options to extend the facility at our election for two consecutive six-month periods and to expand the facility up to three times by up to an additional $500 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The interest rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility is based upon, at our option, (a) the daily or the one-, three-, or six-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus, in each case, a spread based on our credit rating, or (b) a base rate equal to the higher of: (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America, N.A.'s prime rate, (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.0%, and (iv) 1.0%. Advances under our unsecured revolving credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. These bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of $600 million or the remaining amount available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. We believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of September 30, 2025 and through the date of this filing. \nOur unsecured revolving credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $50 million in letters of credit. While our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, it does reduce the amount available. At September 30, 2025, we had no outstanding letters of credit issued under our unsecured revolving credit facility and had approximately $1.2 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. \nIn February 2025, we established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured Notes under the exemption from registration contained in Section (4)(a) of the Securities Act. Amounts available under the commercial paper program may be borrowed, repaid, and reborrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the commercial paper program at any time not to exceed $600 million. The Notes will have maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The Notes will rank at least equal in priority to all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuances of the Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include property acquisitions and development in the ordinary course of business, capital expenditures, and working capital. We currently plan to use our unsecured revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under the commercial paper program. At September 30, 2025, we had $429.6 million outstanding under our commercial paper program.\nIn May 2023, we created the 2023 ATM share offering program through which we can, but have no obligation to, sell common shares and we may also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering amount of up to $500.0 million, in amounts and at times as we determine, into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. Actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including, \n32\nTable of Contents\namong others, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us. We intend to use proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2023 ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the repayment of other indebtedness, the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities, funding for development activities, and financing for acquisitions. As of the date of this filing, we have not sold any shares or entered into any forward sales agreement and have common shares having an aggregate offering amount of up to $500.0 million remaining available for sale under the 2023 ATM program.\nWe believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by Moody's, Fitch, and Standard and Poor's, which are currently A3 with stable outlook, A- with stable outlook, and A- with stable outlook, respectively. We believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or life insurance companies. However, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings or borrow on an unsecured or secured basis in the future.\nFuture Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nOne of our principal long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt, including any future borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe scheduled repayments of debt are manageable with contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months totaling $493.3 million, of which $429.6 million relates to commercial paper notes. See \nNote 6. \"Notes Payable,\"\n in the notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our scheduled maturities. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we estimated the additional cost to complete the construction of three properties to be approximately $269.1 million. Of this amount, we expect to incur costs between approximately $46 million and $56 million during the remainder of 2025 and to incur the remaining costs during 2026 through 2028. Additionally, for the remainder of 2025, we expect to incur costs between approximately $20 million and $28 million of reposition, redevelopment, repurpose, and revenue enhancing expenditures, and between approximately $36  million and $44 million of additional recurring capital expenditures.\nWe anticipate meeting our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility and through our commercial paper program, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our ATM program, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. We continue to evaluate our portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise.  \nAs a REIT, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our annual taxable income. In order to minimize paying income taxes, our general policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income. In September 2025, our Board of Trust Managers declared a quarterly dividend of $1.05 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of September 30, 2025. The quarterly dividend was subsequently paid on October 17, 2025, and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units. Assuming similar quarterly dividend distributions for the remainder of 2025, our annualized dividend rate would be $4.20 per share or unit.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur critical accounting policies have not changed from the information reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024."
