We develop, manufacture, and distribute products and provide services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, dairy and water testing industries. We also provide human medical point-of-care and laboratory diagnostics. Our primary products and services are:\n•\nPoint-of-care veterinary diagnostic products, comprised of instruments, consumables, and rapid assay test kits;\n•\nVeterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services;\n•\nPractice management and diagnostic imaging systems and services used by veterinarians;\n•\nHealth monitoring, biological materials testing, laboratory diagnostic instruments, and services used by the biomedical research community;\n•\nDiagnostic and health-monitoring products for livestock, poultry, and dairy;\n•\nProducts that test water for certain microbiological contaminants; and\n•\nPoint-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers.\nOur Purpose is to be a great company that creates exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees, and stockholders by enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT\nWe operate primarily through three business segments: Companion Animal Group, Water quality products, and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products business with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.\nCompanion Animal Group (“CAG”) - \nDiagnostic and information management-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary industry, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions, outside reference laboratory services, and veterinary software and services.\nCAG Diagnostics\n \nWe provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Regardless of modality utilized, veterinarians are provided with clinically relevant data which is integrated within our information management technologies. The result is a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner.\nIn-Clinic Diagnostic Solutions\n. Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of our IDEXX VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry, hematology, immunoassay, electrolyte, urinalysis, cytology, blood gas, and coagulation analyzers, as well as associated consumable products that provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results. Several of these in-clinic analyzers, including the Catalyst One Chemistry analyzer, ProCyte One hematology analyzer, SediVue Dx Analyzer, and IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer, utilize proprietary artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities in their image capture systems to analyze samples. IDEXX in-clinic analyzers feature load-and-go sample handling and integration with a cloud-enabled software ecosystem, including the IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS. Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include a broad range of single-use, IDEXX SNAP\n \nrapid assay test kits that provide quick, accurate, and convenient point-of-care diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal disease-causing pathogens and health conditions. Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments.\n    \nBlood and Urine Chemistry\n. Our blood and urine chemistry analyzers are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions. We actively sell the Catalyst One Chemistry Analyzer and continue to support the Catalyst Dx Analyzer, both of which perform chemistry, immunoassay, and electrolyte tests. We also support the \n6\nVetStat Electrolyte and Blood Gas analyzer. Sales of consumables to customers who use our chemistry analyzers provide the majority of our instrument consumables revenues from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab instruments. \n    \nHematology\n. Our hematology analyzers assess the cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (also called a complete blood count). These analyzers include the ProCyte One and ProCyte Dx hematology analyzers. We also sell the Coag Dx Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders. We continue to offer consumables to support analyzers that are not actively marketed including the LaserCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer.\n    \nUrinalysis\n. The SediVue Dx Analyzer provides a complete urine sediment analysis. This platform features proprietary AI capabilities. The IDEXX VetLab UA Analyzer provides rapid, automated capture of semi-quantitative chemical urinalysis from IDEXX UA strips and is validated specifically for veterinary use.\n    \nCytology\n. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we launched in North America our new cellular analyzer, IDEXX inVue Dx, which detects the most common cytologic changes found in blood. The IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer uses advanced optics and AI technology in a slide-free, load-and-go platform. \n    \n    \nRapid Assay\n. The SNAP rapid assays are single-use, handheld test kits that can work without the use of instrumentation, although many kits may also be activated with results automatically captured and interpreted by the SNAP Pro Analyzer. This device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results with the pet owner on the SNAP Pro Analyzer screen, or via VetConnect PLUS. The principal canine SNAP rapid assay tests include SNAP 4Dx Plus, which tests for the seven vector-borne diseases causing pathogens, including Lyme disease as well as canine heartworm, and SNAP Heartworm RT, which tests for heartworm. Sales of our canine vector-borne disease tests are typically greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practices in the Northern Hemisphere. The principal feline SNAP rapid assay tests include SNAP Feline Triple, which tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to the virus that leads to AIDS in humans), feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”) and heartworm, and SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for FIV and FeLV.\n    \nIDEXX VetLab Station\n. The IDEXX VetLab Station (“IVLS”) connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab analyzers, and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capability. IVLS also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to VetConnect PLUS. We sell IVLS as an integral component for our in-clinic analyzer suite. In 2024, we upgraded our IVLS to work easier and faster than our previous version, providing two times faster performance on common workflows and access to historical results five times faster. \nIntegrated Diagnostic Information Management\n.\n \nVetConnect PLUS is a cloud-based technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ data from all of IDEXX’s diagnostic modalities. These integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patient-specific information, allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend diagnostic results, enabling greater medical insight and enhanced decision-making through IDEXX DecisionIQ, an analytical tool incorporated in VetConnect PLUS that utilizes proprietary technology, including AI, to aid practitioners in making medical diagnoses. In addition, VetConnect PLUS provides instant mobile or browser-based access to results, which can be printed or emailed to pet owners and other veterinarians. \nReference Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services\n.\n We offer commercial reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians in many developed geographies worldwide, including customers in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, through a network of approximately 80 laboratories. Customers use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Most test results have same-day or next-day turnaround times. Our diagnostic laboratory business also provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to biomedical research customers in North America, Europe, and Asia.\nOur reference laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in animals, including all tests that can be run in-clinic at the veterinary practice with our instruments or rapid assays. This menu of tests also includes a number of specialized tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevant diseases and conditions in dogs and cats, including parasites, heart disease, allergies, pancreatitis, diabetes, renal disease, and infectious diseases. We also offer cancer screening to aid in diagnosis, assist in therapy selection, and support therapy management and monitoring.\n7\nIDEXX Telemedicine\n. \nAdditionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine, and advisory services, including radiology, dental radiography, cardiology, internal medicine, and ultrasound consulting. These services enable veterinarians to obtain diagnostic interpretations, and radiology and cardiology assessments. IDEXX Telemedicine services are accessed through IDEXX VetMedStat, a cloud-based software platform for case submission and interpretation that embeds proprietary AI capabilities aiding analysis of images and electrocardiogram results.\nVeterinary Software and Services & Diagnostic Imaging Systems\nVeterinary Software and Services\n. We develop, market, and sell a portfolio of software and services for independent veterinary clinics and corporate groups. This portfolio includes:\n \n    \nPractice management systems\n. We provide software, hardware, and integrated services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling, client communication, billing, and inventory management. Our practice management systems offerings include cloud-based ezyVet, Animana, and IDEXX Neo, and on-premises Cornerstone. To support the software system needs of practices, IDEXX provides integrated services including Payment Solutions, Data Backup & Recovery, and Practice Supplies.\n    Third-party integrations strengthen our practice management systems value proposition by improving user workflows and can quickly add new functionality to the practice management systems. Our commercial application programming interfaces and partner management processes allow controlled access to the practice management systems platform while providing an enhanced user experience. Our large practice management systems installed base provides access to veterinary channel transaction activity, enabling a syndicated data offering. Industry pharmaceutical and nutrition partners leverage our data to understand channel market performance and to provide behavioral insights.\n    \nSoftware applications that extend workflow capabilities for practices and groups\n. We are able to improve overall patient management and workflow optimization through coordination and tracking of every step of a patient during a hospital stay. Our SmartFlow cloud offering works in conjunction with major veterinary practice management systems, including ezyVet, Cornerstone, Animana, IDEXX Neo, and certain third-party practice management systems, and VetRadar provides workflow capability for ezyVet. \n    \nClient marketing and wellness plan management\n. In addition, we offer cloud-based client communication (Pet Health Network Pro, Pet Health Network 3D, and Vello) and preventive care plan management software (Petly Plans) designed to strengthen the relationship between the veterinarian and the pet owner. To support the communication needs between general practices and specialty referral practices, IDEXX offers rVetLink software. Lastly, IDEXX Enterprise provides centralized management and reporting capabilities for groups of veterinary practices. \nDiagnostic Imaging Systems\n. Our diagnostic imaging systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. We market and sell two diagnostic imaging systems primarily used in small animal veterinary applications: IDEXX ImageVue DR50 and IDEXX ImageVue DR30.\nOur diagnostic imaging systems employ picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) software called IDEXX-PACS, which facilitates radiographic image capture and review. IDEXX Web PACS is our cloud-based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) offering for viewing, accessing, storing, and sharing multi-modality diagnostic images. IDEXX Web PACS is integrated with Cornerstone, ezyVet, IDEXX Neo, and IDEXX VetConnect\n \nPLUS to provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging results alongside patient diagnostic results from any internet-connected device. IDEXX Web PACS uses proprietary AI capabilities to enable optimal sharing, analysis, and storage of diagnostic images. \nWe believe that the breadth of our full diagnostic solution, including novel products and services developed and made available only by IDEXX, as well as the seamless software integration of our offering, provide a differentiated competitive advantage by giving veterinarians the tools and services to offer advanced veterinary medical care. We believe that with the use of our products and services, veterinary practices significantly improve the quality of veterinary care provided to their patients, increase staff efficiencies, and better communicate the value of this medical care to the pet owner. We believe that these capabilities, enabled by the use of IDEXX products and services, improve the effectiveness and financial health of the veterinary practice.\n8\nWater quality products (“Water”) \n- Water provides innovative testing solutions for easy, rapid, and accurate detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water.\nWater testing\n. Our principal products are the Colilert, Colilert-18, and Colisure tests, which detect the presence of total coliforms and \nE. coli\n in water. These organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. Our products utilize nutrient-indicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities, and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, wastewater, and water from private wells. We also sell consumables, parts, and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products. IDEXX also offers the following products:\n    \nEnterolert\n. Our Enterolert products detect the presence of \nenterococci\n in drinking, waste, and recreational waters. \nEnterococc\ni, bacteria normally found in human and animal waste, are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. \n    \nPseudalert\n. Our Pseudalert products detect the presence of \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n in pool, spa, and bottled water. \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n is a pathogen that can cause “hot-tub rash,” “swimmer’s ear,” and potentially fatal infections in individuals with weakened immune systems. \n    \nFilta-Max and Filta-Max\n \nxpress\n. \nOur Filta-Max and Filta-Max\n \nxpress\n products are used in the detection of \nCryptosporidium\n and \nGiardia\n in water. \nCryptosporidium\n and \nGiardia\n are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. We also distribute certain water testing kits manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. that complement our \nCryptosporidium\n and \nGiardia\n testing products.\n    \nLegiolert\n. Our Legiolert product is a simple culture method test for the detection of \nLegionella pneumophila, \nthe most common \nLegionella\n species in water and the primary cause of Legionnaires’ disease. The Legiolert test is designed to be used on potable or non-potable water sources with results in seven days.\n    \nQuanti-Tray products\n. Our Quanti-Tray products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Enterolert, Pseudalert, Heterotrophic Plate Count (“HPC”) or Legiolert products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presence/absence indication. Our Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS, and Quanti-Tray Sealer 2X are used with the Quanti-Tray products for the determination of bacterial density in water samples. Our SimPlate and EasyDisc for HPC products detect the total number of the most common bacteria in a water sample.\n    \nIDEXX Tecta Systems\n. Our IDEXX Tecta system instruments automate several steps in water testing workflows, allowing multiple samples to be tested simultaneously, with remote notification capability. Tecta detects total coliforms and \nE. coli\n, \nE. coli\n only, fecal coliforms, and \nenterococci\n. \nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”)\n - LPD provides diagnostic tests, services, and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve producer efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk.\nLivestock, Poultry, Herd Health Screening and Production Management\n. Our livestock and poultry diagnostic products are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services to livestock veterinarians, producers, and processors, and also directly by livestock veterinarians and producers. Our principal livestock and poultry diagnostic products include tests for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (“BVDV”), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (“PRRS”), Transmittable Spongiform Encephalopathies (“TSE”), and African Swine Fever (“ASFV”). BVDV is a common and contagious viral infection that suppresses the immune system, making the animal susceptible to a host of other infections, and impacting beef and dairy production yields as a result. PRRS is a contagious virus causing reproductive problems and respiratory diseases in swine, leading to increased piglet mortality, reduced growth, and vulnerability to secondary infections. TSE is a transmissible disease in which infected animals exhibit behavioral disturbances and a progressive loss of physical condition that precedes death. Our RealPCR ASFV Test is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) assay that provides early and accurate detection of ASFV supporting prevention, control, and eradication programs by veterinarians and producers. We also sell our Alertys Milk Pregnancy Test, Alertys Ruminant Pregnancy Test, Alertys On-Farm Pregnancy Test, and Rapid Visual Pregnancy Test for cattle and other ruminants, which can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding using milk, serum, or whole blood samples. We also offer herd health screening services to livestock veterinarians and producers. \n9\nDairy products\n. Our principal dairy products use our SNAP test platform and are used by dairy producers and processors worldwide to detect antibiotic drug residue in milk. Our primary product lines are SNAP Beta-Lactam ST and SNAPduo ST Plus, which detect certain beta-lactam and tetracycline antibiotic residues.\nOther\n - \nOur Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products and services business (“OPTI Medical”) with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.\nOPTI Medical\n.\n \nThrough OPTI\n \nMedical, we sell point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose, lactate, blood urea nitrogen and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These OPTI analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas, and other locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. The OPTI CCA-TS2 Analyzer runs whole blood, plasma, and serum samples on single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. Previously we also provided human testing solutions for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. During the first quarter of 2023, we discontinued actively marketing our COVID-19 testing products and services.\nOther Activities\n.\n \nWe own certain drug delivery technology intellectual property, that we continue to seek to commercialize through agreements with third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies, which are included in the Other segment.\nAdditional information about our products and services can be found on our website. Information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other filing we make with the SEC.\nMARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION\nWe market, sell, and service our products worldwide through our marketing, customer service, sales, and technical service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain a sales presence in the U.S. and in major regions worldwide including Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, Europe, and Latin America.\nGenerally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements, and other factors. We market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians directly in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide, generally through our direct sales force. We market our diagnostic imaging products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada.

Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through selected independent distributors. We sell our OPTI products and services both directly and through independent human medical product distributors.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nOur business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each of our three primary business segments. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, certain licensing agreements, materials and external consulting and development costs, were $219.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, or 5.6% of our consolidated revenue, $191.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or 5.2% of our consolidated revenue and $254.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, or 7.6% of our consolidated revenue.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING PATENTS AND LICENSES\nWe actively seek to protect our intellectual property rights and the competitive position of our innovative offerings through various approaches, including the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the U.S. and other countries as we believe appropriate, and we seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We also license patents and technologies from third parties. \n10\nWhile we consider ownership of these intellectual property rights in the aggregate to be important to us, we do not believe that any single patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or license is material to our business as a whole, except for licenses related to our Catalyst instruments and consumables, and we primarily rely on the innovative skills, technical expertise, customer focus and knowledge, and marketing abilities of our employees for our business success. In addition, a range of factors help to mitigate the future potential effects of the expiration of any of our patents, licenses, and other intellectual property rights on our results of operations and financial position. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n•\npublications, including peer-reviewed third-party studies, that demonstrate the performance and benefits of our products and services; \n•\nour brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; \n•\nthe breadth, quality and integration of our product and service offerings; \n•\nour existing customer relationships and our customer service and support; \n•\nour sales force; \n•\nour online ordering platform that enables direct ordering of (including establishing automatic reorder schedules for) our consumables, tests and other products by our customers; \n•\nthe applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; \n•\nour continued investments in innovative product and service improvements that result in new technologies, features, functionalities, enhancements, integrations, and/or additional patents and other intellectual property rights; \n•\nour investment in diagnostic innovations that results in new product and service offerings that are patentable and that expand the test menu for our in-clinic instruments and/or reference laboratory business; and \n•\nour significant know-how, scale and investments related to the product design and manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments. \nWe own or have license rights to various patents, patent applications, and technologies in the U.S. and other countries. These patents, patent applications, and technologies relate to intellectual property embodied in certain of our CAG products and services (including our Catalyst instruments and consumables and certain reference laboratory tests), LPD diagnostic products, and Water testing products, as well as other subject matters relevant to the manufacture and commercialization of these products and services. Although certain of these patents and licenses are expected to expire in future years, the expiration of these patents and licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations. In addition, we face robust competition as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products and services to market, despite the protections afforded by these patent and license rights.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection as appropriate, we also protect certain intellectual property (such as software and our manufacturing know-how) through U.S. and international trade secret and copyright laws. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how in many ways, including through confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and third parties with which we do business (such as vendors, strategic partners, and consultants) and internal confidentiality processes and procedures.\n \nTo the extent some of our products and services may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights, or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products and services. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products and services. Refer to “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nPRODUCTION AND SUPPLY\nCertain instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties. We rely on third parties in our supply chain to supply us, and our direct suppliers, with certain important components, raw materials, and consumables used in or with our products. In some cases, these third parties are sole or single-source suppliers. From time to time, we seek to qualify alternative suppliers.\nInstruments and consumables\n. Significant products supplied by sole and single-source providers include certain Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One consumables (other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine, thyroxine, canine C-reactive protein, progesterone, SDMA, and Bile Acid slides), LaserCyte Dx consumables, ProCyte Dx Analyzers and consumables, InVue Dx cytology consumables, SediVue Dx urinalysis instruments and consumables, and certain components of our internally manufactured analyzers.\n11\nCertain Catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”) under supply agreements that are currently set to expire in December of 2044. The terms of the agreement allow for early termination in certain circumstances. In the event of a notice of non-extension, the agreement will continue for a period of twelve years through December 31 of the twelfth year after such notice, up to 2044. We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of Catalyst chemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. The agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment. The agreements also prohibit Ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary sector, excluding the EU, other than to IDEXX. \nWe purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2034, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements. Refer to “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nOther components\n. We purchase certain other products, raw materials, and components from sole and single-source suppliers. These products include certain diagnostic imaging systems and certain components used in our SNAP rapid assay and dairy devices, livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products.\nWe have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single-source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason, or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. Refer to “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nProduct quality and safety\n. We believe that product quality and safety are essential to our business. We conduct our operations within an Integrated Management System, which encompasses our Quality Assurance program, to help ensure compliance with applicable regulations, product safety requirements and standards, and customer requirements. This Integrated Management System includes strict manufacturing processes and procedures, employee training, ongoing process improvement, product quality risk management procedures, incident investigation and corrective action procedures, and internal and third-party auditing. Our manufacturing and distribution facilities in Westbrook, Maine; Scarborough, Maine; Roswell, Georgia; Memphis, Tennessee; and the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom are certified to the ISO 9001 quality standard, and certain of our other facilities are certified to the environmental (ISO 14001) and testing and calibration laboratory (ISO 17025) quality standards. ISO quality standards are internationally recognized manufacturing standards established by the International Organization for Standardization, which are audited and certified by third-party auditors in addition to our internal self-audits. We also require our key suppliers to have quality management systems that comply with recognized industry standards, such as ISO 9001, and are aligned with our quality requirements, and we regularly conduct audits with our Tier 1 suppliers to verify control systems meet all our requirements. In addition, we make available instructions and other information to help ensure the proper and safe use of our products.\nBACKLOG\nWe do not generally maintain a significant backlog of orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.\nCOMPETITION\nWe compete with many companies ranging from large human and animal health pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health. Our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and in-clinic product providers. Our competitors vary in our different business areas and regions.

We compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Abbott Diagnostics, a division of Abbott Laboratories, and Roche Diagnostics Corporation.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nMany of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relates to, among other things, product approvals, product registrations, manufacturing, import, export, distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, product disposal, environmental compliance, and workplace safety. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.\nVeterinary diagnostic products\n. Our veterinary diagnostic products, including instruments, such as Catalyst One and ProCyte One, as well as their corresponding consumables, are veterinary medical devices under the jurisdiction of the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). Other products under FDA jurisdiction include our rapid assay products such as SNAP devices and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates. While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to FDA inspections or the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (“cGMP”), the FDA Act specifies that these products must not be adulterated, mislabeled, or misbranded.\nA subset of our veterinary diagnostic products, including our diagnostic test kits for companion and food animal infectious diseases, as well as most of our livestock and poultry products and many of our rapid assay products, are licensed and regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in and from the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product validation data, including manufacturing process and facility documentation. Following regulatory licensure to market a product, APHIS requires that each product serial be submitted for test review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval to support product registration for sale, distribution, and use within their countries. However, compliance with extensive country-specific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing and marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil, the Netherlands, China, and many other countries. We are \n13\nalso required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine which also covers our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our LPD manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France is a USDA-permitted site, and has been approved by APHIS to manufacture specified USDA-permitted products.\nWater testing products\n. Our water tests are generally not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is regulated by the EPA, the test method must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA, and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Tecta Systems, Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Quanti-Tray, Filta-Max \nxpress\n, Enterolert, and SimPlate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the EPA for use under various regulatory programs. Water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world.\nDairy testing products\n. Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”) milk-monitoring programs in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as veterinary medical devices. Before these products can be sold in the U.S., performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA-approved protocol administered by an independent body, such as the Association of Analytical Chemists Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI certification as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes. All test methods used for drug residue testing require validation by the FDA and acceptance by the NCIMS. IDEXX has two FDA-validated test products, SNAP NBL and SNAP Tetra, for sale in the U.S.\nHuman point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers\n. Our OPTI instrument systems are classified by the FDA as Class I and/or Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture, and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI products. The FDA’s Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI products categorized as Class I and/or Class II medical devices would require notification of and review by the FDA via a 510(k) application before marketing or sale of such products. These OPTI products are also subject to the regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold, including the EU Medical Device Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation.\nOther Chemical, Environmental, and Human Health Safety Regulations\n. All IDEXX products must comply with applicable global product regulations, including those governing consumer product safety and materials requirements such as the Europeans Union's Electromagnetic Compatibility (“EMC”) Directive, the European Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (“REACH”), the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) Directive, and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive. These complex regulatory requirements create risk to IDEXX’s ability to market and sell our products, our business, and our financial performance. \nIn the European Union, our analyzers and certain associated equipment are subject to the requirements of the RoHS Directive, which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. Other countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey, have implemented or anticipate implementing regulatory regimes similar to the RoHS Directive. Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are not subject to regulation under the EU Medical Device Regulation or In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation, which are both strictly applicable to human use products. However, these systems are required to meet CE certification, which require compliance with the RoHS Directive, the EMC Directive, and other safety requirements. Most countries in which we sell our products impose similar registrations and/or certification requirements.\nThe European Union was among the first to regulate and restrict the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products. These requirements include the Biocidal Products Regulation, which requires the use of only approved biocides in our products imported to or used in the European Union, and REACH, which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the European Union. Compliance with these regulations (and similar regulations that have been or may be adopted elsewhere, such as Australia, China, Turkey, Korea, and other countries) may require registration, notification, or certification regarding regulated substances, imposition of import restrictions, or in certain cases the redesign or reformulation of our products. As part of the microplastics restrictions pursuant to REACH, some of our products, including Companion Animal products, may be subject to derogation, such as labeling and reporting.\nIn the U.S., the EPA regulates chemical use similarly to the European Union. In addition, certain states have their own chemical regulations, such as California's Proposition 65, which requires businesses to provide warnings to California residents \n14\nabout significant risk of exposures to chemicals in products that are known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which may be contained in certain IDEXX products, are a subject of increasing regulatory attention. The European Union had proposed draft regulations regarding PFAS, which include restrictions and/or phase-out requirements. In the U.S., the EPA has published a PFAS rule under the Toxic Substance Control Act, requiring manufacturers of PFAS and importers of products containing PFAS to file certain information from January 1, 2011, including PFAS chemical identity and structure, production, imports of products containing PFAS, use, byproducts, exposure, disposal, and health and environmental effects. In addition, a number of states, including Maine, where we manufacture many of our products, have also developed product reporting and/or phase-out requirements. The Maine statute prohibits the sale in Maine of non-exempt products containing intentionally-added PFAS after January 1, 2032, unless the Maine Department of Environmental Protection has made an unavoidable use determination, and requires reporting after the applicable sales ban takes effect of the presence of PFAS in products that have received unavoidable use determinations. However, these bans and reporting requirements in Maine are currently subject to statutory exemptions for veterinary products and medical devices regulated by or under the jurisdiction of the FDA, USDA, or EPA, as well as products that are used for public health, or for environmental or water quality testing. \nIn addition to the foregoing, our business is generally subject to various U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and other anti-competition authorities, and we are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, import and export laws and regulations, including U.S. import and export control and sanctions laws, and laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the EU Data Act. Our products that use generative or other forms of artificial intelligence may also be subject to new and emerging law and regulations, including the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act enacted in August 2024. Development or acquisition of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve medical device, water-quality and other regulations of the FDA, the EPA, the USDA, the FTC, and other federal agencies, as well as state, local and foreign governments. For more information about the risks associated with various U.S. and foreign government regulation, refer to “Various U.S. and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business” under “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAs innovation and customer focus are important parts of our strategy to create long-term value, we aim to attract, motivate, develop, and retain talented employees at all levels who are aligned with and passionate about our Purpose by:\n•\nBuilding and sustaining an inclusive, ethical culture that welcomes, respects and supports all employees; \n•\nOffering competitive and locally relevant compensation and benefits; and \n•\nProviding growth and development opportunities for all our employees. \nBecause our strategy includes developing strong, deep relationships with our veterinary customers around the world, we have focused on growing our companion animal diagnostics field-based organization globally.\nInclusive, Ethical Culture.\n IDEXX promotes an inclusive, ethical culture that values the different skills, perspectives and backgrounds that each employee brings in pursuit of our Purpose. We believe that this culture helps drive both innovation and a better understanding of our increasingly global customer base aligned with long-term value creation. We employ inclusive recruitment practices to source highly qualified candidates, regardless of race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, or any other characteristic protected by law. We encourage and promote an inclusive culture at IDEXX, including through executive sponsorship of employee-led communities that support all our employees.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 11,000 regular full-time and part-time employees in roughly 32 countries around the world. We are an equal opportunity employer, and we aim to have talent management processes that provide equal career advancement opportunities for all our employees. \nOur policies strictly prohibit any form of employment discrimination, and pursuant to applicable law, we annually collect certain demographic data regarding our U.S. workforce, which we report in our EEO-1 report to the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission. Our summarized EEO-1 survey data is disclosed on our website. The information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other filing we make with the SEC. \n15\nIn addition, we believe that maintaining a workforce that reflects our global, culturally diverse customer base is consistent with and supports our business strategy. Our CAG business, which represents 92% of our 2024 revenues, serves veterinarians, and according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, men and women held 32% and 67%, respectively, of U.S. veterinary positions as of December 31, 2023.  As of December 31, 2024, men and women represented 41% and 58%, respectively, of our global employee population, and approximately 50% and 50%, respectively, of our global people managers.\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being\n. We offer fair, competitive compensation and a wide array of competitive and locally relevant benefits (which vary by country and region) that support our employees’ overall well-being, including comprehensive health and welfare insurance; generous time-off and leave; retirement and financial support. We have recognition programs for the purpose of acknowledging the achievements of individual and team performance. We recognize that offering best-in-class well-being programs is an important element of an effective total rewards strategy and use benchmarking and our understanding of our workforce to identify and implement holistic well-being programs that we believe are aligned with our culture and meet our employees’ needs. Accordingly, our well-being programs have strong utilization by our employee base, and we review these programs from time to time to ensure they are achieving the anticipated outcomes. We provide free counseling for employees and their dependents globally through our mental wellness partner. Interactive holistic well-being resources are available to employees globally, including monthly educational webinars, ergonomic support, team fitness challenges, nutrition programs, and self-guided courses on a broad range of topics. In addition, all employees have access to financial education and our employees, their spouses, and adult dependents in North America can engage with a financial coach for help reaching their personal financial goals. \nWe are committed to enabling managers, teams, and employees to identify the most effective work arrangements to accomplish their goals. For some teams this consists of 100% onsite work, while others employ remote or hybrid models. Our goal is to promote a positive workplace environment where everyone can contribute to their fullest potential. We strive to build a collaborative culture through in-person and virtual events, including town halls, in-office celebrations, and employee-led communities. \nEnsuring the health, safety, and well-being of our employees is a top priority at IDEXX. We provide our employees with the training, tools, and resources they need to safeguard their health, and we empower them to put safety first. Our Environmental Health & Safety (“EH&S”) team oversees the IDEXX EH&S management system and our company-wide safety programs, ensuring that all of our locations implement health and safety processes to maintain and improve employee safety, reduce workplace risks, and drive continuous improvement.\nGrowth and Development\n. We are steadfast in our focus on cultivating the leaders of tomorrow and making career development opportunities more accessible across the company. We offer in-person and virtual training; our goal is to ensure robust training development options are accessible to all levels, geographies, and in multiple languages. Our career development programs are designed to build capabilities and enable career progression. We offer multiple leadership development programs to address the needs of employees at different stages of their professional careers, including new people managers, frontline leaders, mid-level leaders and business leaders, with the goal of building their capabilities and enhancing their readiness for the next step in their leadership journey. We also encourage employees to enhance their career development through individual development plans, job-related courses and degree programs.\nEmployee Turnover and Engagement\n. We monitor employee turnover and engagement to identify opportunities to strengthen our approach to human capital management. During 2024, our overall voluntary employee turnover rate was approximately 8.5%. Our voluntary turnover among managerial employees was approximately 5%. \nWe regularly conduct company-wide employee surveys through a third party to collect employee input on our culture, their experiences, and workplace conditions. These survey results provide insights that help us to improve employee engagement. Our most recent global employee survey received a high level of response, and we maintained a strong level of engagement, consistent with prior years. We leverage the insights gained from the survey to develop a roadmap for improving engagement and retention. \nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY AND CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS\nOur operations are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, emissions or discharges into the air or water, and occupational safety and health. The ongoing costs of complying with such laws and regulations is significant and may increase in the future, particularly in the European Union, \n16\nwhere we are required to comply with increasingly extensive regulations. We continue to monitor legislative and regulatory actions and their potential impacts on the areas where we conduct business.\nIn addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we strive to reduce our environmental footprint, although our greenhouse gas emissions from our operations are not significant. We have developed and are implementing a greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy. To monitor our progress in meeting our environmental goals, we track and publicly report our environmental impact metrics, including greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. In pursuit of our goals, we have developed initiatives and multi-year projects to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, integrate sustainability considerations for new product development and design, and reduce the amount of plastic and other material waste from current products and packaging. Our most recent Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available on our website, is aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures frameworks and provides our most recent sustainability highlights for our products and operations.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur principal executive offices are located at One IDEXX Drive, Westbrook, Maine 04092, our telephone number is 207-556-0300, and our internet address is www.idexx.com.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K\n. \nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2022, and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022, is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and is incorporated by reference herein.\nWe have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the “Glossary of Terms and Selected Abbreviations.”\nDescription of Business Segments\n. We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information management-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary industry, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”); water quality products (“Water”); and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and improve producer efficiency, which we refer to as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”). Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products and services business (“OPTI Medical”) with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3. Revenue and Note 17. Segment Reporting” to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories, and our geographic areas.\nThe following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business.\nCompanion Animal Group\nOur strategy is to provide veterinarians with the highest quality diagnostic information, software products and services, and medical evidence to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient and effective practice management. By doing so, we are able to build a mutually successful relationship with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets, loyal customers, staff efficiency, and expanding practice revenues.\nCAG Diagnostics\n. We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results, which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight.\nOur diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Revenues related to capital placements of our in-clinic IDEXX VetLab suite of instruments and our SNAP Pro Analyzer are non-recurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once. Revenues from the associated IDEXX VetLab consumables, SNAP rapid assay test kits, reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our IDEXX VetLab instruments, and our SNAP Pro Analyzer are recurring in nature, in that they are regularly purchased by our customers, typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services. Our recurring revenues, most prominently IDEXX VetLab consumables and rapid assay test kits, have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales. Therefore, the sales mix of recurring and non-recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins.\nDiagnostic Capital Revenue\n.\n Revenues related to the placement of the IDEXX VetLab suite of instruments are non-recurring in nature, in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle, but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for diagnostic testing purposes. Many instruments are placed through our customer commitment arrangements in exchange for multi-year customer commitments to purchase recurring products and services.\n38\nBelow is a table showing the installed base units of our premium diagnostic instruments as of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\n(units in thousands)\nInstalled Base \n(1)\nInstrument\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nCatalyst\n74.1\n69.1\n63.1\nPremium Hematology\n51.8\n47.8\n43.1\nSediVue\n21.3\n18.1\n15.6\n(1) \nIDEXX InVue Dx was launched in the fourth quarter of 2024, with ten instrument placements.\nOur long-term success in the continuing growth of our CAG recurring diagnostic products and services is dependent upon: growing volumes at existing customers by increasing their utilization of existing and new test offerings, acquiring new customers, maintaining high customer loyalty and retention, and realizing price increases based on our differentiated products and the growing value of our diagnostic offering. We continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of real-time care testing workflows, which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit. Our latest generation of chemistry, hematology, cytology, and urinalysis instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use, faster time to results, broader test menu, and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments. In addition, we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis.\nWith all of our instrument product lines, we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on time-to-result, ease-of-use, throughput, breadth of diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ability to handle compromised samples, analytical capability of diagnostics software, integration with the IVLS and VetConnect PLUS, client communications capabilities, education and training, and superior sales and customer service. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price.\nRecurring Diagnostic Revenue\n.\n Revenues from our IDEXX VetLab consumable products, our SNAP rapid assay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our CAG Diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature. For the year ended December 31, 2024, recurri\nng diagnostic revenue, which is both highly durable and profitable, accounted for approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue.\nOur in-clinic diagnostic solutions, consisting of our IDEXX VetLab consumable products and SNAP rapid assay test kits, provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. Our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with board-certified veterinary specialists and pathologists, combined with the benefit of same-day or next-day turnaround times for most tests.\nWe derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in IDEXX VetLab instruments, and the multi-year consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument. Our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing IDEXX VetLab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables. Utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample. Our strategy is to increase both drivers. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes, as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians. \nOur in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include SNAP rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate these tests from those of other in-clinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed third-party research, as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up \nto six\n diseases at once, including the ability to utilize our SNAP Pro Analyzer. We further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnosti\nc testing.\n39\nThe prevalence of in-clinic testing, as opposed to outside reference laboratories such as IDEXX Reference Laboratories, may vary by region. \nWe attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive in-clinic offerings primarily on the basis of a differentiated test menu, technology employed, quality, turnaround time, customer service, and tools such as VetConnect PLUS that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our in-clinic offerings.\nProfitability in our lab business is supported, in part, by our expanding business scale globally. Profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve operational efficiencies. When possible, we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries, expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint. New laboratories may operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference laboratories generally may have a negative effect on our operating margin. \nRecurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased testing volumes with existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers, net of customer losses. We believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our in-clinic diagnostic modalities. Recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also increased as a result of our customer commitment arrangements, and customer gains from reference laboratory acquisitions, customer list acquisitions, and the opening of new reference laboratories, including laboratories that are co-located with large practice customers.\nVeterinary Software, Services and Diagnostic Imaging Systems\n. Our portfolio of practice management offerings is designed to serve the full range of customers primarily within the North American, Australian, New Zealand, and European regions. Cornerstone, ezyVet, IDEXX Neo, and Animana practice management systems provide integrated information solutions, backed by customer support and education. These practice management systems support the veterinarian’s ability to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives, including a quality client experience, staff efficiency, and practice effectiveness and profitability. We market Cornerstone, ezyVet, and IDEXX Neo practice management systems to customers primarily in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. We market our Animana offering to customers primarily throughout Europe.\nOur diagnostic imaging systems offer a convenient radiographic solution that provides superior image quality and the ability to share images with clients virtually anywhere. IDEXX imaging software enables enhanced diagnostic features and streamlined integration with our other products and services. Our digital radiography systems enable low-dose radiation image capture without sacrificing clear, high-quality diagnostic images, reducing the risk posed by excess radiation exposure for veterinary professionals.\nRecurring Revenue\n. Animana, ezyVet, and IDEXX Neo practice management systems are subscription-based SaaS offerings designed to provide flexible pricing and a durable, recurring revenue stream, while utilizing cloud technology instead of a client server platform. We also offer add-on subscription services such as Pet Health Network Pro, Vello, Petly Plans, and credit card processing. Our Cornerstone customer base continues to be an important driver of growth through diagnostic integrations and add-on subscription services. We continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience of all of our license-based software offerings. Our large practice management systems installed base provides access to veterinary channel transaction activity, enabling a syndicated data offering.\nWith our SmartFlow and Vet Radar cloud technology, we are able to improve overall patient management through coordination and tracking of every step in a patient workflow. Our Pet Health Network Pro and Vello software provide online client communication and engagement functionality integrated into practice management system workflow.\nPlacements of imaging systems are important to the growth of revenue streams that are recurring in nature, including extended maintenance agreements and IDEXX Web PACS, which is our cloud-based SaaS offering for viewing, accessing, storing, and sharing multi-modality diagnostic images. We derive relatively higher margins from our subscription-based products. IDEXX Web PACS is integrated with Cornerstone, ezyVet, IDEXX Neo, and IDEXX VetConnect PLUS to provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging results alongside patient diagnostic results from any internet connected device.\nSystems and Hardware\n. We differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality, ease of use, and embedded integration with in-clinic IDEXX VetLab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results. We offer \n40\nsoftware, hardware, and integrated services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling, client communication, billing, and inventory management. We also provide installation and advisory services associated with our systems and hardware placements.\nOur diagnostic imaging systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. We market and sell two diagnostic imaging systems primarily used in small animal veterinary applications: the IDEXX ImageVue DR50 and the IDEXX ImageVue DR30.\nWater\nOur strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market, and sell products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices, including drinking water supplies, with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our customers primarily consist of water utilities, government laboratories, and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support. We expect that future growth in this business will be partially dependent on our ability to increase international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers’ testing protocols. As a result, we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in Europe. Further, we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition.\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy\nWe develop, manufacture, market, and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions, and have active research and development and in-licensing programs in this area. Our strategy is to offer differentiated tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease, reproductive, and herd health and production management programs. \nOur Alertys Ruminant Pregnancy Test, Rapid Visual Pregnancy Test and Alertys On-Farm Pregnancy Test for cattle can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding. These tests provide a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples.\n \nDisease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. In addition, increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products. As a result, the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate.\nOur strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture, and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance. The manufacture of these testing products leverages the SNAP platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business, which also leverages the SNAP platform. The dairy SNAP products incorporate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection.\nOther\nOPTI Medical\n. Our strategy in the OPTI Medical business for the human market is to develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers, and related consumable products, for the medical point-of-care diagnostics sector worldwide, with a focus on small to mid-sized hospitals. We seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, convenience, international distribution and service, and instrument reliability. Similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. \nPreviously, we also provided human testing solutions for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. During the first quarter of 2023, we discontinued actively marketing our COVID-19 testing products and services. \nOur facility in Roswell, Georgia, develops and manufactures the OPTI product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte requirements of certain CAG products. We leverage this facility’s know-how, intellectual \n41\nproperty, and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the VetStat and Catalyst platforms for veterinary applications, while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change. \nRevenue Recognition\nRefer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3. Revenue” to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue.\nWe enter into contracts where customers purchase combinations of IDEXX products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires judgment. We determine the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments, we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized. We evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts.\nWe allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each obligation. We utilize the observable standalone selling price when available, which represents the price charged for the promised product or service when sold separately. When standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable, we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including, but not limited to, the cost plus a margin approach. \nOur customer commitment arrangements that include free or discounted instruments and systems, such as our IDEXX 360 program, provide customers with free or discounted instruments or systems upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. We allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices, to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer, which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer. Our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract asset within other current and long-term assets. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for products and services over the term of the arrangement. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multi-year arrangements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced contract assets and cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $7.5 million as of December 31, 2024.\nOur customer commitment arrangements that include up-front consideration paid to customers provide customers with incentives in the form of IDEXX Points or, from time to time, cash, upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products and services. If a customer breaches their agreement, they are required to refund \n42\nall or a portion of the up-front consideration, or make other repayments, remedial actions, or both. Up-front incentives to customers are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as consideration paid to customers within other current and long-term assets, which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer arrangement. If these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments, we allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases less up-front incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices, to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multi-year arrangements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $1.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\nOur rebate arrangements provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the arrangement. We account for the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the arrangement. Total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional. We allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations, including the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases, which is deferred and subsequently recognized upon the purchase of products and services. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer rebates related to these multi-year arrangements. Differences between estimated and actual customer rebates may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $0.3 million as of December 31, 2024.\nFuture market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods compared to reductions in the current or prior periods. Additionally, certain customer arrangements require us to estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases, customer rebates and other incentive payments, and price adjustments related to multi-year arrangements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition as described above.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.\nWe assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\nFor those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more-likely-than-not, a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. \nOur net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future, an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged, as appropriate, to income in the period such determination was made.\n43\nWe periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made.\nWe record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more-likely-than-not be sustained. For positions that we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that we will prevail, we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. If our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately settled, or if the statute of limitations related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change, resolution, or expiration occurs. Our net liability for uncertain tax positions was $18.1 million as of December 31, 2024, and $22.3 million as of December 31, 2023. We also accrue for estimated interest expense and penalties on our uncertain tax positions. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14. Income Taxes” in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (v) and (w)” to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements adopted and not adopted.\n44\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND TRENDS\nEffects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations\nCAG Trends\n. Global trends in companion animal healthcare, including growth in demand for clinical services, continue to support solid growth for companion animal diagnostic products and services across regions. In the U.S., average diagnostics revenue per practice grew approximately 4% on a same-store basis during 2024, faster than approximately 3% growth in overall practice revenues. U.S. same-store clinical visits at veterinary practices declined approximately 2% in 2024, impacted by ongoing veterinary practice capacity challenges from the influx of higher volumes during the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic headwinds. Our initial 2025 financial outlook anticipates a decline in U.S. same-store clinical growth levels reflecting these near-term sector and macroeconomic dynamics. Our products and services include solutions that help improve staff productivity and create additional capacity at veterinary clinics. For example, during 2024, we upgraded our IDEXX VetLab Station software and also launched our new slide-free cellular analyzer, IDEXX inVue Dx.\nSupply Chain and Logistics Challenges\n. We believe that building and maintaining a well-managed and disciplined infrastructure has helped minimize impacts of supply chain constraints, including product and component availability issues, logistics challenges, including extended shipping periods and delays, and inflationary pressures. Our proactive approach to managing our operational processes, including forward planning with a focus on working closely with our suppliers and logistics partners, enables us to maintain continued high levels of product and service availability and customer service. We believe we are well-positioned to enable sustained high growth in our businesses and to effectively manage the impacts of potentially relatively higher costs in certain areas to support these growth plans. However, there can be no assurance as to the duration or severity of the supply chain and logistics challenges or the effectiveness of our mitigating activities.\nEffects of Economic Conditions\n. Demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment, including slow economic growth, inflationary pressure, high unemployment, and credit availability. Negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending, resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics or lower use of diagnostics. Unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments, diagnostic imaging, and practice management systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians. In the U.S., we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our CAG customers. Although this data is a limited sample, and may be susceptible to short-term impacts, we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful long-term representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the U.S., providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services.\nEconomic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our Water and LPD business customers. Water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction. In addition, fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services.\nWe believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our customers partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates.\nEffect of Geopolitical Conflicts\n. The overall financial performance of our business may be impacted by geopolitical instability and macroeconomic conditions. International conflicts and tensions may result in uncertainty in the markets, volatility in exchange rates, tariffs, and inflationary trends.\n45\nCurrency Impact\n. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 22% of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and sold internationally in local currencies, compared to 21% for both the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in U.S. dollars and sold internationally, and a weakening of the U.S. dollar has the opposite effect. Similarly, to the extent that the U.S. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure. Additionally, our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. denominated revenues. Refer to “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding currency impact. Our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings, including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Refer to “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding tax impacts. \nDistributor Purchasing and Inventories\n. When selling our products through distributors, changes in distributors’ inventory levels can impact our reported sales, and these changes may be affected by many factors, which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices, which are the end users. If during a quarter or year, distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors’ inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. Conversely, if during a quarter or year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors’ inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. \nIn certain countries, we sell our products through third-party distributors and may be unable to obtain data for sales to end users. We do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors’ inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates. Refer to “Part I, Item 1. Business, Marketing and Distribution” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding distribution channels.\nEffects of Patent Expiration\n. Although certain patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties periodically expire, the expiration of these patents or licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as described in “Part I, Item 1. Intellectual Property, Including Patents and License.”\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n. The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth, and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue,” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth.” Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the current year, compared to the same period for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain business acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, or as a superior measure to, revenue growth reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers.\nWe exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility, and can obscure underlying business trends. We calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period. \nWe also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size, and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period, and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction, and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends. We consider acquisitions to be a business when all three elements of inputs, processes, and outputs are present, consistent with ASU 2017-01, “\nBusiness Combinations: (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business.\n” In a business combination, if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, we do not consider these assets to be a business. A typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition, which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business, such \n46\nas employees or infrastructure. We believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth. \nWe also use Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, net debt, gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures that should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, financial measures presented according to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility.\nComparisons to Prior Periods\n. Our fiscal years end on December 31. Unless otherwise stated, the analysis and discussion of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, including references to growth and organic growth and increases and decreases, are being compared to the equivalent prior year period. \n47\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024,\n \nCompared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nTotal Company\nThe following table presents revenue by operating segment by U.S. and non-U.S., or international, geographies: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nNet Revenue \n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nDollar Change\nReported Revenue Growth \n(1)\nPercentage Change from Currency\nPercentage Change from Acquisitions\nOrganic Revenue Growth \n(1)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCAG\n$\n3,574,044\n \n$\n3,352,356\n \n$\n221,688\n \n6.6\n \n%\n(0.2\n \n%)\n0.4\n \n%\n6.4\n \n%\nUnited States\n2,409,152 \n2,282,507 \n126,645 \n5.5 \n%\n— \n0.6 \n%\n5.0 \n%\nInternational\n1,164,892 \n1,069,849 \n95,043 \n8.9 \n%\n(0.7 \n%)\n— \n9.6 \n%\nWater\n$\n185,112\n \n$\n168,149\n \n$\n16,963\n \n10.1\n \n%\n(0.5\n \n%)\n—\n \n10.6\n \n%\nUnited States\n95,347 \n83,838 \n11,509 \n13.7 \n%\n— \n— \n13.7 \n%\nInternational\n89,765 \n84,311 \n5,454 \n6.5 \n%\n(1.0 \n%)\n— \n7.5 \n%\nLPD\n$\n122,060\n \n$\n121,659\n \n$\n401\n \n0.3\n \n%\n(0.9\n \n%)\n—\n \n1.2\n \n%\nUnited States\n22,250 \n18,961 \n3,289 \n17.3 \n%\n— \n— \n17.3 \n%\nInternational\n99,810 \n102,698 \n(2,888)\n(2.8 \n%)\n(1.0 \n%)\n— \n(1.8 \n%)\nOther\n$\n16,288\n \n$\n18,789\n \n$\n(2,501)\n(13.3\n \n%)\n—\n \n—\n \n(13.3\n \n%)\nTotal Company\n$\n3,897,504\n \n$\n3,660,953\n \n$\n236,551\n \n6.5\n \n%\n(0.3\n \n%)\n0.4\n \n%\n6.4\n \n%\nUnited States\n2,533,174 \n2,391,427 \n141,747 \n5.9 \n%\n— \n0.5 \n%\n5.4 \n%\nInternational\n1,364,330 \n1,269,526 \n94,804 \n7.5 \n%\n(0.8 \n%)\n— \n8.2 \n%\n(1)\nReported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to rounding.\nTotal Company Revenue\n. The increase in organic revenue reflects growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, including benefits from higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volumes, supported by new business gains and sustained high customer retention rates, offsetting constraints from macroeconomic and sector headwinds. Increases in our recurring veterinary software, services, and diagnostic imaging revenue, supported by higher volumes and price gains, also contributed to increased revenue. Higher revenue in our Water business was primarily due to the benefit of realized price increases and higher testing volumes in the U.S. and Europe. The increase in LPD revenue was primarily due to higher realized prices and volume growth in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by lower testing levels in Asia Pacific. The decrease in Other revenue was primarily due to lower volumes of our OPTI Medical instruments and consumables. The impact of a business acquisition increased total revenue growth by 0.4%, while the change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total revenue growth by 0.3%.\n48\nThe following table presents our consolidated Company results of operations:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\nTotal Company - Results of Operations\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\nPercent of Revenue\n2023\nPercent of Revenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues\n$\n3,897,504 \n \n$\n3,660,953 \n$\n236,551 \n6.5 \n%\nCost of revenue\n1,518,577 \n \n1,470,983 \n47,594 \n3.2 \n%\nGross profit\n2,378,927 \n61.0 \n%\n2,189,970 \n59.8 \n%\n188,957 \n8.6 \n%\nOperating Expenses:\nSales and marketing\n588,507 \n15.1 \n%\n566,066 \n15.5 \n%\n22,441 \n4.0 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n442,291 \n11.3 \n%\n335,825 \n9.2 \n%\n106,466 \n31.7 \n%\nResearch and development\n219,792 \n5.6 \n%\n190,951 \n5.2 \n%\n28,841 \n15.1 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n1,250,590 \n32.1 \n%\n1,092,842 \n29.9 \n%\n157,748 \n14.4 \n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n1,128,337 \n29.0 \n%\n$\n1,097,128 \n30.0 \n%\n$\n31,209 \n2.8 \n%\nGross Profit\n.

The increase in the gross profit margin reflected favorable business mix, the benefit from price realization offsetting inflationary cost impacts, lower instrument costs, and software and services margin gains. The change in foreign currency exchange rates on the gross profit margin was not significant.\nOperating Expenses\n. Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related, meeting, and travel costs. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to a $61.5 million expense related to an ongoing litigation matter, the comparison to the prior year benefit of a $16 million customer contract resolution gain, higher information technology and outside services, and acquisition-related costs. Research and development expense increased primarily due to higher project costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates was not significant to operating expense growth.\n49\n Companion Animal Group\n \nThe following table presents revenue by product and service category for CAG: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nNet Revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\nDollar Change\nReported Revenue Growth \n(1)\nPercentage Change from Currency\nPercentage Change from Acquisitions\nOrganic Revenue Growth \n(1)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCAG Diagnostics recurring revenue:\n$\n3,129,492\n \n$\n2,935,425\n \n$\n194,067\n \n6.6\n \n%\n(0.2\n \n%)\n—\n \n6.8\n \n%\nIDEXX VetLab consumables\n1,303,250 \n1,188,261 \n114,989 \n9.7 \n%\n(0.3 \n%)\n— \n10.0 \n%\nRapid assay products\n359,754 \n344,494 \n15,260 \n4.4 \n%\n(0.3 \n%)\n— \n4.7 \n%\nReference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services\n1,336,121 \n1,278,617 \n57,504 \n4.5 \n%\n(0.1 \n%)\n— \n4.6 \n%\nCAG Diagnostics services and accessories\n130,367 \n124,053 \n6,314 \n5.1 \n%\n(0.4 \n%)\n— \n5.5 \n%\nCAG Diagnostics capital - instruments\n$\n131,928\n \n$\n137,603\n \n$\n(5,675)\n(4.1\n \n%)\n(0.8\n \n%)\n—\n \n(3.4\n \n%)\nVeterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems:\n$\n312,624\n \n$\n279,328\n \n$\n33,296\n \n11.9\n \n%\n(0.1\n \n%)\n4.7\n \n%\n7.3\n \n%\nRecurring revenue\n250,359 \n214,597 \n35,762 \n16.7 \n%\n— \n6.0 \n%\n10.7 \n%\nSystems and hardware\n62,265 \n64,731 \n(2,466)\n(3.8 \n%)\n(0.1 \n%)\n0.3 \n%\n(4.0 \n%)\nNet CAG revenue\n$\n3,574,044\n \n$\n3,352,356\n \n$\n221,688\n \n6.6\n \n%\n(0.2\n \n%)\n0.4 \n%\n6.4\n \n%\n(1)  \nReported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to rounding.\nCAG Diagnostics Recurring Revenue\n. \nThe increase in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue was primarily due to higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volumes, supported by new business gains and sustained high customer retention rates, offsetting constraints from macroeconomic and sector headwinds.

The increase in the gross profit margin reflected favorable business mix, the benefit from price realization offsetting inflationary cost impacts, lower instrument costs, and software and services margin gains. The change in foreign currency exchange rates on the gross profit margin was not significant.\nOperating Expenses\n. Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related, meeting, and travel costs. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to a $61.5 million expense related to an ongoing litigation matter, the comparison to the prior year benefit of a $16 million customer contract resolution gain, higher information technology and outside services, and acquisition-related costs. Research and development expense increased primarily due to higher project costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates was not significant to operating expense growth.\n51\n \nWater\nThe following table presents the Water segment results of operations:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\nResults of Operations\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\nPercent of Revenue\n2023\nPercent of Revenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues\n$\n185,112 \n$\n168,149 \n$\n16,963 \n10.1 \n%\nCost of revenue\n55,101 \n52,148 \n2,953 \n5.7 \n%\nGross profit\n130,011 \n70.2 \n%\n116,001 \n69.0 \n%\n14,010 \n12.1 \n%\nOperating Expenses:\nSales and marketing\n23,149 \n12.5 \n%\n21,249 \n12.6 \n%\n1,900 \n8.9 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n16,873 \n9.1 \n%\n15,655 \n9.3 \n%\n1,218 \n7.8 \n%\nResearch and development\n5,456 \n2.9 \n%\n4,757 \n2.8 \n%\n699 \n14.7 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n45,478 \n24.6 \n%\n41,661 \n24.8 \n%\n3,817 \n9.2 \n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n84,533 \n45.7 \n%\n$\n74,340 \n44.2 \n%\n$\n10,193 \n13.7 \n%\nRevenue\n. The increase in our Water business revenue was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes. The increase in volumes in the U.S. and Europe was largely from our Colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and \nE. coli\n testing, and, to a lesser extent, placements of our Tecta system instruments. \nThe \nchange in foreign currency exchange rates\n decreased revenue growth by 0.5%.\nGross Profit\n. Gross profit for Water increased due to higher revenue, and a 120 basis point increase in the gross profit margin. The increase in the gross profit margin was primarily due to higher realized prices and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher product costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates on the gross profit margin was not significant.\nOperating Expenses\n. \nSales and marketing expense increased p\nrimarily due to higher personnel-related costs and marketing expenses. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs and an increase in bad debt expense. Research and development expense increased primarily due to higher project and outside services costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates was not significant to operating expense growth.\n52\n \nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy\nThe following table presents the LPD segment results of operations:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\nResults of Operations\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\nPercent of Revenue\n2023\nPercent of Revenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues\n$\n122,060 \n$\n121,659 \n$\n401 \n0.3 \n%\nCost of revenue\n59,500 \n56,219 \n3,281 \n5.8 \n%\nGross profit\n62,560 \n51.3 \n%\n65,440 \n53.8 \n%\n(2,880)\n(4.4 \n%)\nOperating Expenses:\nSales and marketing\n28,027 \n23.0 \n%\n25,798 \n21.2 \n%\n2,229 \n8.6 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n16,716 \n13.7 \n%\n17,174 \n14.1 \n%\n(458)\n(2.7 \n%)\nResearch and development\n11,184 \n9.2 \n%\n12,493 \n10.3 \n%\n(1,309)\n(10.5 \n%)\nTotal operating expenses\n55,927 \n45.8 \n%\n55,465 \n45.6 \n%\n462 \n0.8 \n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n6,633 \n5.4 \n%\n$\n9,975 \n8.2 \n%\n$\n(3,342)\n(33.5 \n%)\nRevenue\n. \nThe increase in revenue was primarily due to volume growth in the U.S and Europe, and higher realized prices, partially offset by lower testing and herd health screening levels in Asia Pacific. The \nchange in foreign currency exchange rates\n decreased revenue growth by 0.9%.\nGross Profit\n. The decrease in LPD gross profit was primarily due to a 250 basis point d\necrease in the gross profit margin. The decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily due to higher product and distribution costs and unfavorable business mix, partially offs\net by higher realized prices. The change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased the gross profit margin by approximately 30 basis points, including the impact of higher hedge gains in the current year compared to the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\n. \nSales and marketing expense \nincreased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs. General and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower personnel-related costs. Research and development expense decreased primarily due to lower project costs. The change in foreign currency exchange rates was not significant to operating expense growth.\n53\nOther\nThe following table presents the Other results of operations:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nChange\nResults of Operations\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\nPercent of Revenue\n2023\nPercent of Revenue\nAmount\nPercentage\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues\n$\n16,288 \n$\n18,789 \n$\n(2,501)\n(13.3 \n%)\nCost of revenue\n9,112 \n12,686 \n(3,574)\n(28.2 \n%)\nGross profit\n7,176 \n44.1 \n%\n6,103 \n32.5 \n%\n1,073 \n17.6 \n%\nOperating Expenses:\nSales and marketing\n1,160 \n7.1 \n%\n1,761 \n9.4 \n%\n(601)\n(34.1 \n%)\nGeneral and administrative\n6,504 \n39.9 \n%\n3,295 \n17.5 \n%\n3,209 \n97.4 \n%\nResearch and development\n757 \n4.6 \n%\n974 \n5.2 \n%\n(217)\n(22.3 \n%)\nTotal operating expenses\n8,421 \n51.7 \n%\n6,030 \n32.1 \n%\n2,391 \n39.7 \n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n(1,245)\n(7.6 \n%)\n$\n73 \n0.4 \n%\n$\n(1,318)\n(1,805.5 \n%)\nRevenue\n. The decrease in Other \nrevenue was primarily due to lower sales of our OPTI Medical instruments and consumables, partially offset by higher realized prices. \nGross Profit\n. Gross profit increased due to a 1,160 basis point increase in the gross profit margin, which offset the impact of lower revenues. The increase in the gross profit margin was primarily due to lower product costs and higher realized prices. The overall change in foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on the gross profit margin.\nOperating Expenses\n. Sales and marketing expense decreased due to lower personnel-related costs. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher foreign currency transaction losses compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange losses on settlements for all operating segments are reported within our Other segment. Research and development expense decreased primarily due to lower development activities that were not related to our three primary business segments.\nNon-Operating Items\nInterest Expense and Income\n. Interest expense was $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $41.6 million for the prior year. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average debt levels and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates. Interest income was $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $5.6 million for the prior year. This increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in money market investments throughout the current year, as compared to the prior year.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n. Our effective income tax rate was 20.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, was lower than the prior year primarily due to increased benefits related to share-based compensation. Our projected effective tax rate for 2025 is approximately 21.5%. This increase in the projected 2025 effective tax rate is primarily due to estimated reductions in tax benefits, compared to 2024, from share-based compensation and from the release of tax reserves related to uncertain tax positions.\n54\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, proceeds from long-term senior note financings, and amounts available under our Credit Facility. We generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our companion animal, livestock, poultry, dairy, and water products and services, consulting services, and other various systems and services. Our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees, inventory and supplies, repurchase of our common stock, taxes, research and development, capital expenditures, rents, occupancy-related charges, interest expense, and business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2024, we had $288.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $453.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Working capital totaled $332.0 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $543.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The change in working capital is primarily due to lower cash and higher current amount payable of our Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2024, we had a remaining borrowing availability of $998.1 million under our $1.25 billion Credit Facility, with $250.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under our Credit Facility is reduced by $1.9 million for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months. We believe that these resources, coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing, will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future. We may enter into new financing arrangements or refinance or retire existing debt in the future depending on market conditions. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to raise capital in the U.S. through the incurrence of debt or equity issuances, which we may not be able to complete on favorable terms or at all. In addition, these alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings. \nWe manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash and cash equivalents are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S.     \nThe following table presents cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nCash and cash equivalents\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n \n \nU.S.\n$\n145,118 \n$\n324,434 \nForeign\n143,148 \n129,498 \nTotal\n$\n288,266 \n$\n453,932 \n \n \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in U.S. dollars by our foreign subsidiaries\n$\n10,623 \n$\n13,170 \nOf the $288.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of December 31, 2024, $148.7 million was held as bank deposits at a diversified group of institutions, primarily systemically important banks, and $139.6 million was held in a U.S. government money market fund. Of the $453.9 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of December 31, 2023, $163.1 million was held as bank deposits at a diversified group of institutions, primarily systemically important banks, and $290.8 million was held in a U.S. government money market fund. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024, included approximately USD $1.0 million in cash denominated in non-U.S. currencies held in a country with currency control restrictions, which limit our ability to transfer funds outside of the country in which they are held without incurring costs. The currency control restricted cash is generally available for use within the country where it is held.\n55\nThe following table presents additional key information concerning working capital:\n \nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2024\nJune 30,\n2024\nMarch 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n \n \n \nDays sales outstanding \n(1)\n47.1 \n48.9 \n47.3 \n45.7 \n46.1 \nInventory turns \n(2)\n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.4 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n(1)     Days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter, the result of which is then multiplied by 91.25 days.\n(2)     Inventory turns are calculated as the ratio our inventory-related cost of revenue for the quarter multiplied by four, divided by the average inventory balances at the beginning and end of each quarter.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table presents cash provided (used): \n(in thousands)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDollar Change\n \n \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n929,001 \n$\n906,510 \n$\n22,491 \nNet cash used by investing activities\n(207,062)\n(125,254)\n(81,808)\nNet cash used by financing activities\n(878,073)\n(441,996)\n(436,077)\nNet effect of changes in exchange rates on cash\n(9,532)\n2,126 \n(11,658)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(165,666)\n$\n341,386 \n$\n(507,052)\nOperating Activities\n. The increase in cash provided by operating activities of $22.5 million during 2024, compared to 2023, was primarily due to higher net income, net of noncash revenues and expenses, including a $61.5 million charge related to an ongoing litigation matter, and a comparative benefit from the use of cash during the prior year for a $15.0 million milestone payment to license intellectual property. Noncash adjustments to net income for net deferred tax benefits were comparatively lower for the current year. These relative increases in cash from operations were partially offset by higher income tax and annual employee incentive program payments during the current year.  \nThe following table presents cash flow impacts from changes in operating assets and liabilities: \n(in thousands)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDollar Change\n \n \nAccounts receivable\n$\n(28,280)\n$\n(53,871)\n$\n25,591 \nInventories\n(28,001)\n(28,651)\n650 \nAccounts payable\n8,086 \n(557)\n8,643 \nDeferred revenue\n(4,378)\n(3,032)\n(1,346)\nOther assets and liabilities\n(80,665)\n13,682 \n(94,347)\nTotal change in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities\n$\n(133,238)\n$\n(72,429)\n$\n(60,809)\nCash used due to changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, increased $60.8 million. Cash used for other assets and liabilities increased $94.3 million primarily due to higher tax payments and higher annual employee incentive program payments, compared to the prior year. Uses of cash were partially offset by higher non-cash operating expenses recorded as accrued liabilities, including a $61.5 million accrued expense related to an ongoing litigation matter, and by a comparative benefit from the use of cash during the prior year for a $15.0 million milestone payment to license intellectual property. Cash used for accounts receivable decreased $25.6 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of customer payments received, partially offset by higher revenue.\nWe have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned.\n56\nInvesting Activities\n.\n \nCash used by investing activities was $207.1 million during 2024, compared to $125.3 million used during 2023. The increase in cash used by investing activities during 2024, compared to 2023, was primarily due to the acquisition of a software business during the current year.\nOur total capital expenditure plan for 2025 is estimated to be approximately $160.0 million, which includes capital investments in manufacturing and operations facilities to support growth, as well as investments in customer-facing software development.\nFinancing Activities\n. Cash used by financing activities was $878.1 million during 2024, compared to $442.0 million used during 2023. The increase in cash used was primarily due to $837.0 million of repurchases of our common stock during the current year, including the 1% excise tax paid on certain stock repurchases, compared to $71.9 million used for repurchases during the prior year. This increase in cash used by financing was partially offset by no borrowings or repayments under our Credit Facility during the current year, compared to repayments of $329.0 million under our Credit Facility during the prior year.\nRepurchases of our common stock vary depending upon the level of other investing and deployment activities, as well as share price and prevailing interest rates. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders, and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. We primarily fund our share repurchases with cash generated from operations, as well as from various capital market activities, including the committed available financing through our Credit Facility. C\nash used to repurchase shares of our common s\ntock increased by $765.1 million\n during 2024\n, compared to 2023. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20. Repurchases of Common Stock” for additional information about our share repurchases. We currently anticipate approximately $1.5 billion of share repurchases in 2025, subject to market conditions.\nThe aggregate principal amounts of our 2025 Series C Notes will become due and payable on June 18, 2025, and the aggregate principal amounts of our 2025 Series B Notes will become due and payable on December 11, 2025. We anticipate paying off our 2025 Series C Notes for €88.9 million when due in June 2025, and our 2025 Series B Notes for $75.0 million when due in December 2025, with available cash on hand, borrowings under our Credit Facility, or proceeds from the issuance of new notes, or a combination thereof. Should we elect to prepay any of our senior notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable Senior Note Agreements. Additionally, in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company, the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the Senior Note Agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes. \nUnder the $1.25 billion Credit Facility, the $1.0 billion unsecured credit line matures on December 9, 2026, and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. On October 20, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the term lenders thereunder provided us, as borrower, an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan matures on October 20, 2025. The net proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay previously incurred revolver borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Term Loan is subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default as the borrowings previously incurred pursuant to the Credit Facility. The applicable interest rate for the Term Loan is consistent with our line of credit, and is calculated at a per annum rate equal to either (at our option) (1) a prime rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, (2) an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (3) an adjusted daily simple SOFR rate, plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, Debt” for additional information about our applicable interest rates on our Credit Facility. Under the Credit Facility, we also pay quarterly commitment fees ranging from 0.075% to 0.25%, based on our leverage ratio, on any unused commitment.\n57\nUnder the Credit Facility, the net repayment and borrowing activity resulted in increased cash used of $329.0 million during 2024, compared to 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we had $250.0 million outstanding on our line of credit, all of which was on our $250.0 million Term Loan under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had $250.0 million outstanding on our line of credit and a $250.0 million Term Loan, all of which was on our $250.0 million Term Loan under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under the Credit Facility was further reduced by $1.9 million and $1.5 million for letters of credit that were issued primarily in connection with our workers' compensation policy as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, and certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation not to exceed 3.5-to-1. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (“ERISA”), the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness, and a change of control default.\nThe obligations under the senior notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable Senior Note Agreements, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency-related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under ERISA, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, and cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness.\nRefer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, Debt” for additional information about our Credit Facility, Senior Notes, and Senior Note Agreements.\nEffect of Currency Translation on Cash\n. The net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. These changes will fluctuate each year as the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the value of foreign currencies changes. The value of a currency depends on many factors, including interest rates, and the issuing governments' debt levels and strength of economy.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for letters of credit and third-party guarantees, as reflected in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13 Debt” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note 16. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.\n58\nFinancial Covenant\n. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, as defined in the Senior Note Agreements and Credit Facility, not to exceed 3.5-to-1.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.”\nFor more information on our future lease payments, refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8. Lease Commitments” for our minimum lease payment schedule. The expected timing of payments of our leases may be different in future years, depending on decisions to extend lease terms and/or enter into additional leases in the preceding years. \nFor more information on our future Swiss defined benefit pension plans payments, refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 23. IDEXX Retirement and Incentive Savings Plan” for our future benefits expected to be paid.\nAs of December 31, 2024, current liabilities include $250.0 million outstanding borrowing on our Credit Facility and the current portion of long-term debt of $167.8 million recorded as current liabilities. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13. Debt” for more information about our Credit Facility and for more information on our repayment of our Senior Notes.\nWe also have purchase obligations that include agreements and purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are contractually enforceable and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, pricing, and approximate timing of purchases. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $211.0 million in purchase obligations due in 2025. Our purchase obligations beyond 2025 are approximately $168.7 million. These purchase obligation amounts do not \n59\ninclude amounts recorded in accounts payable, as of December 31, 2024. The expected timing of payments of our purchase obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. \nAdditionally, we have agreements with third parties that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and, based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we did not record any liabilities for these obligations as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and do not anticipate any future payments for these guarantees.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we paid our remaining obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for $21.8 million. For information on our unrecognized tax benefits, refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14. Income Taxes.”\n \n60",
