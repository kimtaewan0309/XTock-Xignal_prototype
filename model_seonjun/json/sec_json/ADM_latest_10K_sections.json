Internal capabilities and acquisitions expand the Company’s ability to unlock the potential of nature and serve customers’ evolving and expanding needs through its offerings of innovative ingredients for all segments. \nSource and Availability of Raw Materials\nA significant majority of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities. In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors. In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis. The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials. \n8\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\nSome of the principal crops that ADM sources and processes present specific climate change risks. For example, South American soy and global palm present risks of deforestation due to their proximity to the forest and other high-carbon-value landscapes. In addition, when not managed appropriately, row crops such as corn, soy, wheat, and canola present environmental risks such as water quality impairment, erosion, soil degradation, and GHG emissions. However, these crops also present an opportunity to combat climate change through their ability to sequester carbon in the soil using regenerative agricultural practices. In 2022, ADM launched its “re: generations” program to engage and encourage growers in its supply chain to implement regenerative agriculture practices. In the first year of the program, the Company exceeded its goal to enroll one million acres. The Company has since expanded its regenerative agriculture program to cover more than 2.8 million acres across 18 U.S. states and Canada and has also extended the program into new geographies, launching regenerative agriculture projects in Europe and South America, with a goal to enroll five million acres globally by the end of 2025.\nUnder the stewardship of ADM’s Board of Directors, the Company has established several key social and environmental policies that collectively outline expectations for its employees, business partners and contractors, and the Company as a whole with respect to its sourcing operations. These policies set the standards that govern the Company’s approach to environmental stewardship, employee conduct, and raw material sourcing, among other areas, and outline ADM’s positions on issues of widespread public interest. These standards are included in, among others, the Company’s Code of Conduct; Environment, Health, and Safety Policy; Human Rights Policy; Commitment to Protect Forests, Biodiversity, and Communities; Statement on Genetically Modified Organisms; Statement on Animal Testing; Commitment to Anti-Corruption Compliance; Protocol for Managing Supplier Non-Compliance and ADM Supplier Expectations, all of which are available on the Company’s website (see Item 1, Business - Available Information).\nIn addition to policies, a portion of the Company’s commodity sourcing is conducted using third-party certification programs including ADM Responsible Soy, Biomass Biofuel Sustainability Voluntary Scheme, Round Table for Responsible Soy, International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil, and U.S. Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol. These programs have standards that are established to provide transparency on specific sustainability-related criteria. ADM procures canola, soybeans, and palm under these programs.\nTrademarks, Brands, Recipes, and other Intellectual Property\nThe Company owns trademarks, brands, recipes, and other intellectual property including patents, with a net book value of $660 million as of December 31, 2024. More than 90% of these intangibles are in the Nutrition segment which is not materially dependent upon any individual trademark, brand, recipe or other intellectual property.\nSeasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers\nThere is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains. The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world. Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.\n \nThe prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements. Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months. Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.\nNo material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. \n9\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\nCompetition\nThe Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company. Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio. The Company’s Nutrition business is a vertically integrated business that provides ingredients and solutions for humans, animals, and pets in a highly competitive environment with a variety of companies offering the same products and services. The industry includes ingredient suppliers, contract manufacturers, global fast moving consumer goods companies, and private label brands, as well as smaller companies that specialize in specific niche markets. The Company focuses on staying ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and science-based solutions, building direct-to-consumer sales channels and focusing on consumer needs, expanding into new markets, building strategic partnerships, leveraging data and technology, and building a strong distribution network. \nResearch, Creation, Design, and Development (R&D)\nR&D expense, net of reimbursements of government grants, for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $269 million.\nThe Company is committed to global health and sustainable products, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. ADM\n’\ns R&D efforts focus on creating science-based products, solutions, and technologies aligned with macro trends in food security, sustainable processes, health, and personalized nutrition. The Company strategically invests in R&D across the entire nutrition value chain by leveraging its access to innovative processes and product optimization. The R&D team is also engaged in BioSolutions initiatives which are a key part of ADM’s commitment to utilize its value chain to reduce its carbon footprint, redesign core products with sustainable alternatives, and explore new markets.\nThe Company is dedicated to transforming aspirations into solutions and brand innovation. The integration of interdisciplinary experts in biology, chemistry, physiology, nutrition, agronomy, and product development provides a competitive edge.\nR&D teams are closely connected to customers and the global markets. Targeted product development leverages innovative ingredients and ADM’s existing portfolio across different segments. R&D innovation centers across three continents enable the rapid transformation of ideas into products. An external network of collaborators, including customers, key opinion leaders, start-ups, and academia amplifies the Company’s scientific excellence.\nThe scope and application of the Company’s technical capabilities reinforce its commitment to global health and sustainable products. High-throughput screening and characterization facilities strengthen ADM’s extensive ingredient database. Formulation platforms enable rapid upscaling or downscaling for cost-effective innovation. Resources dedicated to functional ingredient characterization enhance the Company’s capacity to deliver on the science behind each product.\nADM’s R&D strategy prioritizes fulfilling customer expectations and supporting the Company’s growth. The Company’s future strategy aims to deliver world-class solutions more efficiently and sustainably, and to capitalize on ADM’s full potential. \nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\nThe Company knows that the health of our natural resources is critical to our future, and that its commitment to sustainable practices will result in a stronger ADM and a better world. ADM is committed to being a force for change in developing innovative, sustainable solutions in agriculture, food and nutrition, industrial and consumer products, energy, and packaging materials while pursuing ways to continually improve the Company’s efforts in both protecting the environment and enhancing environmental sustainability. The United Nations Development Programme created the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) blueprint as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. ADM focuses its efforts toward goals that align with its business objectives and allow the Company to make the greatest contribution towards the achievement of the SDGs, specifically Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and Economic Growth, Climate Action, and Life On Land.\n10\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\nGovernance \nThe Sustainability and Technology Committee of the Board actively oversees the Company’s objectives, goals, strategies, and activities relating to sustainability. The Sustainability Committee also oversees the Company’s compliance with sustainability laws and regulations, assesses performance relating to industry benchmarks, and assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the Company’s operations as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect ADM’s reputation. The Company’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Senior Vice President of Global Operations, and Chief Technology Officer regularly attend committee meetings as management representatives. The Executive Council of ADM, the Company’s highest strategic and operational body, provides close supervision of the Company’s ESG efforts and in-depth review of sustainability issues. Furthermore, regional sustainability teams, along with the corporate sustainability team, support the Chief Sustainability Officer to drive sustainability efforts in the Company’s facilities and supply chains around the world. ADM’s sustainability efforts are also supported by functional expertise throughout the Company such as in Operations and Utilities, Supply Chain and Procurement, Agricultural Services and Oilseeds, and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS).\nStrategy \nThe Company aims to mitigate climate change and protect biodiversity through renewable product and process innovations, supply chain efforts including a commitment to no-deforestation or native vegetation conversion and regenerative agriculture, and a strategic approach to operational excellence with a focus on enhancing the efficiency of ADM’s production plants throughout its global operations.\nADM believes sustainability is critical to its future growth strategy. ADM’s strategic plan of sustainable growth leverages the trends and technologies in sustainability to help the Company grow and create value for its stakeholders. Agricultural Services and Oilseeds is focused on traceability of sourcing and differentiation and working with growers on low carbon agricultural practices and products. Carbohydrate Solutions is focused on decarbonization efforts that increasingly position the segment to offer low-carbon intensity feedstocks for biosolutions and biomaterials, including fuel solutions, to replace petroleum-based products. Nutrition is working with suppliers and customers to identify nature positive solutions that can reduce environmental impact in supply chains. The growth of these projects and businesses will be integral to supporting the objective of helping the planet limit total global warming to the 1.5°C threshold indicated by the United Nations. Additionally, the Company has incorporated the achievement of GHG emission goals and water reuse goals to executive performance measurement to reflect the strategic importance of ESG to its business. \nMoreover, ADM has a large industrial footprint and believes it is important to reduce GHG emissions related to its business activities and the entire agricultural supply chain. The Company continues to use internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce its GHG emissions globally to meet its continued commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nADM's Strive 35 plan is an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% from a 2019 baseline, reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% from a 2021 baseline, increase use of low-carbon energy sources to 25% of total energy used, reduce absolute water withdrawal by 10%, and achieve a 90% landfill diversion rate. To support the Company’s Strive 35 environmental goals, ADM developed a feasibility study with a leading engineering professional services firm that provides the technology pathway for absolute reduction of GHG emissions by 2035. The Company has also committed to develop a global strategy focused on improving community well-being in priority watersheds, including water-stressed areas, by the end of 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 14.7% and reduced Scope 3 GHG emissions by 7.7%. The Company reduced absolute water withdrawal by 4.2%. The Company realized no increase in low carbon energy usage and achieved 86.1% of its waste diverted from landfill. \nThe Company anticipates spending between $400 million and $500 million on capital projects to achieve the Strive 35 targets. Through December 31, 2024, ADM has spent $297 million on projects in support of these goals since inception, of which $139 million was spent in 2024.\n11\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\nThe Company believes that protection of natural resources, habitats, and biodiversity are important to life and to the Company’s business. ADM is committed to eliminating deforestation from all of the Company’s supply chains in 2025. In 2023, after a strategic investigation of the impact of conversion of native habitats in its key supply chains, the Company announced its commitment to eliminate conversion of native habitats in high risk areas in South America for direct suppliers of all commodities in 2025 and indirect suppliers by 2027, with a 2025 cutoff date (a date after which conversion of primary native vegetation renders a given area or production unit non-compliant) for both direct and indirect suppliers. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company spent $64 million specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and in light of requirements of various environmental agencies.\nThere have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. \nADM’s corporate social investment program, ADM Cares, aligns the Company’s corporate giving with its business strategies and sustainability objectives. Through the program, ADM works to sustain and strengthen its commitment to communities where ADM colleagues work, live, and operate by directing funding to initiatives and organizations driving meaningful social, economic, and environmental progress. The ADM Cares team evaluates potential projects submitted for funding to ensure they meet eligibility criteria, such as initiatives that support food security, health and well-being, and sustainability around the world. \nAdditional Sustainability Disclosures\nProgram updates, scenario analysis, and metrics and targets are available in ADM’s Corporate Sustainability Report which can be accessed through its website at http://www.adm.com.\nReferences to the Company’s website address in this report are provided as a convenience, and information contained on, or available through, the website is not incorporated by reference.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \nThis MD&A generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II. Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed on November 18, 2024.\nCompany Overview\nArcher-Daniels-Midland Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"ADM\") unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life. The Company is an essential global agricultural supply chain manager and processor, providing food security by connecting local needs with global capabilities. ADM is a premier human and animal nutrition provider, offering one of the industry's broadest portfolios of ingredients and solutions from nature. The Company is a trailblazer in health and well-being, with an industry-leading range of products for consumers looking for new ways to live healthier lives. ADM is a cutting-edge innovator, guiding the way to a future of new consumer and industrial solutions. ADM is a leader in sustainability, scaling across entire value chains to help decarbonize the multiple industries it serves. Around the globe, the Company's innovation and expertise are meeting critical needs while nourishing quality of life and supporting a healthier planet.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into three reportable segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17. Segment and Geographic Information for further details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments. \nStrategy\nThe Company’s strategic transformation is focused on three strategic pillars: Productivity, Innovation, and Culture.\nThe Productivity pillar includes (1) partnering across various global teams including procurement, supply chain, operations, and commercial to optimize costs and improve both production volumes and demand fulfillment across the enterprise; (2) implementation of improved standardized business processes and aggressive management of selling, general, and administrative expenses and Corporate costs; (3) portfolio simplification to improve operational performance; and (4) increased use of technology, data analytics, and automation at production facilities, in offices, and with customers to improve efficiencies and customer service.\nThe Innovation pillar includes expansions and investments in (1) the modernization and digitization of our operations network; (2) sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of products, solutions, capabilities, and commitments to serve both customer needs and farmer resilience; and (3) growth initiatives, including organic growth with additional capacity to meet growing market demand and strategic objectives.\nThe Culture pillar focuses on building capabilities and enabling collaboration, teamwork, and agility from process standardization and digitalization, and bringing new perspectives and expertise to the Company’s decision-making. \nADM plans to support the three pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding digital capabilities and investing further in research and development.\n32\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSustainability\nSustainability is a key driver in ADM’s expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible, plant-derived products. Consumers today increasingly expect their food and drink to come from sustainable ingredients, produced by companies that share their values, and ADM is continually finding new ways to meet those needs through its portfolio actions.\nSignificant Portfolio Actions\nThe Company’s significant portfolio actions and announcements during 2024 include the following acquisitions:\n•\nRevela Foods, a Wisconsin-based developer and manufacturer of innovative dairy flavor ingredients and solutions; \n•\nFDL, a UK-based leading developer and producer of premium flavor and functional ingredient systems;\n•\nPT Trouw Nutrition Indonesia, a leading provider of functional and nutritional solutions for livestock farming in Indonesia; and \n•\nTotally Natural Solutions Ltd., a UK-based hops flavoring producer.\nSee Part II. Item 8. Note 3. Acquisitions of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information. \n \nInternal and Government Investigation \nThe Company has historically disclosed in the footnotes to its financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with the Company’s previously disclosed internal investigation regarding certain accounting practices and procedures with respect to its Nutrition reporting segment, including as related to certain intersegment sales (the “Investigation”) the Company identified certain intersegment sales that occurred between the Company’s Nutrition reporting segment and the Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. The Company corrected those errors in its fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K, along with subsequently identified errors that the Company corrected in an amendment to its Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “FY2023 10-K/A”), and its Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2024, all of which were filed on November 18, 2024, to restate the segment information disclosure included in those filings. \nAs previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) relating to, among other things, intersegment sales between the Company’s Nutrition reporting segment and the Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments.\n \nThe Company is continuing to cooperate with the SEC and DOJ investigations and is unable to predict the outcome of these investigations. \nMaterial Weakness \nIn connection with the Investigation, the Company identified a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to its accounting practices and procedures for segment disclosures. For more information, see “Controls and Procedures” in Part II, Item 9A herein.\nOperating Performance Indicators\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks inherent to an agricultural-based commodity business. These risks are further described in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. As a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. Therefore, margins per volume or metric ton generally are meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses.\nThe Company's Nutrition segment also utilizes agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold. As a result, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins. Therefore margin rates generally are meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses. \n33\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company has consolidated subsidiaries in approximately 80 countries. For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except for certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar. \nThe Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), margins, segment operating profit, total segment operating profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, return on invested capital, adjusted economic value added, and operating cash flows before working capital. Some of these metrics are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. For more information, see the “\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n” section below.\nThe Company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, global production of similar and competitive crops, and geopolitical developments. Due to the unpredictable nature of these and other factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nMarket Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 \nThe Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results, including those discussed below related to 2024. \nIn the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, following two years of very favorable market conditions, several headwinds in the agriculture cycle, including fewer market dislocations and high cost inflation, led to more normalized results throughout the entire value chain. Ag Services benefited from improved river conditions and an excellent crop in North America, which improved export volumes, while South America Origination margins were negatively impacted by take or pay contracts with railroads. Global Trade market conditions were driven by solid trading and continued structured trade finance opportunities. Crushing saw depressed vegetable oil demand and lower prices primarily driven by increased market supply, imports of used cooking oil, uncertainty with the Producer Tax Credit policy change, and the delay of the European Union's Deforestation Regulation requirements. In Refined Products and Other, North America margins were pressured by an increase in the supply of low carbon intensity feedstock and limited forward sales opportunities caused by the uncertainty around Producers Tax Credit policy transition. \nIn the Carbohydrate Solutions segment, demand for starches and sweeteners remained solid with margins remaining steady across the entire portfolio. Strong export demand for ethanol helped offset higher industry production to minimize the imbalance between supply and demand. \nIn the Nutrition segment, demand was mixed in a few food and beverage product categories driven by shifts in consumer discretionary spend and preferences. Human Nutrition was impacted by inflation, which drove lower demand and decreased volumes for alternative proteins in some regions. Demand started to recover in the food, beverage, and dietary supplement categories. In Animal Nutrition, a soft amino acids market driven by price weakness in North America was partially offset by an improved market in EMEA. The global feed market saw some modest improvement with continued price weakness of main feed ration commodities, while key livestock prices remained steady. The feed additives market was impacted by volatility on vitamins due to supply disruptions, however overall it modestly improved, following the improvement in the feed sector.\n34\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nProcessed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in metric tons):\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\nChange\nOilseeds\n35,719\n \n34,899 \n820 \nCorn\n18,541\n \n18,067 \n474 \n  Total\n54,260\n \n52,966 \n1,294 \nThe Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. The overall increase in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to improved crush capacity in North America, driven by the Company's new facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota, and in EMEA in 2024 compared to lower crush rates in the previous year due to inclement weather, unplanned downtime, and reduced capacity due to the Russian-Ukraine war. The overall increase in corn processed volumes was related to increased plant reliability in 2024 compared to lower volumes in the previous year driven by unplanned downtime at the Decatur, Illinois plant. \nFederal Blenders’ and Producers’ Credits\nBiodiesel tax incentives have been provided through various U.S. statutes. The Blenders' Tax Credit (BTC) is the primary regulation, applicable to qualifying biodiesel. The BTC has lapsed and been reinstated numerous times over the last decade. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended the BTC through December 31, 2024 and established a new Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC) effective January 1, 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a benefit of $316 million related to the BTC. The Company estimates a significant decrease in the CFPC available in the year ending December 31, 2025 compared with the BTC claimed during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nAnalysis of Results of Operations\n \nEarnings before income taxes decreased 47% or $2.0 billion, to $2.3 billion, primarily driven by lower pricing and execution margins, as well as a $461 million impairment charge related to the Company’s investment in Wilmar, partially offset by increased sales volumes.\nTotal segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) in 2024 decreased 28% or $1.7 billion, to $4.2 billion, driven by lower results in the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment and the Nutrition segment. Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) in 2024 excluded asset impairment, restructuring and net settlement contingencies of $490 million, and a gain on the sale of certain assets of $10 million. Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) in 2023 excluded asset impairment, restructuring, and net settlement contingencies of $361 million, and a gain on the sale of certain assets of $17 million. \nTotal segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) is reconciled to earnings before income taxes, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in the \"\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\" section below.\n35\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, were as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\nChange\nAg Services and Oilseeds\n \n \n \nAg Services\n$\n44,083\n \n$\n47,420 \n$\n(3,337)\nCrushing\n11,836\n \n14,020 \n(2,184)\nRefined Products and Other\n10,597\n \n11,986 \n(1,389)\nTotal Ag Services and Oilseeds\n66,516\n \n73,426 \n(6,910)\nCarbohydrate Solutions\n \n \n \nStarches and Sweeteners\n8,587\n \n9,885 \n(1,298)\nVantage Corn Processors\n2,647\n \n2,989 \n(342)\nTotal Carbohydrate Solutions\n11,234\n \n12,874 \n(1,640)\nNutrition\nHuman Nutrition\n3,944\n \n3,634 \n310 \nAnimal Nutrition\n3,405\n \n3,577 \n(172)\nTotal Nutrition\n7,349\n \n7,211 \n138 \nTotal Segment Revenues\n85,099\n \n93,511 \n(8,412)\nOther Business\n431\n \n424 \n7 \nTotal Revenues\n$\n85,530\n \n$\n93,935 \n$\n(8,405)\nRevenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in market prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit. \nRevenues decreased $8.4 billion to $85.5 billion driven by lower sales prices ($16.0 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($7.6 billion). Lower sales prices of soybeans, corn, meal, oils, wheat and alcohol, were partially offset by higher sales volumes of soybeans, corn, oils, wheat, alcohol, and flavors. Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues decreased 9% to $66.5 billion driven by lower sales prices ($13.5 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($6.6 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 13% to $11.2 billion driven by lower sales prices ($2.3 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($612 million). Nutrition revenues increased 2% to $7.3 billion driven by higher sales volumes ($386 million), partially offset by lower sales prices ($248 million).\nCost of products sold decreased $6.7 billion to $79.8 billion driven primarily by lower average commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses increased $288 million primarily driven by increased salaries and benefits driven by salary increases, higher depreciation expenses, increased legal, professional, and other fees, increased maintenance expenses due to work performed at Ag Services and Oilseeds facilities in Decatur, Illinois and the Company's new facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota, among others, partially offset by decreases in energy costs, particularly driven by lower energy pricing in North America and EMEA. \nForeign currency translation impacts decreased revenues by $335 million and cost of goods sold by $290 million, decreasing gross profit by $45 million. \n36\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGross profit decreased $1.7 billion or 23%, to $5.8 billion driven by lower margins in Ag Services, which decreased by $300 million to $1.2 billion, Crushing, which decreased $518 million to $991 million, Refined Products and Other, which decreased $709 million to $554 million, Starches and Sweeteners, which decreased by $112 million to $1.4 billion, and Human Nutrition, which decreased by $77 million to $941 million, partially offset by higher margins in Animal Nutrition, which increased $62 million to $509 million. \nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased 7% to $3.7 billion driven by higher legal and financing fees, higher salary and benefit costs, and increased amortization of intangibles, driven by the Company’s investment in computer software and intangibles acquired in business combinations, partially offset by decreased incentive compensation reflecting lower Company performance and reduced provisions for bad debt.\nAsset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $203 million to $545 million. Charges in 2024 included a $461 million impairment related to the Company's Wilmar equity investment, $43 million of impairments related to customer lists and discontinued trademarks in the Animal Nutrition subsegment, $4 million of reportable segment specific restructuring charges and $23 million of restructuring in Corporate. Charges in 2023 consisted of $137 million of impairments related to goodwill in the Animal Nutrition reporting unit, $108 million of impairments related to property, plant, and equipment and an equity method investment, $64 million of impairments related to customer list and discontinued Animal Nutrition trademarks, $27 million of reportable segment specific restructuring charges, and $6 million of restructuring in Corporate.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $70 million to $621 million due primarily to higher earnings from the Company’s investments in Almidones Mexicanos S.A., Wilmar, Skyland Grain, LLC, and Hungrana Ltd., partially offset by lower earnings from the Company’s investment in Olenex Sarl and SoyVen. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had sold its interest in Skyland Grain, LLC. \nInterest and investment income increased $63 million to $562 million driven by lower investment valuation losses in 2024 of $16 million, a decrease of $60 million when compared to the prior year, and higher interest income within Ag Services and Oilseeds ($30 million, compared to the prior year of $0), driven by bond investments within South America, partially offset by lower net interest income (decrease of $36 million) for ADM Investor Services due to lower customer balances.\nInterest expense increased $59 million to $706 million driven by increased use of the Company’s commercial paper borrowing programs.\n \nOther income - net of $251 million increased $75 million. Current year income included third party insurance recoveries of $133 million, foreign exchange gains of $46 million, and net gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business of $16 million. Prior year income included net gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business of $38 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million, net foreign exchange gains of $85 million, and net other income.\nIncome taxes of $476 million decreased $352 million. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was 21.1% compared to 19.3% for 2023\n.\n The increase in the effective rate was driven primarily by the impairment of the Company’s investment in Wilmar and changes in the Company's geographic mix of earnings.\n37\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSegment Operating Profit\nSegment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\nChange\nSegment Operating Profit\nAg Services and Oilseeds\nAg Services\n$\n715\n \n$\n1,168 \n$\n(453)\nCrushing\n844\n \n1,290 \n(446)\nRefined Products and Other\n552\n \n1,306 \n(754)\nWilmar\n336\n \n303 \n33 \nTotal Ag Services and Oilseeds\n$\n2,447\n \n$\n4,067 \n$\n(1,620)\nCarbohydrate Solutions\nStarches and Sweeteners\n$\n1,343\n \n$\n1,329 \n$\n14 \nVantage Corn Processors\n33\n \n46 \n(13)\nTotal Carbohydrate Solutions\n$\n1,376\n \n$\n1,375 \n$\n1 \nNutrition\nHuman Nutrition\n$\n327\n \n$\n417 \n$\n(90)\nAnimal Nutrition\n59\n \n10 \n49 \nTotal Nutrition\n$\n386\n \n$\n427 \n$\n(41)\nIn the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, segment operating profit decreased 40%. The Ag Services subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023. South America Origination margins decreased driven by lower origination volumes and margin compression due to slow farmer selling and higher industry rail freight take or pay agreements. North America grain exports were not competitive with South America, leading to weak exports and costs from a carry market contributed to slow farmer selling, limiting trade opportunities in the first half of the year. Execution in destination marketing as well as effective risk management continued to deliver strong Global Trade results in 2024, though lower than 2023. The Crushing subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023, particularly in North America. Increased industry capacity pressured Crushing margins and an increased supply of competing low carbon intensity feedstocks, and the European Union's Deforestation Regulation delay negatively affected margins. For 2024, there were approximately $20 million of net positive mark-to-market timing effects, compared to approximately $185 million of net positive impacts in 2023. The Crushing subsegment current year operating results also included $76 million of insurance proceeds for the partial settlement of the Decatur East and West insurance claims related to incidents in 2023. The Refined Products and Other (RPO) subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023 as increased pre-treatment capacity at renewable diesel facilities, higher imports of used cooking oil, aggressive competition among food suppliers to serve customer demand, and biofuel policy uncertainty negatively impacted margins. There were net negative timing impact of approximately $430 million year-over-year.\nIn the Carbohydrate Solutions segment, segment operating profit was flat compared to the prior year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment operating profit was higher year-over-year driven by improved cost position on higher utilization rates, higher joint-venture earnings, and $84 million of insurance proceeds for the partial settlement of the Decatur East and Decatur West insurance claims related to an incident that occurred in 2023. Strong margins and volumes in North America were offset by weaker domestic ethanol margins, co-product values, and margins in EMEA. The Vantage Corn Processors subsegment results decreased year-over-year driven by lower margins, due to higher industry production and inventory levels, partially offset by higher volumes driven by increased exports.\n38\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn the Nutrition segment, segment operating profit decreased 9%. Human Nutrition results were lower than the prior year. Specialty Ingredients was impacted by unplanned downtime at Decatur East, higher costs of goods sold associated with the termination of an unfavorable supply agreement, and a normalizing texturants market negatively impacted margins, partially offset by\n \n$71 million of insurance proceeds for the partial settlement of the 2023 Decatur East incident insurance claims and changes in inventory adjustments compared to the prior year. In Health and Wellness, lower profits were driven by inventory reserve adjustments due primarily to changes in customer demand fulfillment, non-recurring benefits in the prior year, and softer margins within Vitamins, offset by stronger growth in biotics and botanicals. The prior year was impacted by a revaluation loss of $19 million related to an investment in precision fermentation. Flavors results were higher than the prior year driven by current year acquisitions, and a prior year $45 million negative impact primarily related to the deconsolidation and write-down of a joint venture. Animal Nutrition results were higher compared to the prior year, as amino acids market recovery, cost optimization efforts and lower input costs bolstered margins.\nOther Business and Corporate Results\nOther Business contribution of operating profit decreased 34% from $375 million to $247 million. Lower net interest income from reduced trading activity levels drove decreased earnings in ADM Investor Services. Captive insurance results decreased, driven by higher claim settlements, which included partial settlements of $231 million for the Decatur East and West insurance claims, of which $133 million was from reinsurers during the fourth quarter.\nCorporate results were as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\nChange\nInterest expense - net\n (1)\n$\n(482)\n$\n(431)\n$\n(51)\nUnallocated corporate costs\n (2)\n(1,205)\n(1,144)\n(61)\nExpenses related to acquisitions\n(7)\n(7)\n— \nGain on debt conversion option\n—\n \n6 \n(6)\nRestructuring charges\n (3)\n(23)\n(6)\n(17)\nOther expense - net \n(4)\n(4)\n(24)\n20 \nTotal Corporate\n$\n(1,721)\n$\n(1,606)\n$\n(115)\n(1)\nInterest expense-net increased $51 million driven by increased borrowings and higher interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowing programs and increased interest expense relating to uncertain tax positions. \n(2)\nUnallocated corporate costs increased $61 million driven by increases in legal and professional fees and securitization fees, offset by decreased incentive compensation driven by lower Company performance. \n(3)\nRestructuring charges increased $17 million driven by $10 million relating to foreign restructuring charges.\n(4)\nOther expense in the current year included railroad maintenance expenses of $64 million and net valuation losses of approximately $16 million in the Company’s ADM Ventures portfolio. Other income in the current year also included foreign exchange gains of $78 million and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million. Other expense in the prior year included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million and foreign exchange gains, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million and investment revaluation losses of $57 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses certain “Non-GAAP” financial measures as defined by the SEC. These are measures of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, GAAP reported measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this section.\nThe Company uses adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. \n39\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAdjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the effects on net earnings of specified items as more fully described in the reconciliation tables. Adjusted diluted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items as more fully described in the reconciliation tables. \nEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest on borrowings, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted to exclude the impact of specified items as more fully described in the reconciliation tables. \nTotal segment operating profit is defined as ADM’s consolidated earnings before income taxes, adjusted for Other Business, Corporate, and specified items as more fully described in the reconciliation tables. \nManagement believes that adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company’s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. \nAdjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to net earnings, diluted EPS, and earnings before income taxes, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP. \nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net earnings (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to adjusted net earnings (a non-GAAP measure) and diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS (a non-GAAP measure) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nPer share\nIn millions\nPer share\nAverage number of shares outstanding - diluted\n493\n \n542 \nNet earnings and reported EPS (fully diluted)\n$\n1,800\n \n$\n3.65\n \n$\n3,483 \n$\n6.43 \nAdjustments:\nGains on sale of assets (net of tax of $3 million in 2024 and $5 million in 2023) \n(1)\n(8)\n(0.02)\n(12)\n(0.03)\nAsset impairment, restructuring, and net settlement contingencies (net of tax of $1 million in 2024 and $57 million in 2023) \n(1)\n512\n \n1.04\n \n310 \n0.57 \nExpenses related to acquisitions (net of tax of $2 million in 2024 and $1 million in 2023) \n(1)\n5\n \n0.01\n \n6 \n0.01 \nGain on debt conversion option (net of tax of $0)\n (1)\n—\n \n—\n \n(6)\n(0.01)\nCertain discrete tax adjustments \n(2)\n30\n \n0.06\n \n4 \n0.01 \nAdjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS\n$\n2,339\n \n$\n4.74\n \n$\n3,785 \n$\n6.98 \n(1)\n Tax effected using the U.S. and applicable tax rates.\n(2) \nIncludes impact of changes in tax law, valuation allowances, and the Company's indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings.

Based on the Company’s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $4.5 billion, the Company has asserted these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has total available liquidity of $9.7 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and unused lines of credit. The Company believes that cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and unused lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its ongoing liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.8 billion, $4.5 billion, and $3.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by lower earnings in the current year and changes in net working capital. Changes in net working capital were driven by changes in segregated investments, changes in inventory, changes in trade payables and changes in payables to brokerage customers. Segregated investments increased $693 million in the current year compared to an increase of $194 million in the prior year, driven by higher interest rates. Inventories decreased $162 million in the current year reflecting lower commodity pricing, offset by increased volumes of on-hand inventories compared to a decrease of $2.9 billion in the prior-year, reflecting lower commodity pricing. Trade payables decreased $719 million in the current year compared to a decrease of $1.5 billion in the prior year, reflecting lower commodity pricing. Brokerage payables decreased $78 million in the current year compared to a decrease of $2.1 billion in the prior year which was driven by decreased trading activity in the Company’s futures commission and brokerage business. \nInvesting Cash Flows\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 included additions to property, plant and equipment of $1.6 billion, business acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $927 million, and purchases of short-term investments, primarily driven by purchases within South America, of $308 million. \nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 included additions to property, plant and equipment of $1.5 billion.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.5 billion, $4.6 billion, and $2.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 included net borrowings on short-term credit agreements of $1.8 billion.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was driven by net borrowings of short-term credit agreements of $390 million, corporate bond repayments of $963 million, which consisted of the €600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750% Notes due 2023 and $300 million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon exchangeable bonds due 2023, partially offset by proceeds from debt of $501 million. \nCash paid for share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $2.3 billion, $2.7 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively. \nDividends paid for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $985 million, $977 million, and $899 million, respectively. \n42\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Ratios\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.4 to 1 and 1.6 to 1, respectively. Included in working capital was $7.0 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt of $7.6 billion and shareholders’ equity of $22.2 billion in 2024 and the sum of long-term debt of $8.3 billion and shareholders’ equity of $24.1 billion in 2023) was 25% at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nThe Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt of $1.9 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of $674 million, and long-term debt of $7.6 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of $611 million and short-term marketable securities of $246 million in 2024, and the sum of short-term debt of $105 million, current maturities of long-term debt of $1 million, and long-term debt of $8.3 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2023) to capital (the sum of net debt of $9.3 billion and shareholders’ equity of $22.2 billion in 2024 and the sum of net debt of $7.0 billion and shareholders' equity of $24.1 billion in 2023) was 30% and 22% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nCredit Ratings \nAs of December 31, 2024, the three major credit rating agencies maintained the Company’s credit ratings at investment grade levels with a negative outlook.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transaction agreement with Merrill Lynch International, an affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc., to repurchase $1.0 billion of ADM common stock as part of ADM’s existing share repurchase program to repurchase up to 200 million shares through December 31, 2024. \nOn March 28, 2024, the Company received an interim delivery of 8,880,986 shares at an average share price of $60.596, or $538 million in aggregate. On April 15, 2024, the Company received a final delivery of 7,325,733 shares at an average share price of $63.045, or $462 million in aggregate, as final settlement of the ASR transaction. \nOn December 11, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved a second extension of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2029 and the repurchase of up to an additional 100,000,000 shares under the extended program. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 115 million shares remaining that may be repurchased under its stock repurchase program until December 31, 2029.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Program \nThe Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. The Programs provide the Company with up to $2.8 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expand the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Part II. Item 8. Note 19 Sale of Accounts Receivable for more information and disclosures on the Programs). As of December 31, 2024, the Company utilized $2.0 billion of its facility under the Programs. \nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn 2025, the Company expects capital expenditures of $1.5 billion and additional cash outlays of approximately $1.0 billion in dividends and up to $155 million in share repurchases, subject to other strategic uses of capital and the evolution of operating cash flows and the working capital position throughout the year.\nThe Company’s purchase obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $12.4 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in obligations to energy commitments. \n43\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of $11.8 billion within the next twelve months. The Company’s other material cash requirements within the next 12 months include current maturities of long-term debt of $674 million, interest payments of $325 million, operating lease payments of $377 million, transition tax liability of $61 million, and pension, other postretirement, and defined contribution plan contributions of $114 million. \nThe Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations and other material cash requirements beyond the next twelve months of $15.9 billion. \nThe Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Company’s accounting estimates are considered critical, as these estimates are important to the depiction of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on ADM’s financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting estimates. Following are the accounting estimates management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives\nDescription: Certain of the Company’s inventory, inventory-related payables, and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 are valued at estimated fair values, including $7.0 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $0.8 billion of commodity derivative assets, $0.8 billion of commodity derivative liabilities, and $0.7 billion of inventory-related payables. Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward purchase and sales contracts for agricultural commodities. Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.\nJudgments and Uncertainties: Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. The Company’s inventory, inventory-related payables, and commodity derivative fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $3.5 billion of assets and $0.5 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price. For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Part II. Item 8. Note 4 Fair Value Measurements. \nSensitivity of Estimate to Change: Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods could differ materially.\nIncome Taxes\nDescription: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards which prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. Changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur. \n44\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nJudgments and Uncertainties: ADM calculates its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax attributes available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company uses judgment in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change: While ADM considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. The Company recognizes a tax position in its Consolidated Financial Statements when it is determined to be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \nBusiness Combinations\nDescription: The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended. The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill. The Company accounts for any redeemable non-controlling interest in temporary equity - redeemable non-controlling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings. \nJudgments and Uncertainties: Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. \nSensitivity of Estimate to Change: During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. \nGoodwill Impairment\nDescription: Goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. At December 31, 2024, the Company had goodwill of $4.5 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or more frequently whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. The Company has seven reporting units with goodwill identified at one level below the operating segment using the criteria in ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). Two reporting units do not have any recorded goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment for two reporting units and using a quantitative assessment for five reporting units. See Part II. Item 8. Note 9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information.\n45\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nJudgments and Uncertainties: The Company has the option to first qualitatively assess factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company elects not to use this option, or it is determined that qualitative factors alone are not sufficient to conclude whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or it is determined from the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, the fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value, when using a discounted cash flow analysis, of each reporting unit require management to make assumptions including, but not limited to, future expected cash flows of the reporting unit utilizing appropriate revenue growth, EBITDA margins, and discount rates. A decline in the actual cash flows of a reporting unit in future periods, as compared to the projected cash flows used in the discounted cash flow analysis, could result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value. Further, a change in the discount rate, as a result of a change in economic conditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying values of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change: Per the results of the impairment testing within the Ag Services and Oilseeds (AS&O) reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Ag Services, Crushing, and RPO reporting units evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment was in excess of 128%, 191% and 209% of its carrying value, respectively, and no impairment was recorded for any of the AS&O reporting units. Per the results of the impairment testing within the Nutrition reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Animal Nutrition and Human Nutrition reporting units evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment was in excess of 7% and 32% of its carrying value, respectively, and no impairment was recorded for either of the Nutrition reporting units. \nThe Company used a combination of the income and market approaches when performing the quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The Company weighted the income approach with a probability weight of 75%, as it is based on the future business plans and growth estimates for the Company’s Animal Nutrition business and thus considers short-term and long-term cash flow expectations for the business. The market approach was weighted less heavily at 25%, as it represents an estimate of fair value based on market guideline companies for which future growth expectations are not precisely known. \nThe income approach is predicated upon the value of the estimated future cash flows that a business will generate going forward. The Company used the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method under the income approach for the analysis of Animal Nutrition. \nThe market approach assumes that companies operating in the same industry will share similar characteristics and that values will correlate to those characteristics. Therefore, under the market approach, a comparison of the reporting unit to similar companies whose financial information is publicly available may provide a reasonable basis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The two forms of the market approach most commonly applied are the Guideline Public Company (GPC) method and the Guideline Merged and Acquired Company (GMAC) method. The Company utilized the GPC method to estimate the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit under the market approach. The GMAC method was also considered, but ultimately was not relied upon due to the lack of recent transactions that were directly comparable. In the selection of the appropriate market multiples, the Company considered the performance of the business, the size, risks, opportunities, and a comparison of the margins and growth of the Animal Nutrition business compared to the guideline public companies. The estimated fair value calculated by the GPC method was within 5% of the estimated fair value calculated by the income approach.\nThe Company performed a sensitivity analysis for the significant assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing analysis for the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The sensitivities were calculated in isolation using the income approach and keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivities for revenue growth and EBITDA growth do not consider the offsetting impact of a lower discount rate assumption to reflect the reduced risk in estimated future cash flow growth used under the income approach or the related impacts on pricing multiples used under the market approach.\n46\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2024, goodwill allocated to the Animal Nutrition reporting unit totaled $887 million. For Animal Nutrition impairment testing, certain hypotheticals would have the following results: \n–\nA hypothetical increase to the discount rate of approximately 100 basis points would result in a goodwill impairment of approximately $68 million; \n–\nA hypothetical decrease to forecasted EBITDA margins of approximately 50 basis points would result in goodwill impairment of approximately $5 million; and\n–\nA hypothetical decrease in the expected annual revenue growth rate over the entire forecast of approximately 250 basis points would result in a goodwill impairment of approximately $69 million.\nInvestments in Affiliates\nDescription: The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its 22.5% investment in Wilmar. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee. However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements. \nJudgments and Uncertainties: The Company has evaluated its investments in affiliates as of December 31, 2024 to be appropriately stated at carrying values. The Company also periodically compares the book value of its investment in Wilmar against its market value as determined through quoted market prices, and evaluates any potential other-than-temporary impairment. The Company’s investment in Wilmar had a carrying value of $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, and a market value of $3.2 billion based on the quoted Singapore Exchange market price, converted to U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate, at December 31, 2024. The Company evaluated several factors in its determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment had occurred. This included consideration of the short duration of the carrying value being above Wilmar's stock price, the recent performance of Wilmar’s stock price as quoted on the Singapore Exchange, latest consensus analyst forecasts, Wilmar’s long history of earnings and dividends and the Company’s continued representation on Wilmar’s Board. The Company considers its investment in Wilmar a significant and strategic relationship and has the intent and ability to retain its investment in Wilmar for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Based on the evaluation of the factors above, the Company does not consider the investment to be other-than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2024. \nSensitivity of Estimate to Change: The performance of impairment tests involves the use of estimates and assumptions, which may change period to period. If the Company management used different assumptions in the evaluation of its equity method investments, including its investment in Wilmar, the Company may conclude that the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. \nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee “\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n” within Note 1.
