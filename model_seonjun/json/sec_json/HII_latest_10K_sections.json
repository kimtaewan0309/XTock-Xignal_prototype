  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nHistory and Organization\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (\"HII\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") is a global, all-domain defense partner, building and delivering the world's most powerful, survivable naval ships and technologies that safeguard America’s seas, sky, land, space, and cyber. For more than a century, our Ingalls Shipbuilding segment (\"Ingalls\") in Mississippi and Newport News Shipbuilding segment (\"Newport News\") in Virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other U.S. naval shipbuilder, making us America's largest shipbuilder. Our Mission Technologies segment develops integrated technology solutions and products that enable today's connected, all domain force. Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, we employ over 44,000 people domestically and internationally.\nWe conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government, primarily the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"). As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or partner, we participate in many high-priority U.S. defense programs. Ingalls includes our non-nuclear ship design, construction, repair, and maintenance businesses. Newport News includes all of our nuclear ship design, construction, overhaul, refueling, and repair and maintenance businesses. Our Mission Technologies segment provides a wide range of services and products, including command, control, computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and operations; the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to battlefield decisions; defense and offensive cyberspace strategies and electronic warfare; uncrewed autonomous systems; live, virtual, and constructive training solutions; fleet sustainment; and critical nuclear operations.\nIngalls\n \nThrough our Ingalls segment, we design and construct non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, including amphibious assault ships, expeditionary warfare ships, surface combatants, and national security cutters (\"NSC\"). We are the sole builder of amphibious assault ships and one of two builders of surface combatants for the U.S. Navy. We are the sole builder of large multi-mission NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. Our Ingalls segment is located in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 800 acres along the Pascagoula River.\nAmphibious Assault Ships\n \nWe construct amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, which include U.S. Navy large deck amphibious assault ships (\"LHA\") and amphibious transport dock ships (\"LPD\"), respectively. The LHA is a key component of the Department of the Navy's requirement for Expeditionary Strike Groups/Amphibious Readiness Groups, and design, construction, and modernization of LHAs are core to our Ingalls operations. In 2007, we were awarded the construction contract for USS \nAmerica \n(LHA 6), the first in a class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized Marine assault platform. We are currently constructing \nBougainville \n(LHA 8) and \nFallujah\n (LHA 9). In 2023, we were awarded a long-lead-time material contract for \nHelmand Province\n (LHA 10), and in 2024, we were awarded a contract modification for the detail design and construction of \nHelmand Province\n (LHA 10).\n \nThe LPD program is a long-running production program of expeditionary warfare ships. We delivered USS \nFort Lauderdale\n (LPD 28) in 2022 and \nRichard M. McCool Jr\n. (LPD 29) in 2024. We are currently constructing  \nHarrisburg\n (LPD 30), and \nPittsburgh \n(LPD 31). In 2023, we were awarded a contract to construct \nPhiladelphia \n(LPD 32). In 2024, we were awarded a multi-ship procurement contract for the construction of \nTravis Manion \n(LPD 33), LPD 34 (unnamed), and LPD 35 (unnamed).\nSurface Combatants\n \nWe are a design agent for, and one of only two companies that constructs, \nArleigh Burke \nclass guided missile destroyers (\"DDG\"), a class of surface combatant. We have delivered 35 \nArleigh Burke \nclass (DDG 51) destroyers to the U.S. Navy, including USS \nJack H. Lucas\n (DDG 125) in 2023, USS \nLenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee \n(DDG 123) in 2022, and USS \nFrank E. Petersen Jr.\n (DDG 121) in 2021. In 2018, we were awarded a multi-year contract for construction of six \nArleigh Burke\n class (DDG 51) destroyers and, in 2020,a contract to construct an additional \n1\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nArleigh Burke\n class (DDG 51) destroyer. In 2023, we were awarded a multi-year contract for construction of six more \nArleigh Burke\n class (DDG 51) destroyers, as well as the first option ship, for a total of seven ships. We are currently constructing \nTed Stevens\n (DDG 128), \nJeremiah Denton\n (DDG 129), \nGeorge M. Neal\n (DDG 131), \nSam Nunn\n (DDG 133), and \nThad Cochran\n (DDG 135). \n \nNational Security Cutters\n \nThe U.S. Coast Guard's recapitalization program is replacing aging and operationally expansive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline. The flagship of this program is the \nLegend \nclass NSC, a multi-mission platform we designed and continue to build. In 2018, we were awarded long-lead-time material and construction contracts for \nCalhoun\n (NSC 10), which was delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 2023.\nNewport News\nThe core business of our Newport News segment is designing and constructing nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines, and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Our Newport News shipyard is located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the James River, which adjoins the Chesapeake Bay.\n \nDesign, Construction, Refueling and Complex Overhaul, and Inactivation of Aircraft Carriers\nEngineering, design, and construction of U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carriers (\"CVN\") are core to Newport News operations. Aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the U.S. Navy's fleet, with a displacement of over 90,000 tons. Newport News has designed and built more than 31 aircraft carriers for the U.S. Navy since 1933, including all ten \nNimitz \nclass (CVN 68) aircraft carriers currently in active service, as well as the first ship of the next generation \nGerald R. Ford\n class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers.\n \nWe delivered USS \nGerald R. Ford\n (CVN 78), the first aircraft carrier of the \nGerald R. Ford\n class to the U.S. Navy in 2017. Beginning in 2009, we received contract awards totaling $8.8 billion for construction preparation, detail design, and construction of the second \nGerald R. Ford \nclass (CVN 78) aircraft carrier, \nJohn F. Kennedy\n (CVN 79). In addition, we have received contract awards valued at $15.3 billion for detail design and construction of the \nGerald R. Ford \nclass (CVN 78) aircraft carriers, \nEnterprise \n(CVN 80) and \nDoris Miller\n (CVN 81).\n \nWe continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul (\"RCOH\"). Each RCOH takes nearly four years to complete, with the work accounting for approximately 35% of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carrier's 50 year service life. RCOH services include propulsion work (refueling of reactors; propulsion plant modernization; and propulsion plant repairs), restoration of service life (dry docking, tank, and void maintenance; hull, shafting, propellers, and rudders; launch and recovery system; piping repairs; and component refurbishment), and modernization (electrical systems; aviation support systems; warfare; interoperability; and environmental compliance). We provide ongoing maintenance services for the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet through both RCOH and fleet support services worldwide. \nUSS \nGeorge Washington\n (CVN 73) was redelivered to the U.S. Navy in 2023 after completion of its RCOH, and we are currently performing the RCOH of USS \nJohn C. Stennis\n (CVN 74). We believe our current position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our RCOH performance on the first seven \nNimitz \nclass (CVN 68) carriers, our highly trained workforce, the capital-intensive nature of RCOH work, and high barriers to entry due to required nuclear expertise position us well for RCOH contract awards on the remaining \nNimitz \nclass (CVN 68) carriers, as well as future RCOH work on \nGerald R. Ford \nclass (CVN 78) aircraft carriers.\nAircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years, and we believe the ten \nNimitz \nclass (CVN 68) carriers we delivered that are currently in active service, as well as \nGerald R. Ford \nclass (CVN 78) aircraft carriers, present significant opportunities for inactivation contracts as they reach the end of their lifespans. We believe we are well positioned to be the U.S. Navy's shipyard of choice for these contract awards.\nDesign and Construction of Nuclear-Powered Submarines\n \nWe are one of only two companies in the United States currently capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. Newport News has delivered 64 submarines to the U.S. Navy since 1960, comprised \n2\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nof 50 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Our nuclear submarine program, located at our Newport News shipyard, includes construction, engineering, design, research, and integrated planning. \nVirginia Class (SSN 774) Submarines\nWe have a teaming agreement with Electric Boat Corporation (\"Electric Boat\"), a division of General Dynamics Corporation (\"General Dynamics\"), to build \nVirginia \nclass (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines. Under the teaming arrangement, we build the stern, habitability and machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room, control room, and pressure hull structure. Work on the reactor plant and the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery of the submarines to the U.S. Navy alternates between Electric Boat and us. \nThe four submarines of the first block, six submarines of the second block, and eight submarines of the third block of \nVirginia\n class (SSN 774) submarines have been delivered. In 2014, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten \nVirginia\n class (SSN 774) submarines, which contemplated production of two submarines per year. The first submarine of the Block IV contract was delivered in 2020, and five more submarines have been delivered through 2024. The remaining four boats of the Block IV contract are in the final assembly and test phases of construction. \nIn 2019, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fifth block of nine \nVirginia\n class (SSN 774) submarines, and, in 2021, an option for a 10th submarine was exercised, continuing the two submarines per year production rate. Ten of the Block V boats are in manufacturing and outfitting stages of construction.\nIn 2023, the team was awarded a contract modification for advance procurement for long lead-time material in support of two additional Block V boats, bringing the total Block V boats to 12. In 2023 and 2024, the team received contract awards for advance procurement of long-lead-time material in support of all ten Block VI boats.\nColumbia Class (SSBN 826) Submarines\nNewport News is participating in the design and construction of the \nColumbia \nclass (SSBN 826) nuclear ballistic missile submarines (\"SSBN\") as a replacement for the current aging \nOhio \nclass submarines, which were first introduced into service in 1981. The \nColumbia \nclass (SSBN 826) program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines. We perform design work as a subcontractor to Electric Boat, and we have entered into a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build modules for the entire \nColumbia \nclass (SSBN 826) submarine program that leverages our \nVirginia \nclass (SSN 774) experience. Contract award for the first two \nColumbia\n class submarines (SSBN 826 and SSBN 827) and construction start of the first \nColumbia\n class (SSBN 826) submarine occurred in late 2020. In 2023, we were awarded a contract modification for long-lead-time material and advance construction in support of five additional \nColumbia \nclass (SSBN 826) boats, also referred to as Build II of the class.\nNaval Nuclear Support Services\nNewport News provides additional services to and in support of the U.S. Navy, ranging from services supporting the Navy's carrier and submarine fleets to maintenance services at U.S. Navy training facilities. Fleet support services include design, construction, maintenance, and disposal activities for in-service U.S. Navy nuclear ships worldwide through mobile and in-house capabilities. We also provide maintenance services on nuclear reactor prototypes, such as those at the Kenneth A. Kesselring Site, a research and development facility in New York that supports the U.S. Navy, which were completed in 2024.\n \nMission Technologies \nOur Mission Technologies segment is organized into four groups, All-Domain Operations, Warfare Systems, Global Security, and Uncrewed Systems, and specializes in a wide range of services and products across our capabilities. Capabilities including command, control, computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and operations; the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to battlefield decisions; defense and offensive cyberspace strategies and electronic warfare; uncrewed autonomous systems; live, virtual, and constructive training solutions; fleet sustainment; and critical nuclear operations.\n3\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nCommand, control, computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (\"C5ISR\")\nDesigns, develops, integrates, and manages the sensors, systems, and other assets necessary to support integrated C5ISR operations and accelerated decision-making. These business activities provide data fusion and mission management capabilities for the DoD, the combatant commands, and the intelligence community.  \nCyber and electronic warfare (\"CEW&S\")\nWorks within our nation’s intelligence and cyber operations communities to defend U.S. interests in cyberspace and anticipate emerging threats. Our capabilities in cybersecurity, network architecture, reverse engineering, software, and hardware development uniquely enable our ability to support sensitive missions for the U.S. military and federal agency partners. We also develop, test, and integrate leading-edge AI and machine learning algorithms to optimize and accelerate the nation’s mission-critical systems and platforms. \nLive, virtual, and constructive solutions (\"LVC\")\nA trusted partner to our military customers, our capabilities include designing, developing, and operating the largest live, virtual, and constructive enterprise that prepares warfighters for cross-domain battle. Our training connects live environments with virtual platforms and simulated (constructive) threats to prepare trainees through integrated, real-world scenarios before they are in harm’s way. This is a modern and distributed approach to U.S. military training\n.\n \nFleet Sustainment\nProvides comprehensive life-cycle sustainment to the U.S. Navy fleet and other DoD and commercial maritime customers. Services include maintenance, modernization, and repair on all ship classes; naval architecture, marine engineering, and design; integrated logistics support; technical documentation development; warehousing, asset management, and material readiness; operational and maintenance training development and delivery; software design and development; IT infrastructure support and data delivery and management; and cyber security and information assurance. We also provide undersea vehicle and specialized craft development and prototyping services.\nUncrewed systems\nDevelops advanced uncrewed systems for defense, marine research, and commercial applications. Serving customers in more than 30 countries, we provide design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations, and sustainment of uncrewed systems, including uncrewed underwater vehicles and uncrewed surface vessels\n.\nNuclear and Environmental Services\nNuclear and Environmental Services support the Department of Energy’s (\"DoE\") national security mission through the management and operation of DoE sites, as well as the safe cleanup of legacy waste across the country. Through participation in joint ventures, including Newport News Nuclear BWXT Los Alamos, LLC (\"N3B\"), Mission Support and Test Services, LLC (\"MSTS\"), and Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (\"SRNS\"), we meet customers’ toughest nuclear and environmental challenges. \nCustomers\nOur revenues are primarily derived from the U.S. Government, including the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, the DoD, the DoE, and other federal agencies. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 80%, 81%, and 82%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the U.S. Navy.\nIntellectual Property\nWe develop new technologies that are incorporated into the products and services we provide to our customers. We also develop new manufacturing processes and systems-integration technologies and processes that we use to produce our products and to provide services to our customers. In addition to owning intellectual property, we license intellectual property rights to and from other parties. The U.S. Government generally receives non-exclusive \n4\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nlicenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of U.S. Government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our U.S. Government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense. The U.S. Government may use or authorize other parties to use the intellectual property we license to the government. While our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property.\nSeasonality\nNo material portion of our business is seasonal. The timing of our revenue recognition is based on multiple factors, including the timing of contract awards, the incurrence of contract costs, contract cost estimation, and unit deliveries. See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8.\nBacklog\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our total backlog was approximately $48.7 billion and $48.1 billion, respectively. We expect approximately 21% of backlog at December 31, 2024, to be converted into sales in 2025.  \nRaw Materials\n \nWe rely on third parties to provide raw materials. The most significant material we use is steel. Other materials we use in large quantities include paint, aluminum, pipe, electrical cables, electronic components, fittings, custom machine items, and sensors. In connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. For long-term contracts, we generally solicit price quotations for many of our material requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing. While we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source, we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry. We have experienced challenges with access to, and the pricing of, certain raw materials, components, and other supplies due to, in part, labor shortages and inflation. The inability to procure the necessary raw materials, components, and other supplies for our products on a timely and cost-effective basis has negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. We endeavor to mitigate supply chain risk through various measures, such as negotiating long-term agreements with certain raw material suppliers and through price escalation provisions in certain customer contracts. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials.\nRegulatory Matters\nWe operate in heavily regulated markets and must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts, as well as legal and regulatory requirements relating to, among others, cybersecurity, environmental protection, and our nuclear operations. These requirements increase our contract performance costs and compliance costs and risks. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further discussion regarding risks related to regulatory matters.\nGovernment Contracting\nWe are overseen and audited by the U.S. Government and its agencies, including the U.S. Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), and the Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\"). These agencies evaluate our contract performance, cost structures, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, which could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory, treble, or other damages. Certain U.S. Government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges.\nU.S. Government agencies also evaluate the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to U.S. Government requirements. Our business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems, purchasing systems, government property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management accounting systems. The U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems.\n5\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nThe U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little or no prior notice, for convenience or for default based upon performance. In the event of termination of a contract for convenience, a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on incurred costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program. A termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities, including excess re-procurement costs, and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts. \nOur contracts with the U.S. Government sometimes result in Requests for Equitable Adjustments (\"REAs\"), which represent requests for the U.S. Government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms, including pricing, delivery schedule, technical requirements, or other affected terms, due to changes to the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption for which the U.S. Government is responsible. We submit and negotiate REAs in the ordinary course of business, and large REAs are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and RCOH activities. REAs can result in claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 in cases in which we cannot reach agreement with the U.S. Government.\n \nU.S. Government regulations determine contractor costs that are allowable and therefore recoverable from the government, and certain costs are not allowable and therefore not recoverable. The U.S. Government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs, including overhead, are allocated to government contracts. Costs we incur that are not allowable under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (the “FAR”) or U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”) or that are otherwise determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract are not recoverable or must be refunded if already reimbursed.\n \nOur business, including contracts with U.S. Government agencies and subcontracts with other prime contractors, is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the FAR, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (\"DFARS\"), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act, CAS, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values, contract modifications or terminations, penalties, fines, repayments, compensatory, treble, or other damages, or suspension or debarment. We are also subject to evolving cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations, which increase our costs and compliance risks and may affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to damage claims, substantial fines, and other penalties. See Note 6: Revenue under Item 8 and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding our contracts.\nNuclear\nOur nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, or shut down our operations, depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance. In addition, new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures.\nSubject to certain requirements and limitations, our contracts with the U.S. Navy and the DoE generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations. For our commercial nuclear operations, we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation, and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding nuclear regulatory matters.\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Substantial fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and several \"strict liability\" for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties.\n6\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nWe accrue estimated costs to perform environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future, in amounts we can reasonably estimate, to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities, or at sites where we are named a Potentially Responsible Party (\"PRP\") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") or similarly designated by another environmental agency. Uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation, determination of legally responsible parties, and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations make future environmental remediation costs difficult to estimate and can cause our estimated remediation costs to change.\nWe believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business. We could be affected by new or evolving environmental laws, regulations, or policies. We have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental legal requirements, but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations. We do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and Note 15: Commitments and Contingencies under Item 8 for further information regarding environmental matters.\nCompetitive Environment\nIn our business of designing, building, overhauling, and repairing military ships, we primarily compete with General Dynamics and, in the case of certain non-nuclear shipbuilding programs, smaller shipyards. The smaller shipyards sometimes team with large defense contractors. Intense competition related to programs, resources, funding, and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our shipbuilding business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general. It is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another party, become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding long-term contracts, enables companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries.\nWe believe we are well-positioned in our shipbuilding markets. Because we are the only company currently capable of building, refueling, and inactivating the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we believe we are positioned well to be awarded future contracts to perform such activities. Even so, the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities. If a U.S. Government shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our market position would likely be significantly and adversely affected.\nWhile we have competed with another large defense contractor to build large deck amphibious ships, we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, including LHAs and LPDs. We are also the sole builder of NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. We are one of only two companies currently capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy, and we are party to long-term teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both \nVirginia\n class (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines and \nColumbia\n class (SSBN 826) ballistic missile submarines. We are one of only two companies that builds the U.S. Navy's current fleet of \nArleigh Burke \nclass (DDG 51) destroyers and are positioned well to be awarded future contracts for surface combatant ships. \nOur Mission Technologies segment competes domestically and internationally against large aerospace and defense (\"A&D\") companies, primarily L3 Harris, Amentum, ManTech, Leidos, and, increasingly, small businesses serving the intelligence community. To a lesser extent, our lines of business compete on certain contracts with major prime A&D contractors, including Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, RTX Corporation, and Boeing.\nKey competitive factors in the Mission Technologies segment include technology capabilities; innovative cyber advances and artificial intelligence; the ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; the ability to meet delivery schedules; and cost effectiveness. Our success depends on investments in our people, technologies, and products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. To remain competitive, we must be able to identify emerging technology trends and consistently provide superior service, while understanding customer priorities and maintaining customer relationships.\n7\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nOur success depends upon our ability to develop, market, produce, and deliver our products and services at costs and on schedules consistent with our customers' expectations, as well as our ability to provide the workforce, technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe recognize that our employees are our most important resources and serve as the foundation for our ability to achieve financial and strategic objectives. Our employees are critical to driving operational execution, meeting customer expectations, delivering strong financial performance, advancing innovation, and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program. Our leaders believe each employee contributes to our success.\n \nWe have over 44,000 employees. We are the largest industrial employer in Virginia and the largest private employer in Mississippi. We employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades, with approximately 7,000 engineers and designers and approximately 4,600 employees with advanced degrees. Our workforce contains many third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation employees, and approximately 1,525 employees with more than 40 years of continuous service. Employees in our shipbuilding segments with more than 40 years of continuous service achieve the honor of “Master Shipbuilder.” As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,260 Master Shipbuilders at Newport News and 213 at Ingalls. We also employ more than 6,500 veterans across the enterprise.\nIn addition, over 1,400 apprentices are enrolled in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs at our two shipbuilding segments. From nuclear pipe welders to senior executives, we employ approximately 4,100 apprentice school alumni at Newport News and Ingalls.\nApproximately 45% of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements. Newport News has \nthree\n collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, which expire in February 2027, December 2027 and April 2029. Ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, all of which expire in March 2026. Approximately 15 Mission Technologies employees in Klamath Falls, Oregon are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in June 2025. \nWe have not experienced a work stoppage in more than 25 years at Newport News and more than 17 years at Ingalls. We are committed to working effectively with our existing unions and believe our relationship with our represented employees is satisfactory. \nThe success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop a skilled workforce of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in the markets in which we compete for labor, we have developed key workforce development, recruitment, and retention strategies and objectives that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies and objectives form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies, and initiatives:\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits\n - \nOur compensation programs are designed to ensure we have the ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve our objectives.\n•\nWe provide employee base wages and salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location.\n•\nWe utilize nationally recognized surveys and outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our employee and executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry.  \n•\nThe structure of our executive compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance, and we align our executive long-term equity compensation metrics with long-term shareholder interests.\n•\nEmployees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, 401(k) plans, and life and disability/accident insurance coverage. We also offer a variety of benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including: annual leave/paid time off; paid holidays, flexible work arrangements/schedules; telemedicine; parental leave; and a wellness program that includes physical, mental, and financial wellness components. We also fund the operation of Family Health Centers near our two shipyards, which provide a full range of medical, lab, pharmacy, dental, physical therapy, and vision services.\n8\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nRecruitment, Training, and Workforce Development\n - \nWe are focused on attracting, retaining, and developing a skilled workforce, and in 2024, we hired approximately 10,000 new employees. To help us meet the increasing demand for talent, we maintain multiple talent pipelines and continue to review and update our talent management strategies to meet operational needs. \nOne of the key components of our approach to workforce development is to “grow our own.” We operate two apprentice schools, one at Ingalls and one at Newport News. The Newport News Apprentice School was founded in 1919, and the Ingalls Apprentice School was founded in 1952. The two apprentice schools combined have graduated over 15,500 graduates since their inceptions. The schools are nationally renowned and are critical to training both our craft/trades and technical workforce, as well as developing the future leaders of our company. The Ingalls Apprentice School has partnered with the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College to permit their apprentices to earn credits toward an associate’s degree. The Newport News Apprentice School has partnered with two community colleges, as well as Old Dominion University, to enable apprentices to earn a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Modeling & Simulation. \nIn addition to operating our own apprentice schools, we maintain partnerships with colleges and universities, military bases for transitioning veterans, and regional community colleges to enable us to recruit and hire engineering, IT, and other technical talent. Working closely with state and local government leaders, we also have facilitated local, regional, and state-wide workforce development and education initiatives that include pre-K programs, high school trades programs/talent development labs, pre-hire trades/technical community college programs, interns/co-ops with colleges and universities, adult trades programs, veterans and military spouses training programs, and unemployed/underemployed training programs.\nWe view our workforce development process as critical to our success and have developed a robust and effective succession planning process that ensures continuity in our leadership ranks. Since our founding in 2011, we have followed our succession plans over 80% of the time when replacing a vacancy in an existing vice president position, and we have filled approximately 80% of newly created vice president positions with internal hires. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding our human capital resources.\nEnvironmental, Health & Safety (“EH&S”) - \nThe health, safety, and well-being of our employees, together with protection of the environment in the communities in which we operate, is one of our core values and rooted in our culture across the enterprise. We prioritize, manage, and carefully track safety performance and integrate sound environmental, safety, and health practices to make a meaningful difference in every facet of our operations, particularly at our shipbuilding segments and at DoE sites on which Mission Technologies segment employees work. \n \nSafety goals are included in operational metrics under the Newport News and Ingalls compensation programs. We also use a wide variety of training courses, pre-job “Take Five” crew talks, medical surveillance programs, and employee involvement to focus our workforce on EH&S. At Newport News and Ingalls, a key component of our EH&S program is the utilization of health and safety teams, which are comprised of production and maintenance employees and front-line managers whose goal is to educate, engage, and empower our workforce toward a culture that strives to reduce injury, illness, and environmental impacts. We employ programs focused on identifying, reporting, and abating near misses and other programs that aim to recognize, evaluate, and control hazards, and track multiple metrics related to occupational injuries as one of several methods to monitor our safety performance. \nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a website at the following address: hii.com.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K along with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\"\nBusiness Environment\nWe continue to see uncertainty in the economy, our industry, and our company. Our customers, suppliers and subcontractors continue to face challenges, and our results for the year were adversely affected by significant challenges relating to labor availability, our supply chain, and inflation, among other challenges. We cannot predict how long these challenges will continue, whether these challenges will change over time, or whether our actions to address these challenges will be successful. \nU.S. Political and Economic Environment\n – The November 2024 elections, which resulted in Republican control of the executive and legislative branches, has resulted in a range of policy changes both domestically and internationally as Republicans seek to reorient U.S. priorities. The new Administration has employed, and is expected to continue to employ, executive actions and other methods, including regulations and policy proposals that impact trade, tax, immigration, energy policies, and other areas. \nThe debt ceiling is expected to continue to be an area of considerable debate. High debt levels may impose fiscal constraints on many policy objectives, complicating efforts to deliver on promises made during the elections. \nDomestically, we expect that national debt levels, inflationary pressures, gross domestic product growth, among other considerations, could impact U.S. budgets and priorities, including with respect to discretionary spending. While monthly inflation rates have declined since peaking at 9.1% in June of 2022, rising military personnel and operations and maintenance costs continue to pressure the Pentagon’s investment portfolio buying power. If above-\n33\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \naverage inflationary conditions continue over the long-term, additional resources may be required to address contract and labor cost growth. \nGlobal supply chain and labor markets continue to experience high levels of disruption, causing significant materials and parts shortages, including raw material, microelectronics and commodity shortages, as well as delivery delays, labor shortages, and price increases. The labor market continues to present significant challenges for our Company, our industry, and the supply chain. Our ability to increase throughput and meet production schedules is directly impacted by labor availability and performance. We monitor labor market conditions and trends and work to mitigate the effects of labor challenges through a variety of measures. Challenges in the labor market are addressed through targeted talent acquisition, partnerships with community colleges, apprentice school sourcing and recruiting, workforce succession planning, and initiatives to retain current employees. Labor shortages and retention also are impacting our supply chain, resulting in longer lead times for materials, parts, and other supplies. Our supply chain has been impacted further by delivery delays, raw material shortages and price increases caused by continued inflationary pressures.\nThe shipbuilding defense industry is unique in many ways. It is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive. The U.S. Navy, a large single customer with many needs and requirements, dominates the industry's customer base and is served by a fragile supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers. The DoD continues to adjust its procurement practices and streamline acquisition organizations and processes in an ongoing effort to reduce costs, gain efficiencies, and enhance program management and control. Additionally, the U.S. Navy must compete with other national priorities, including other defense activities, non-defense discretionary spending, and entitlement programs, for a share of federal budget funding. While the impact to our business resulting from these developments remains uncertain, they could have a material impact on current programs, as well as new business opportunities with the DoD. \nDefense Spending Environment\n – On March 11, 2024, the Biden Administration proposed a Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget request of $849.8 billion for the DoD, consistent with the discretionary funding cap for defense approved by Congress under the Financial Responsibility Act (“FRA”) of 2023. Additionally, the FRA included a sequestration mechanism to incentivize Congress to enact regular, full-year appropriations legislation instead of relying on continuing resolutions (\"CR\"). Although the Federal government is operating under a CR through March 14, 2025, sequestration would not be enforced until April 30, 2025 and would be reversed upon the enactment of full-year appropriations. The emergency national security supplemental funding legislation enacted during fiscal year 2025 is not subject to the FRA budget caps. \nThe House and Senate reached a compromise agreement on the National Defense Authorization Act (\"NDAA\") for fiscal year 2025 in December 2024. Overall, the fiscal year 2025 NDAA authorizes $883.7 billion in national security spending, including $849.9 billion for the Pentagon, consistent with the spending caps directed in the FRA. The compromise legislation supports our shipbuilding priorities with a total authorization of $32.7 billion for shipbuilding programs, including procurement authorization of the \nTravis Manion \n(LPD 33) Flight II amphibious ship, one \nVirginia\n class (SSN 774) submarine, three \nArleigh Burke\n class (DDG 51) destroyers and the RCOH of USS \nHarry S. Truman\n (CVN 75). Additionally, the fiscal year 2025 NDAA supports the amphibious warship bundle contract signed in 2024 by authorizing advanced procurement funding for LPD 34 (unnamed), LPD 35 (unnamed), and \nHelmand Province\n (LHA 10). \nBoth House and Senate appropriations bills have passed out of committee, and the House defense appropriations bill has been approved by the full House. The House defense appropriations bill funds the Defense Department within the spending caps in the 2023 debt limit deal and supports the President’s budget request by funding one \nVirginia\n class (SSN 774) submarine, two \nArleigh Burke\n class (DDG 51) destroyers, one LPD Flight II amphibious ship, and one CVN RCOH. The Senate Appropriations Committee added approximately $21 billion in emergency funding not subject to the FRA caps and included fiscal year 2025 funding for three \nArleigh Burke\n class (DDG 51) destroyers, one \nVirginia\n class (SSN 774) submarine, one LPD Flight II amphibious ship, one CVN RCOH, one FFG-62 frigate, and advanced procurement funding for an additional \nArleigh Burke\n class destroyer in fiscal year 2026. \nAlthough a new fiscal year began on October 1, 2024, annual appropriations to fund the federal government for fiscal year 2025 have not been enacted. To provide Congress additional time to reach agreements on funding levels for federal agencies, a continuing resolution was enacted extending funding through December 20, 2024, at fiscal year 2024 levels. Congress passed a second CR in December 2024 that extended federal funding through March 14, 2025.\n34\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nWhile the DoD is normally prohibited from starting new programs or increasing funding on existing programs under a CR, the current CR includes anomalies that will allow the DoD to deviate from typical restrictions and obligate funding to support procurement of the \nVirginia\n class and \nColumbia\n class submarine programs. A $5.7 billion emergency appropriations anomaly supports fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 \nVirginia\n class submarines as well as workforce wages and shipyard investments. This funding does not count against the FRA fiscal year 2025 funding cap. \nWe cannot predict the outcome of the fiscal year 2025 budget process or whether additional short-term funding will be required in the event annual appropriations measures are not finalized by the expiration date of the current CR. \nGlobal Geopolitical Environment\n – The global geopolitical environment continues to be impacted by uncertainty, heightened tensions, and instability, all of which drive the increasing need for defense offerings, including those provided by our company. Global geopolitical relationships continue to evolve. The U.S. and its allies face a global security environment that is impacted by threats from state and non-state actors, including major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns, and political instability. \nThe ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the associated sanctions have impacted the global economy, caused heightened cyber and other security risks, exacerbated supply chain challenges, resulted in higher energy costs, and further impacted inflationary pressures. In addition, tensions with China, along with hostilities in the Middle East, continued conflicts globally, and changes in international trade policies have impacted, and could continue to impact, the global market for defense products, services, and solutions.\nProgram Descriptions\n \nFor convenience, a brief description of certain programs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is included in the Glossary of Programs.\nCONTRACTS\nWe generate most of our revenues from long-term U.S. Government contracts for the production of goods and services. Government contracts typically include the following cost elements: direct material, labor and subcontracting costs, and certain indirect costs, including allowable general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, costs billed to contracts with the U.S. Government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the FAR and CAS regulations. Examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the FAR and CAS regulations include certain legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, interest expense, organizational costs, including certain merger and acquisition costs, and advertising costs.\nWe monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions, as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations. In addition, the DCAA routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to U.S. Government contracts.\nOur contracts typically fall into one of four categories: firm fixed-price, fixed-price incentive, cost-type, and time and materials. See Note 6: Revenue in Item 8.\n•\nFirm Fixed-Price Contracts \n- A firm fixed-price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is predetermined by bid or negotiation and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor. \n•\nFixed-Price Incentive Contracts\n - Fixed-price incentive contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor's allowable costs, but are subject to a cost-share limit that affects profitability. Fixed-price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share limit is reached.\n•\nCost-Type Contracts \n- Cost-type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor's allowable costs plus a fee that represents profit. Cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use its reasonable efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation. \n35\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \n•\nTime and Materials \n- Time and materials contracts specify a fixed hourly billing rate for each direct labor hour expended and reimbursement for allowable material costs and expenses.\nContract Fees \n- Negotiated contract fee structures include: fixed fee amounts, cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under- or over-cost target performance, respectively, positive award fees, and negative penalty arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements, percentage-of-completion of the contract, the achievement of performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.\nAward Fees \n- Certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality, and technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria. We consider award fees to be variable consideration and generally include these fees in the transaction price using a most likely amount approach. Award fees are limited to the extent of funding allotted by the customer and available for performance and those amounts for which a significant reversal of revenue is not probable.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. Due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies, it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions. While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. We consider our policies relating to the following matters to involve our most critical accounting policies and estimates:\n•\nRevenue recognition;\n•\nRetirement related benefit plans; and\n•\nWorkers' compensation.\nRevenue Recognition\nMost of our revenues are derived from long-term contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the U.S. Government, which are generally accounted for by recognizing revenues over time using a cost-to-cost measure of progress. In estimating contract costs, we utilize a profit-booking rate based upon performance expectations that incorporate a number of assumptions and estimates regarding risks related to technical requirements, feasibility, schedule, and contract costs. Management performs periodic reviews of the contracts to evaluate the underlying risks, which may increase the profit-booking rate as we are able to mitigate and retire such risks. For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, see Note 6: Revenue in Item 8.\nRetirement Related Benefit Plans\nWe recognize, on a plan-by-plan basis, the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet, with corresponding adjustments to after-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss and deferred tax assets or liabilities. The funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. See Note 16: Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8.\nWe calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both CAS and U.S. GAAP Financial Accounting Standards (\"FAS\"). The calculations under CAS and FAS require significant judgment. CAS prescribes the determination, allocation, and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on U.S. Government contracts through the pricing of products and services. FAS prescribes the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income, as well as the liability, for financial reporting purposes. The CAS requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from FAS. As a result, while both CAS and FAS use \n36\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nassumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs.\nWe recover our CAS costs through the pricing of products and services on U.S. Government contracts, so that the CAS cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues. In order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with FAS, we record the difference between our FAS expense and CAS cost (“FAS/CAS Adjustment”) as operating income within segment operating income and non-operating retirement benefit (expense).\nThe minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), which is primarily based on the year's expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities. Effective January 1, 2011, we were subject to the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \"PPA\"), which amended ERISA. Under the PPA and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling 15-year period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year. The PPA also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. In funding our plans, we consider various factors, including the minimum funding requirements, the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences, minimum CAS funding requirements, and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan.\nEffective January 1, 2021, we adopted the Safe Harbor methodology for determining CAS pension costs. As a result, the interest rates used to calculate pension liabilities under CAS are consistent with those used in the determination of minimum funding requirements under ERISA.\nPension funding requirements for plan sponsors under ERISA are subject to pension relief in the form of higher interest rate assumptions introduced by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act and subsequently extended by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Using these minimum funding interest rates for the purposes of determining pension costs under CAS reduces volatility in CAS costs year-over-year and provides more predictable costs for our customers, while better aligning reimbursements of pension costs under our contracts with our required pension plan contributions under ERISA.\nDue to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between FAS and CAS, our FAS pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under the PPA or the amounts we recover from the U.S. Government under CAS.\nAssumption\ns - We account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under FAS. The measurements of obligations, costs, assets, and liabilities require significant judgment. We annually review our assumptions, which are set at each year end and generally not changed during the following year unless a major plan event occurs, such as an amendment, curtailment, or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement. The key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\nDiscount Rate \n- The assumed discount rate under FAS is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense, and represents the hypothetical rate at which plan benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date. Consequently, the discount rate can be volatile from year to year. The discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate. Benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan but also on the underlying participant demographics, including current age and assumed mortality. We use only bonds that are denominated in U.S. Dollars, are rated Aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, have a minimum outstanding issue of $50 million as of the measurement date, and are not convertible or index-linked. \nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return \n- The expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense, based on such factors as historical returns, targeted asset allocations, investment policy, duration, expected future long-term performance of individual asset classes, interest rates, inflation, portfolio volatility, investment management and administrative fees, and risk management strategies. Historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns. While studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance, the rate of return assumption is based more on long-term prospective views to avoid short-term market influences. Unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to re-\n37\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nmeasurement during the year, the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.\nMortality\n - Mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense, and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity. We periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant.\nDifferences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status. Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss. This unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10% of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or plan assets. The amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants. In 2024, the actual return on assets was approximately 7.7%, which was less than the expected return assumption of 8.00%. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by 70 and 44 basis points, respectively. The differences in asset returns resulted in an actuarial loss of $24 million, and the differences in discount rates resulted in an actuarial gain of $500 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAn increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pension expense and obligations:\n($ in millions)\nIncrease (Decrease) in 2025 Expense\nIncrease (Decrease) in December 31, 2024 Obligations\n25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n$\n3 \n$\n163 \n25 basis point increase in discount rate\n— \n(156)\n25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets\n17 \n25 basis point increase in expected return on assets\n(17)\nAssuming an 8.00% expected return on assets assumption, a $50 million pension plan contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately $2 million, depending on the timing of the contribution. \nSensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted.\nCAS Cost\n - In addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs, CAS also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods. While the ultimate liability for such costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. The key drivers of CAS pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate CAS reimbursement for each of our plans. A plan’s CAS pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the CAS requirements.\nOther FAS and CAS Pension Considerations -\n A key driver of the difference between FAS expense and CAS cost (and consequently the FAS/CAS Adjustment) is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements. Under FAS, our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10% corridor are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants. Under CAS Harmonization, the amortization period is 10 years for actuarial gains and losses. Both FAS and CAS use a \"market-related value\" of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. Under CAS, actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years, subject to certain limitations. For FAS, we do not use this smoothing method, and instead use fair value in determining our FAS expense. Accordingly, FAS expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than CAS. \nAdditionally, CAS cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under CAS. If a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS cost will change accordingly. \nRetirement Plan Assets - \nRetirement plan assets are stated at fair value. Investments in equity securities (common and preferred) are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists. Investments in fixed-income \n38\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nsecurities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders. Investments in hedge funds, real estate investment funds, private partnerships, collective trust funds, and commingled funds are generally valued at their Net Asset Values (\"NAV\") or equivalent, which are based on the current fair values of the fund's underlying assets.\nManagement reviews independently appraised values, audited financial statements, and additional pricing information to evaluate the NAV or its equivalent. \nFor the limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value, additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value. See Note 16: Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss - \nChanges in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments. As disclosed in Note 16: Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8, net pre-tax unrecognized actuarial gains as of December 31, 2024 were $59 million and unrecognized actuarial losses as of December 31, 2023 were $455 million. The increase in actuarial gains in 2024 was primarily driven by higher discount rates used to determine benefit obligations of $500 million and amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses of $5 million, which were offset by lower than expected asset returns of $24 million.\nNet pre-tax unrecognized prior service costs (credits) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $111 million and $125 million, respectively. These net deferred costs (credits) primarily originated from plan amendments, including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements. The change in unrecognized prior service costs (credits) in 2024 resulted from plan amendments and the amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs (credits). \nWorkers' Compensation\n \nOur operations are subject to federal and state workers' compensation laws. We maintain self-insured workers' compensation plans and participate in federally administered second injury workers' compensation funds. We estimate the liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions, which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors. We periodically, and at least annually, update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis. For further information on workers’ compensation, see Environmental, Health & Safety in Item 1 and Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8.\nAccounting Standards Updates\n \nSee Note 3: Accounting Standards Updates in Item 8 for further information.\n39\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nThe following table presents selected financial highlights:\n \nYear Ended December 31\n2024 over 2023\n2023 over 2022\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDollars\nPercent\nDollars\nPercent\nSales and service revenues\n$\n11,535\n \n$\n11,454 \n$\n10,676 \n$\n81 \n1 \n%\n$\n778 \n7 \n%\nCost of product sales and service revenues\n10,085\n \n9,808 \n9,236 \n277 \n3 \n%\n572 \n6 \n%\nIncome from operating investments, net\n49\n \n37 \n48 \n12 \n32 \n%\n(11)\n(23)\n%\nOther income and gains, net\n9\n \n120 \n1 \n(111)\n(93)\n%\n119 \n11,900 \n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n973\n \n1,022 \n924 \n(49)\n(5)\n%\n98 \n11 \n%\nOperating income\n535\n \n781 \n565 \n(246)\n(31)\n%\n216 \n38 \n%\nInterest expense\n(95)\n(95)\n(102)\n— \n— \n%\n7 \n7 \n%\nNon-operating retirement benefit\n179\n \n148 \n276 \n31 \n21 \n%\n(128)\n(46)\n%\nOther, net\n24\n \n19 \n(20)\n5 \n26 \n%\n39 \n195 \n%\nFederal and foreign income taxes\n93\n \n172 \n140 \n(79)\n(46)\n%\n32 \n23 \n%\nNet earnings\n$\n550\n \n$\n681 \n$\n579 \n$\n(131)\n(19)\n%\n$\n102 \n18 \n%\nOperating Performance Assessment and Reporting\nWe manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below, with consideration given to the Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments referred to in this section. Our portfolio of long-term contracts is largely flexibly-priced. Therefore, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts, with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance. Under FAR rules that govern our business with the U.S. Government, most types of costs are allowable, and we do not focus on individual cost groupings, such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses, as much as we do on total contract costs, which are a key factor in determining contract operating income. As a result, in evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues, as well as operating income, including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract financial estimates and the use of the cumulative catch-up method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. This approach is consistent with the long-term life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing our business.\nSales and Service Revenues\nPeriod-to-period revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts. Changes in sales and service\nrevenues are typically expressed in terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume generally refers to\nincreases (or decreases) in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels, delivery rates, or service\nlevels on individual contracts. Volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the\nprofit margin rate for a particular contract.\nSales and service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased $81 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2023, due to higher volumes at Mission Technologies and Ingalls, partially offset by lower volumes at Newport News.\nCost of Sales and Service Revenues\nCost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead. We manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level, which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts. Unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis.\n40\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nRefer to \"Segment Operating Results\" and \"Product and Service Revenues and Cost Analysis\" in this section for details related to cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues.\n \nIncome from Operating Investments, Net\nThe activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments. We therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income.\nRefer to \"Segment Operating Results\" in this section for details related to income from operating investments.\nOther Income and Gains, Net\nOther income and gains, net in 2024 was $9 million, compared to $120 million in 2023. The decrease was due to the sale of a court judgment in 2023 and the settlement of a representations and warranties insurance claim related to the acquisition of Hydroid in 2023, partially offset by the settlement of an insurance claim in 2024.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts, most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts. These costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis, and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2024 decreased $49 million, or 5%, compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower state taxes.\nOperating Income \nWe consider operating income an important measure for evaluating our operating performance, and, consistent with industry practice, we define operating income as revenues less the related costs of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses.\nWe internally manage our operations by reference to \"segment operating income,\" which is defined as operating income before the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes, neither of which affects contract performance. Segment operating income is not a recognized measure under GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use segment operating income in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with GAAP. It is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance. We believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Refer to \"Segment Operating Results\" in this section for details related to segment operating income, as well as activity within each segment.\nThe following table reconciles operating income to segment operating income:\n \nYear Ended December 31\n2024 over 2023\n2023 over 2022\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDollars\nPercent\nDollars\nPercent\nOperating income\n$\n535\n \n$\n781 \n$\n565 \n$\n(246)\n(31)\n%\n$\n216 \n38 \n%\nOperating FAS/CAS Adjustment\n62\n \n72 \n145 \n(10)\n(14)\n%\n(73)\n(50)\n%\nNon-current state income taxes\n(24)\n(11)\n2 \n(13)\n(118)\n%\n(13)\n(650)\n%\nSegment operating income\n$\n573\n \n$\n842 \n$\n712 \n$\n(269)\n(32)\n%\n$\n130 \n18 \n%\n    \n41\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nFAS/CAS Adjustment and Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment\nThe FAS/CAS Adjustment reflects the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with GAAP and the expenses for these items included in segment operating income in accordance with CAS. The Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment excludes the following components of net periodic benefit costs: interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost (credit) and actuarial loss (gain), and settlement and curtailment effects.\nThe components of the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31\n2024 over 2023\n2023 over 2022\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDollars\nPercent\nDollars\nPercent\nFAS benefit (expense)\n$\n64\n \n$\n30 \n$\n86 \n$\n34 \n113 \n%\n$\n(56)\n(65)\n%\nCAS cost\n53\n \n46 \n45 \n7 \n15 \n%\n1 \n2 \n%\nFAS/CAS Adjustment\n117\n \n76 \n131 \n41 \n54 \n%\n(55)\n(42)\n%\nNon-operating retirement benefit\n(179)\n(148)\n(276)\n(31)\n(21)\n%\n128 \n46 \n%\nOperating FAS/CAS Adjustment (expense) benefit\n$\n(62)\n$\n(72)\n$\n(145)\n$\n10 \n14 \n%\n$\n73 \n50 \n%\nThe Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2024 was a net expense of $62 million, compared to a net expense of $72 million in 2023. The favorable change was primarily driven by higher interest rates under FAS.\nWe expect the FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2025 to be a net benefit of approximately $148 million (($100) million FAS and $48 million CAS), primarily driven by higher discount rates under FAS.\nWe expect the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2025 to be a net expense of approximately $43 million ($91 million FAS and $48 million CAS), primarily driven by higher interest rates under FAS. \nThe expected FAS/CAS Adjustment is subject to change during 2025, when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation with updated census data and other items later in the year.\nNon-current State Income Taxes\nNon-current state income taxes include deferred state income taxes, which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities, and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state unrecognized tax benefits in the relevant period. These amounts are recorded within operating income. Current period state income taxes are charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income.\nNon-current state income tax benefit in 2024 was $24 million, compared to non-current state income tax benefit of $11 million in 2023. The favorable change in non-current state income taxes was driven by a decrease in deferred state income tax expense, primarily attributable to the reduction in the blended state income tax rate applied to our deferred tax balances.\nSEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nBasis of Presentation\nOur discussion of business segment performance focuses on sales and service revenues and operating income,\nconsistent with our approach for managing our business.

Changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume generally refers to increases (or decreases) in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels, delivery rates, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the profit margin rate for a particular contract.\nSegment Operating Income\nSegment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment. Excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance, such as the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes. Changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume, as discussed above, or performance. Performance refers to changes in contract profit margin rates. These changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to estimated costs at completion (\"EAC\"), which reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on that contract. Operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an EAC change is recorded. Segment operating income may also be affected by, among other things, contract performance, inflationary pressures on our supply chain, the effects of workforce stoppages and other labor-related shortfalls, the availability of raw materials, the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, resolution of disputed items with the customer, recovery of insurance proceeds, and other discrete events. At the completion of a long-term contract, any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized, such as warranty reserves, could also impact contract earnings. Where such items have occurred and the effects are material, a separate description is provided.\n43\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nNet Cumulative Catch-up Revenue Adjustments\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, gross favorable and unfavorable cumulative catch-up revenue adjustments were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGross favorable adjustments\n$\n287\n \n$\n309 \n$\n325 \nGross unfavorable adjustments\n(413)\n(191)\n(212)\nNet adjustments\n$\n(126)\n$\n118 \n$\n113 \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, net cumulative catch-up revenue adjustments by segment were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIngalls\n$\n14\n \n$\n91 \n$\n109\n \nNewport News\n(154)\n9 \n(13)\nMission Technologies\n14\n \n18 \n17\n \nNet adjustments\n$\n(126)\n$\n118 \n$\n113\n \nIngalls\n \nYear Ended December 31\n2024 over 2023\n2023 over 2022\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDollars\nPercent\nDollars\nPercent\nSales and service revenues\n$\n2,767\n \n$\n2,752 \n$\n2,570 \n$\n15 \n1 \n%\n$\n182 \n7 \n%\nSegment operating income\n211\n \n362 \n292 \n(151)\n(42)\n%\n70 \n24 \n%\nAs a percentage of segment sales\n7.6\n \n%\n13.2 \n%\n11.4 \n%\nSales and Service Revenues\n \nIngalls sales and service revenues, including intersegment sales, increased $15 million, or 1%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher volumes in surface combatants, partially offset by lower volumes in amphibious assault ships and the NSC program.\nSegment Operating Income\nIngalls segment operating income in 2024 was $211 million, compared to segment operating income of $362 million in 2023.

Segment Cost of Product Sales \nProduct sales in 2024 decreased $200 million, or 3%, from 2023, primarily due to lower volumes on aircraft carriers and cumulative catch-up adjustments on the \nVirginia\n class (SSN 774) submarine program at Newport News and lower volumes at Ingalls in amphibious assault ships, partially offset by higher volumes in the \nColumbia\n class (SSBN 826) program at Newport News and higher volumes at Ingalls in surface combatants. \nSegment cost of product sales in 2024 increased $42 million, or 1%, compared to 2023, primarily due to higher volumes at Ingalls in surface combatants and higher volumes in the \nColumbia\n class (SSBN 826) program at Newport News, partially offset by lower volumes on aircraft carriers at Newport News. \nService Revenues and Segment Cost of Service Revenues\nService revenues in 2024 increased $281 million, or 7%, from 2023, primarily as a result of higher volumes at Mission Technologies in CEW&S and C5ISR. \nCost of service revenues in 2024 increased $245 million, or 7%, compared to 2023, consistent with the higher service volumes described above.\nOTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $95 million. \n47\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nNon-Operating Retirement Benefit\nThe non-operating retirement benefit includes the following components of net periodic benefit costs: interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost (credit) and actuarial loss (gain), and settlement and curtailment effects. \nThe non-operating retirement benefit in 2024 was $179 million, compared to $148 million in 2023. The favorable change was primarily driven by higher 2023 returns on plan assets. \nOther, Net\nOther, net income in 2024 was $24 million, compared to other, net income of $19 million in 2023. There were no individually significant drivers for the increase in Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nFederal and Foreign Income Taxes\n \nOur effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 14.5% in 2024, compared to 20.2% in 2023. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2024 was primarily attributable to current and prior period research and development tax credits recorded in 2024.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21% primarily due to research and development tax credits for the current and prior periods.\nIn October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \"OECD\") announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the \"Framework\"), which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy. In December 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax rules, which contemplate a minimum tax rate of 15%. To date, various jurisdictions have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation on these rules, and the OECD continues to release additional guidance. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt the minimum tax directive, certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement the minimum tax directive. Further, the OECD issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules that could delay the impact of the minimum tax directive. We will continue to monitor the implementation of the Framework by the countries in which we operate. We currently do not expect the Framework to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash flows.\nBACKLOG\nTotal backlog as of December 31, 2024, was approximately $48.7 billion. Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer). Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity orders. For contracts having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n \n \nTotal\n \n \nTotal\n($ in millions)\nFunded\nUnfunded\nBacklog\nFunded\nUnfunded\nBacklog\nIngalls\n$\n13,519\n \n$\n2,333\n \n$\n15,852\n \n$\n12,546 \n$\n3,201 \n$\n15,747 \nNewport News\n12,079\n \n14,666\n \n26,745\n \n11,890 \n15,349 \n27,239 \nMission Technologies\n1,824\n \n4,292\n \n6,116\n \n1,545 \n3,590 \n5,135 \nTotal backlog\n$\n27,422\n \n$\n21,291\n \n$\n48,713\n \n$\n25,981 \n$\n22,140 \n$\n48,121 \nWe expect approximately 21% of the $48.7 billion total backlog as of December 31, 2024, to be converted into sales during the year ending December 31, 2025. U.S. Government orders comprised substantially all of the backlog as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n48\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nContract Awards\nThe value of new contract awards during the year ended December 31, 2024, was approximately $12.1 billion, including an award for the maintenance and overhaul of USS \nBoise\n (SSN 764), an award for an advanced planning contract for the RCOH of USS \nHarry S. Truman\n (CVN 75) and an award for construction of USS \nRichard J. Danzig \n(DDG 143).\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe seek to efficiently convert operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses, implementing our business strategy, and maximizing stockholder value. We use various financial measures to inform our capital deployment strategy, including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. We believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance. \nThe following table summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities: \n \nYear Ended December 31\n2024 over 2023\n2023 over 2022\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDollars\nPercent\nDollars\nPercent\nNet earnings\n$\n550\n \n$\n681 \n$\n579 \n$\n(131)\n(19)\n%\n$\n102 \n18 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization of purchased intangible assets\n326\n \n347 \n358 \n(21)\n(6)\n%\n(11)\n(3)\n%\nOther non-cash transactions, net\n10\n \n29 \n15 \n(19)\n(66)\n%\n14 \n93 \n%\nStock-based compensation\n23\n \n34 \n36 \n(11)\n(32)\n%\n(2)\n(6)\n%\nDeferred income taxes\n(122)\n(113)\n2 \n(9)\n(8)\n%\n(115)\n(5,750)\n%\nLoss (gain) on investments in marketable securities\n(22)\n(23)\n25 \n1 \n4 \n%\n(48)\n(192)\n%\nRetiree benefits\n(112)\n(75)\n(127)\n(37)\n(49)\n%\n52 \n41 \n%\nTrade working capital decrease (increase)\n(260)\n90 \n(122)\n(350)\n(389)\n%\n212 \n174 \n%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n393\n \n$\n970 \n$\n766 \n$\n(577)\n(59)\n%\n$\n204 \n27 \n%\n \nWe have historically maintained a capital structure comprised of a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. We expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations, existing borrowing facilities, and/or through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt.\n \nCash Flows\nWe discuss below our significant operating, investing, and financing activities affecting cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, as classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities in 2024 was $393 million, compared to $970 million provided by operating activities in 2023. The unfavorable change in operating cash flow was primarily due to an unfavorable change in trade working capital driven by the timing of billings across programs and lower earnings, partially offset by lower payments for income taxes. \nWe expect cash generated from operations in 2025, in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents, as well as existing borrowing facilities, to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans, meet contractual obligations, and fund capital expenditures for at least the next 12 calendar months beginning January 1, 2025 and beyond such 12-month period based on our current business plans.\n \nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2024 was $348 million, compared to $236 million used in investing activities in 2023. The change in investing cash was primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures and the sale of our \n49\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \ninterest in an unconsolidated ship repair and specialty fabrication joint venture in 2023, partially offset by additional investment in one of our unconsolidated nuclear and environmental joint ventures in 2023. \nFor 2025, we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 1.5% of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 2.0% to 2.5% of annual revenues.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in 2024 was $356 million, compared to $771 million used in financing activities in 2023. The change in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to $1 billion in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and lower repayment of long term debt in the current year, which was partially offset by increased repurchases of common stock. \nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds. Free cash flow is not a measure recognized under GAAP. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net earnings as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and period-to-period performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations. We also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n \nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\nYear Ended December 31\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n393\n \n$\n970 \n$\n766 \nLess capital expenditures:\nCapital expenditure additions\n(367)\n(292)\n(284)\nGrant proceeds for capital expenditures\n14\n \n14 \n12 \nFree cash flow\n$\n40\n \n$\n692 \n$\n494 \nFree cash flow in 2024 decreased $652 million from 2023, primarily due to an unfavorable change in trade working capital driven by the timing of billings across programs, lower earnings, and higher capital expenditures, which was partially offset by lower payments for income taxes.\nRetirement Related Benefit Plan Contributions\nERISA, including amendments under pension relief legislation, defines the minimum amount we must contribute to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. In determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts, we consider various factors, including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences, maintaining minimum CAS funding requirements, and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan. The contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors, including published IRS interest rates, the actual return on plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and demographic experience. These factors and our resulting contributions also impact the funded status of the plans. \n50\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nWe made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022: \nYear Ended December 31\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPension plans\nDiscretionary\nQualified\n$\n—\n \n$\n— \n$\n— \nNon-qualified\n11\n \n12 \n10 \nOther benefit plans\n36\n \n32 \n31 \nTotal contributions\n$\n47\n \n$\n44 \n$\n41 \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our qualified pension plans were funded 125% and 114%, respectively on a FAS basis. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these plans were sufficiently funded on an ERISA basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions. The funded percentages under ERISA and FAS vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the respective obligations. We expect our 2025 cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be less than $1 million, all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and which are exclusive of CAS cost recoveries in our contracts. Due to the differences in calculation methodologies, our FAS expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or CAS cost recoveries.\nWe expect 2025 contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately $34 million, which are exclusive of CAS cost recoveries under our contracts. Contributions for other postretirement benefit plans are not required to be funded in advance and are paid on an as-incurred basis.\nOther Sources and Uses of Capital\nStockholder Distributions - \nIn November 2024, our board of directors authorized an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $\n1.35\n per share. The board previously increased the quarterly cash dividend to $\n1.30\n per share in November 2023 and $\n1.24\n per share in November 2022. We paid cash dividends totaling $\n206\n million ($5.25 per share), $\n200\n million ($5.02 per share), and $\n192\n million ($4.78 per share) in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nIn January 2024, our board of directors authorized an increase to our stock repurchase program from $\n3.2\n billion to $\n3.8\n billion and an extension of the term of the program to December 31, 2028.\n Repurchases are made from time to time at management's discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased \n607,841\n shares at an aggregate cost of $\n163\n million, including $\n1\n million of accrued excise tax. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased \n337,007\n and \n244,561\n shares, respectively, at aggregate costs of $\n75\n million and $\n52\n million, respectively. The cost of repurchased shares is recorded as treasury stock in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nAdditional Capital \n- In November 2024, we issued $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of 5.353% senior notes due 2030 and $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of 5.749% senior notes due 2035. The net proceeds from these senior notes were expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment (which may include repayment of our \n3.844\n% senior notes due 2025 and commercial paper borrowings) and working capital.\nIn September 2024, we amended and restated our existing $\n1.5\n billion credit facility, increasing the capacity thereunder to $\n1.7\n billion and extending the maturity date to September 2029 (the \"Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility\"). The Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility of $\n300\n million. \nIn September 2024, our borrowing capacity under our unsecured commercial paper note program increased from $\n1\n billion to $\n1.7\n billion. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.\nContractual Obligations\n - Our future contractual obligations are related to debt, leases, pension liabilities, unrecognized tax benefits, workers compensation, and purchase obligations. See Note 12: Debt, Note 14: Leases, \n51\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nNote 16: Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, Note 11: Income Taxes, and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 for information about those obligations. Our purchase obligations as of December 31, 2024, were approximately $5,794 million, with approximately $2,708 million expected to be paid in 2025 and $3,086 million thereafter. A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. As of December 31, 2024, future scheduled periodic interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt, including commitment fees that we are obligated to pay on our existing $\n1.7\n billion Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, were approximately $687 million, with approximately $105 million expected to be paid in 2025 and $582 million thereafter.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we use letters of credit issued by commercial banks to support certain leases, insurance policies, and contractual performance obligations, as well as surety bonds issued by insurance companies principally to support our self-insured workers' compensation plans. As of December 31, 2024, $\n11\n million in letters of credit were issued but undrawn and $\n360\n million of surety bonds were outstanding. As of December 31, 2024, we had no other significant off-balance sheet arrangements.\n52\nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n \n \nGLOSSARY OF PROGRAMS\nIncluded below are brief descriptions of some of the programs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProgram Name\n  \nProgram Description\nAircraft carrier RCOH\nPerform refueling and complex overhaul (\"RCOH\") of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, which is required at the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.
