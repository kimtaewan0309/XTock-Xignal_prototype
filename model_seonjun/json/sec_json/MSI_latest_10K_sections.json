Every day we work to deliver on our commitment of helping to create safer communities, safer schools, safer hospitals and safer businesses. Our work as a global leader in public safety and enterprise security is grounded in nearly 100 years of close customer and community collaboration. We design and advance technology for more than 100,000 public safety and enterprise customers in over 100 countries, driven by our commitment to help make everywhere safer for all.\nWe are building and connecting an ecosystem of safety and security technologies to help protect people, property and places, which includes Land Mobile Radio Communications (\"LMR\" or \"LMR Communications\"), Video Security and Access Control (\"Video\") and Command Center. Across all three technologies, we offer on-premises, cloud-based and hybrid software solutions, and services such as cybersecurity subscription services and managed and support services.\nWe support police, fire and other emergency responders to help protect communities, while our base of enterprise customers, including schools, hospitals, businesses and stadiums, continues to grow as the criticality of safety and security becomes increasingly important. As a provider to both public safety and enterprises, our technologies can connect those in need with those who can help, enabling the collaboration that is critical for a more proactive approach to safety and security. \nWe are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as the successor to an Illinois corporation, Motorola, Inc., organized in 1928. We changed our name from Motorola, Inc. to Motorola Solutions, Inc. on January 4, 2011. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 W. Monroe St., Chicago, Illinois 60661.\nBusiness Organization\nWe manage our business organizationally through two segments: “Products and Systems Integration” and “Software and Services.” Within these segments, we have three principal product lines in which we report net sales:\n•\nLMR Communications: Infrastructure, devices (two-way radio and broadband, including both for public safety and professional and commercial radio (\"PCR\")) and software that enable communications, inclusive of installation and integration, backed by services, to assure availability, security and resiliency; \n•\nVideo: Cameras (fixed, body-worn, in-vehicle), access control, sensors, infrastructure, video management, software and artificial intelligence (\"AI\")-powered analytics that help enable visibility and bring attention to what’s important; and\n•\nCommand Center: Command center solutions and software applications that unify voice, video, data and analytics from public safety agencies, enterprises and the community to create a broad informational view to help simplify workflows and improve the accuracy and speed of decisions. \nThe Company has invested across these three technologies organically and through acquisitions to evolve its LMR focus and expand its safety and security products and services.\nOur strategy is to generate value through our technologies that help meet the changing needs of our customers around the world in protecting people, property and places. While each technology individually strives to make users safer and more productive, we believe we can enable better outcomes for our customers when we unite these technologies to work together. Our goal is to help remove silos and barriers between people and technologies, so that data unifies, information flows, operations run and collaboration improves to help strengthen safety and security everywhere. One example of this collaboration is highlighted by a school setting. When a teacher presses a panic button on a phone, this can automatically notify local law enforcement of an emergency, trigger a lockdown to secure all entries, share live video feeds with first responders and send mass notifications to key stakeholders inside and outside the school, helping schools to detect, respond and resolve safety and security threats.\nThe principal products within each segment, by technology, are described below:\nProducts and Systems Integration Segment\n \nIn 2024, the segment’s net sales were $6.9 billion, representing 64% of our consolidated net sales.    \nLMR Communications\nOur LMR Communications technology includes infrastructure and devices for LMR, as well as devices for public safety Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) and public carrier LTE. Our technology enables voice and multimedia collaborations across two-way radio, WiFi and public and private broadband networks. We are a global leader in the two-way radio category, including Project 25 (P25), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (“TETRA”) and Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), as well as other PCR solutions. We also deliver LTE solutions for public safety, government and commercial users, including devices operating in both low-band and mid-band frequencies, including Citizens’ Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) frequencies. We also offer High Frequency (HF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) communications technology to military, government and relief agency customers who require dynamic and mobile point-to-point voice communications in remote environments without the need for fixed infrastructure.\n We believe that public safety agencies and enterprises continue to trust LMR communications systems and devices because they are purpose-built and designed for reliability, availability, security and resiliency to help keep people connected even during the most challenging conditions. \n4\nBy extending our two-way radios with broadband data capabilities, we strive to provide our customers with greater functionality and multimedia access to the information and data they need in their workflows. Examples include application services such as GPS location to better protect lone workers, job dispatch to assign tasks and work orders and over-the-air programming to optimize device uptime. Our view is that complementary data applications such as these enable government, public safety and enterprise customers to work more efficiently and safely, while maintaining their mission-critical voice communications to remain connected and working in collaboration with others.\nPrimary sources of revenue for this technology come from selling devices and building communications systems, including the installation and integration of our infrastructure equipment within our customers’ technology environments. The LMR technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represented 83% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nVideo\nOur Video technology includes video management infrastructure, AI-powered security cameras including fixed and certain mobile video equipment, as well as on-premises and cloud-based access control solutions. We deploy video security and access control solutions to thousands of government and enterprise customers around the world, including schools, transportation systems, healthcare centers, public venues, commercial real estate, utilities, prisons, factories, casinos, airports, financial institutions, government facilities, state and local law enforcement agencies and retailers. Organizations such as these utilize video security and access control to verify critical events or incidents in real-time and to provide data to investigate an event or incident after it happens.\nOur view is that government and public safety customers are increasingly turning to video security technologies, including fixed and mobile cameras, to increase visibility, accountability and safety for communities and first responders alike. \nThe Video technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represented 17% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nSoftware and Services Segment\nIn 2024, the segment’s net sales were $3.9 billion, representing 36% of our consolidated net sales.\nLMR Communications\nLMR Communications services include support and managed services, which offer a broad continuum of support for our customers. Support services include repair and replacement, technical support and preventative maintenance, and more advanced offerings such as system monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services. Managed services range from partial to full operational support of customer-owned or Motorola Solutions-owned communications systems. Our customers’ systems often have multi-year or multi-decade lifespans that help drive demand for software upgrades, device and infrastructure refresh opportunities, as well as additional services to monitor, manage, maintain and secure these complex networks and solutions. We strive to deliver services to our customers that help improve performance across their systems, devices and applications for greater safety and productivity.\nGiven the mission-critical nature of our customers’ operational environments, we aim to design the LMR networks they rely on for availability, security and resiliency. We have a comprehensive approach to system upgrades that addresses hardware, software and implementation services. As new system releases become available, we work with our customers to upgrade software, hardware, or both, with respect to site controllers, comparators, routers, LAN switches, servers, dispatch consoles, logging equipment, network management terminals, network security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection sensors, on-site or remotely.\nThe LMR technology within the Software and Services segment represented 60% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nVideo\nVideo software includes video network management software, decision management and digital evidence management software, certain mobile video equipment and advanced vehicle location data analysis software, including license plate recognition. Our software is designed to complement video hardware systems, providing end-to-end video security to help keep people, property and places safe. \nOur video network management software is embedded with AI-powered analytics to deliver operational insights to our customers by bringing attention to important events within their video footage. Given the growing volume of video content, we believe that analytics are critical to delivering meaningful, action-oriented insights. Our view is that these insights can help to proactively detect an important event in real time as well as reactively search video content to detect an important event that occurred in the past. For example, AI-powered analytics can highlight a person at a facility out of hours (unusual activity), locate a missing child at a theme park (appearance search), flag a vehicle of interest at a school (license plate recognition), send an alert if doors to a restricted area are propped open at a hospital (access control), or trigger a school's customized lockdown plan while simultaneously alerting first responders and sharing video footage from inside the school.\n5\nOur cloud technologies can offer organizations the ability to access, search and manage their video security, intrusion and access control system from a centralized dashboard, accessible on remote devices such as smartphones and laptops. Additionally, our on-premises fixed video systems can be connected to the cloud, providing our customers with the ability to securely access and manage video across their sites from a remote or central monitoring location. We believe that governments, public safety agencies and enterprises are increasingly turning to scalable, cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control to make their facilities more secure. \nOur Video services include our \"video-as-a-service\" subscription-based offerings for law enforcement, simplifying procurement by bundling hardware and software into a single subscription. For example, body cameras and in-car video systems can be paired with either on-premises or cloud-based digital evidence management software and complementary command center products. Our cloud solutions are also sold as-a-service, available as single-year to multi-year hosted services, supporting our customers with upgrades and software enhancements to help ensure system performance and technological advancement.\nThe Video technology within the Software and Services segment represented 20% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nCommand Center\nOur Command Center portfolio consists of cloud-native, on-premises and hybrid software solutions that support the complex process of the public safety workflow from \"911 call to case closure.\" From the moment a person contacts 911, an array of individuals engage to gather information, coordinate a response and manage the incident to resolution. These individuals include call takers who answer and triage 911 calls; dispatchers who route calls to police, fire and emergency medical services to manage the response; first responders who support on scene; intelligence analysts who support the incident; records and evidence specialists who preserve information and evidence; detectives who manage cases; crime analysts who identify patterns and accelerate investigations; and corrections officers who oversee jail and inmate management. \nTo help ensure that individuals within the public safety workflow can work as efficiently, effectively and safely as possible, we believe it’s important that individuals within enterprises and communities can communicate and collaborate directly with public safety agencies, particularly during emergencies. Our Command Center portfolio offers solutions that are designed to help community members, enterprises and public safety agencies work together and share information in an effort to help prevent critical events from escalating and better inform an emergency response when an incident unfolds.\nOur Command Center software is designed to support an emergency response. In the 911 communications center, we offer call-taking and management software (including multimedia communication capabilities and AI-powered call transcription and language translation), and voice and computer-aided dispatch software to assign first responders to incidents. For emergency management teams, we offer mass notification and alerting (including panic button mobile applications), and incident collaboration software that aids in coordinating a multi-disciplinary response. In the field, we offer mobile applications that help first responders to collaborate with each other, remain connected to the information they need, manage an incident, capture critical information to support investigations, and remotely file reports. For information and support services teams, we offer integrated records and evidence management software, as well as solutions for managing tips and publishing crime maps to aid community engagement. For intelligence and investigations teams, we offer software that can unify voice, video and data in order to increase situational awareness from a single map-based view during a real-time incident response, and investigative tools to help uncover connections across records to generate leads and help close cases. For enterprises, we provide incident management and business resilience solutions that help secure people and facilities, as well as share information with public safety when an incident necessitates it.\nAnother area of public safety evolution is the increasing adoption of Next Generation 911 Core Services (“NGCS”), a group of products and services needed to create infrastructure connectivity in order to process a 911 call using Next Generation (“NG”) technology. The NG infrastructure is an Emergency Service IP Network (\"ESInet\"), which can carry voice, data and multimedia. ESInet enables 911 call takers at public safety answering points to respond to text, video and data. Our NGCS can be offered as a managed service and includes call routing, ESInet, location services, geographic information services, cybersecurity and our continuous communications network and security operations center dedicated to public safety. \nCommand Center also includes interoperability solutions that provide connectivity across LMR and broadband networks to help ensure that communication is not limited by coverage area, network technology or device type. Additionally, Command Center includes push-to-talk (\"PTT\") devices that deliver voice communications over LTE and Wi-Fi, and advanced back-end systems that enable and manage interoperable communications, capable of scaling from small enterprises to nationwide cellular networks. For example, a two-way radio network can connect with an LTE network, assisting individuals in communicating securely and more easily across technologies. These solutions can provide our public safety customers with the critical interoperability between multiple agencies' networks, facilitating a coordinated response.\nFinally, as the Command Center market continues to evolve from on-premises to hybrid and cloud technologies to improve their operations, we offer both cloud-native applications and cloud features that enhance on-premises applications. We believe this flexibility helps our customers to optimize their investments and enhance their systems with the technologies of their choice. \n The Command Center technology within the Software and Services segment represented 20% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\n6\nOur Customers and Contracts\nWe serve government agencies, state and local public safety agencies, as well as commercial and industrial customers. Our customer base is fragmented and widespread when considering the many levels of government, public safety agency and private sector decision-makers that procure and use our products and services. Serving this global customer base spanning federal, state, county, province, territory, municipal, and departmental independent bodies, along with our enterprise and industrial customers, requires a significant go-to-market investment.\nOur sales model includes both direct sales by our in-house sales force, which tends to focus on our largest accounts, and sales through our channel partner program. Our trained channel partners include independent dealers, distributors and software vendors around the world. The dealers and distributors each have their own sales organizations that complement and extend the reach of our sales force. The independent software vendors offer customized applications that meet the specific needs of the customers we serve.\nOur largest customer is the U.S. government (through multiple contracts with its various branches and agencies, including the armed services) representing approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales in 2024. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings over several quarters as many of our contracts with the U.S. government are long-term in nature. All contracts with the U.S. government, and certain other government agencies within the U.S., are subject to cancellation at the customer’s convenience. For a discussion of risks related to these contracts and customer relationships, please refer to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.\nPayment terms with our customers vary worldwide. Generally, contractual payment terms range from 30 to 45 days from the invoice date within North America and typically do not exceed 90 days from the invoice date in regions outside of North America. A portion of our contracts include implementation milestones, such as delivery, installation, and system acceptance, which generally take six months to two years to complete. Invoicing the customer is typically dependent on completion of the milestones. We generally do not grant extended payment terms. As required for competitive reasons, we may provide long-term financing in connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase price. Refer to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks related to requests by customers to provide vendor financing.\nGenerally, our contracts do not include a right of return, other than for standard warranty provisions. Due to customer purchasing patterns and the cyclical nature of the markets we serve, our sales historically have tended to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being the highest.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances. Competitive factors in these markets include product quality and reliability, technological capabilities, cost-effectiveness and industry experience. In operating in these competitive markets, we have broadened how we work with our customers, expanding from our global LMR technology platform to include an integrated suite of physical security solutions via our Video and Command Center capabilities. The interplay of technologies, guided by our deep knowledge of public safety and enterprise workflows, delivers customers one connected system to unify their critical communications, video security, access control, data, and analytics streams.\nWe experience widespread competition from a growing number of existing and new competitors.\nOur major competitors within our LMR, Video and Command Center technologies include the following companies:\nTechnology\nCompetitor\nLMR\nAirbus, BK Technologies, Hytera, iCOM, JVCKenwood Corporation, L3Harris Technologies, RCA, Samsung, Sepura, Tait, Zebra\nVideo\nAllegion, Assa Abloy, Axis Communications, Axon Enterprise, Bosch, Brivo, Dahua Technology Company, dormakaba, Eagle Eye Networks, Flock, Genetec, Hanwha Group, Hikvision, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Milestone Systems, Rhombus, Spectrum Brands, Verkada\nCommand Center\nAlertMedia, Axon Enterprise, Carbyne, CentralSquare Technologies, Comtech Telecommunications, Everbridge, Hexagon, Intrado, Mark43, NICE Public Safety, Onsolve, Oracle Public Safety, Tyler Technologies, Versaterm\nOther Information\nBacklog\nOur backlog includes orders that have been received and are believed to be firm. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our backlog was as follows:\n \nDecember 31\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nProducts and Systems Integration\n$\n4,135 \n$\n4,993 \nSoftware and Services\n10,562 \n9,266 \n$\n14,697 \n$\n14,259 \n7\nApproximately 57% of the Products and Systems Integration segment backlog and 24% of the Software and Services segment backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2025. The firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to change. In 2023, our backlog in the Software and Services segment for Airwave services contracted with the Home Office through December 31, 2026 was reduced by $777 million to align with the legal order imposed by the Competition and Markets Authority (\"CMA\") which implemented a prospective price control on Airwave (the \"Charge Control\"). In 2024, as a result of the Home Office's notice of a contract extension (the \"Deferred National Shutdown Notice\"), we recorded additional backlog of $748 million to reflect an incremental three years of services extending through December 31, 2029. Subsequently, we filed an action with the U.K. High Court challenging the Deferred National Shutdown Notice as being in breach of U.K. procurement and public law. The trial in this matter is currently set to commence on April 22, 2025. The backlog related to the incremental years of service contemplated in the Deferred National Shutdown Notice could change depending on the outcome of proceedings. Refer to \"Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Airwave contract with the U.K.\n8\nRecent Acquisitions\nSegment\nTechnology\nAcquisition\nDescription\nPurchase Price\nDate of Acquisition\nSoftware and Services\nCommand Center\n3tc Software\nProvider of control room software solutions.\n$22 million and share-based compensation of $4 million\nOctober 29, 2024\nSoftware and Services\nCommand Center\nNoggin\nProvider of cloud-based business continuity planning, operational resilience and critical event management software.\n$91 million and share-based compensation of $19 million\nJuly 1, 2024\nSoftware and Services\nVideo Security and Access Control\nUnnamed vehicle location and management solutions business\nProvider of vehicle location and management solutions.\n$132 million and share-based compensation of $3 million\nJuly 1, 2024\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nSilent Sentinel\nProvider of specialized, long-range cameras.\n$37 million\nFebruary 13, 2024\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nIPVideo\nCreator of a multifunctional safety and security device.\n$170 million and share-based compensation of $5 million\nDecember 15, 2023\nSoftware and Services\nCommand Center\nRave Mobile\nProvider of mass notification and incident management services.\n$553 million and share-based compensation of $2 million\nDecember 14, 2022\nProducts and Systems Integration\nLMR Communications\nFuturecom\nProvider of radio coverage extension solutions.\n$30 million\nOctober 25, 2022\nProducts and Systems Integration\nLMR Communications\nBarrett Communications\nProvider of specialized radio communications.\n$18 million\nAugust 8, 2022\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nVideotec\nProvider of ruggedized video security solutions.\n$23 million and share-based compensation of $4 million\nMay 12, 2022\nSoftware and Services\nVideo Security and Access Control\nCalipsa\nProvider of cloud-native advanced video analytics.\n$39 million and share-based compensation of $4 million\nApril 19, 2022\nSoftware and Services\nLMR Communications\nTETRA Ireland\nProvider of Ireland's National Digital Radio Service.\n$120 million\nMarch 23, 2022\nProducts and Systems Integration\nSoftware and Services\nVideo Security and Access Control\nAva\nProvider of cloud-native video security and analytics.\n$388 million and share-based awards and compensation of $7 million\nMarch 3, 2022\n9\nResearch and Development\nWe prioritize investments in research and development (\"R&D\") to expand and improve our products through both new product introductions and continuous enhancements to our core products. Our R&D programs are focused on the development of LMR Communications, Video and Command Center.\nR&D expenditures were $917 million in 2024, $858 million in 2023 and $779 million in 2022. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 9,000 employees engaged in R&D activities. In addition, we engage in R&D activities with joint development and manufacturing partners and outsource certain activities to engineering firms to further supplement our internal spend. \nIntellectual Property Matters\nPatent protection is an important aspect of our operations. We have a portfolio of U.S. and foreign utility and design patents relating to our products, systems and technologies, including developments in radio frequency technology and circuits, wireless network technologies, over-the-air protocols, mission-critical communications, software and services, video security and access control, and next-generation enterprise and public safety. Each year, we also file new patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices.\nWe license some of our patents to third-parties, but licensing is not a significant source of revenue for our business. We are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to the license. Motorola Solutions has a royalty-free license under all of the patents and patent applications assigned to Motorola Mobility at the time of the separation of the two businesses in 2011.\nWe actively participate in the development of standards for interoperable systems. Our patents are used in standards in which our products and services are based. We offer standards-based licenses to those patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.\nWe believe that our patent portfolio will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas as well as provide leverage in the development of future technologies. While we are not dependent upon a single patent or even a few patents, we do have patents that protect features and functionality of our products and services. While these patents are important, our success also depends upon our extensive know-how, innovative culture, technological leadership and distribution channels. We do not rely solely on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position; however, we will enforce our intellectual property rights when it is necessary to protect our innovation, or in some cases where attempts to negotiate mutually-agreeable licenses are not successful.\nWe seek to obtain patents, copyright registrations, and trademark registrations to protect our proprietary positions whenever possible and wherever practical. As of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 6,485 granted patents in the U.S. and foreign countries and had approximately 725 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Foreign patents and patent applications are mostly counterparts of our U.S. patents. During 2024, we were granted approximately 265 patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nWe no longer own certain logos and other trademarks, trade names and service marks, including MOTOROLA, MOTO, MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS and the Stylized M logo and all derivatives thereof (“Motorola Marks”) and, since 2010, we have licensed the Motorola Marks from Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC. which is currently owned by Motorola Mobility. For a description of the risks we face related to intellectual property, refer to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nInventory and Raw Materials\nOur practice is to carry inventory levels to meet customers' delivery requirements. We provide custom products that require the stocking of inventories and a large variety of piece parts and replacement parts in order to meet delivery and warranty requirements. To the extent supplier product life cycles are shorter than ours, stocking of lifetime buy inventories may be required to meet long-term warranty and contractual requirements. In addition, replacement parts are stocked for delivery on customer demand within a short delivery cycle.\nWe currently procure certain materials and components from single-source vendors. A material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If certain single-source suppliers were to become capacity-constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, we import materials and components that are subject to import duties. As of December 31, 2024, the duties and tariffs we are subject to did not have a significant impact on our financial results.\nWe engage with global contract manufacturers who manufacture the majority of our products, across a diverse network of manufacturing locations worldwide, including facilities for our products in Mexico, Malaysia and Canada. We also manufacture, assemble, customize, stage and integrate products in the U.S.\nLabor is generally available in reasonable proximity to our manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our largest outsourced manufacturing suppliers. As needed, we may subcontract work to other companies to fulfill customer needs in geographical areas that we do not have coverage for or for additional services that we do not provide. \n10\nNatural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy for our manufacturing operations. In addition, other rare earth materials are components used within our semiconductor manufacturing operations. Each of these resources is currently in adequate supply for our operations. The cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices and external third-party logistics rates for inbound and outbound air lanes. Difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned resources, or significant cost increases, could affect our financial results. \nFor a description of risks related to our supply chain, our utilization of third-parties to manufacture our products, and our use of the services of subcontractors, refer to \"Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors: of this Form 10-K.\nGovernment Regulations\nEnvironment, Worker Health and Safety & Climate Regulations\nSome of our operations, both ongoing and discontinued, are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as relating to the protection of the environment. Certain products of ours are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in products. \nCertain aspects of our operations and supply chain have become, and are expected to become, increasingly subject to federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and international treaties and industry standards relating to climate change and other environmental and social impacts, risks and opportunities. For example, in the European Union (the \"EU\"), the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and EU taxonomy initiatives will introduce, in staggered timelines, additional due diligence and disclosure requirements addressing sustainability that will apply to us in the coming years.\nRadio Spectrum Regulations\nRadio spectrum is required to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum is allocated to wireless services, including commercial and public safety users. We manufacture and market products and provide services in spectrum bands already allocated by regulatory bodies. These include voice and data infrastructure, mobile radios and portable or hand-held devices. Consequently, our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted by regulatory agencies. Our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum. The availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities. Conversely, the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands (e.g., the sharing of previously dedicated or other spectrum) may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed. Based on growing demands for broadband, regulators continue to consider repurposing narrowband spectrum to broadband. \nTelecommunications Regulations\nCertain of our offerings include telecommunications or other communications services that are or may be subject to regulation in various federal, state, and international jurisdictions. For example, we are a provider of selective routing services for 911 calls in the US, which subjects us to various regulations, including those for 911 service reliability. As another example, we provide WAVE PTX push-to-talk offerings with and without telecommunications connectivity in various countries internationally. Additional types of regulations applicable to our offerings that include telecommunications or other communications services may include certification or licensing requirements, cybersecurity and incident reporting obligations, and regulatory fee requirements. If we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, and restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services.\nArtificial Intelligence and Biometrics Regulations\nThe U.S. federal government and many state and local governments have adopted or are considering laws or regulations governing the use of AI and biometrics, including facial recognition and license plate recognition technology, which in some instances cover certain products and services we offer. Similar laws and regulations are being enacted or considered in some jurisdictions outside the U.S., including the EU. Such regulation could impact a number of our products, including video security products that include AI technology.\nCompliance with the laws currently in effect described above did not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in 2022, 2023 and 2024. For a description of the risks we face related to these and other regulatory matters, refer to “Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\n11\nHuman Capital Management\nWe have a \"people first\" philosophy. Our employees are our driving force, drawn from all segments of our global society to make a difference for our customers. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 21,000 people globally with 51% in the North America region and 49% in the International region. Of our total global employees, 40% were employed in engineering. \nOur goal is to foster a workplace where our employees feel that their unique perspectives, cultures and abilities contribute to their personal success, as well as our Company’s success. We believe the next big idea can come from anyone, anywhere, at any time. We offer structured mentorship and rotational programs and invest in employees’ development and training, enabling them to network, develop and grow their skills to influence the future of public safety and enterprise security. Employees also have access to a wide variety of technical, functional and professional skills learning resources, including virtual, self-directed courses and on-the-job learning opportunities. \nWe strive for business growth by creating a supportive, equitable and inclusive environment where employees feel engaged, connected to our business and invested in the collective success of our customers and communities. Our human resources team works with leaders within each business function to perform annual talent reviews to assess the performance of every team member and identify development opportunities, which complement our additional specialized training for such leaders to use our corporate values to guide behaviors and lead teams. This comprehensive process fosters growth across our Company by focusing on our high-potential talent and the rigor of succession plan development for our most critical roles. \nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we strive to offer and maintain market-competitive wages, incentives and benefits for our employees to attract and retain talent, and we review our rewards programs each year in an effort to ensure they are competitive with local market practices in the industries and countries where we operate. More specifically, our total rewards package for our global employees includes broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare, wellness and retirement benefits, paid parental and family leave, commuter benefits, paid time off (including flexible time off for U.S. exempt employees), flexible work options and other assistance and support for employees going through life-changing events.\nWe are committed to fostering a culture where all of our employees can thrive, our customers and communities are supported, and our partners recognize and share in our values.

  "item7": "Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing under “Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nMotorola Solutions' business is safety and security. Every day we work to deliver on our commitment of helping to create safer communities, safer schools, safer hospitals and safer businesses. Our work as a global leader in public safety and enterprise security is grounded in nearly 100 years of close customer and community collaboration. We design and advance technology for more than 100,000 public safety and enterprise customers in over 100 countries, driven by our commitment to help make everywhere safer for all.\nWe manage our business organizationally through two segments: “Products and Systems Integration” and “Software and Services.” Within these segments, we have three principal product lines in which we report net sales: LMR Communications, Video and Command Center.\nThe Company has invested across these three technologies organically and through acquisitions to evolve its LMR focus and expand its safety and security products and services.\nOur strategy is to generate value through our technologies that help meet the changing needs of our customers around the world in protecting people, property and places. While each technology individually strives to make users safer and more productive, we believe we can enable better outcomes for our customers when we unite these technologies to work together. Our goal is to help remove silos and barriers between people and technologies, so that data unifies, information flows, operations run and collaboration improves to help strengthen safety and security everywhere. Across all three technologies, we offer on-premises, cloud-based and hybrid software solutions, and services such as cybersecurity subscription services and managed and support services.\nOne example of this collaboration is highlighted by a school setting. When a teacher presses a panic button on a phone, this can automatically notify local law enforcement of an emergency, trigger a lockdown to secure all entries, share live video feeds with first responders and send mass notifications to key stakeholders inside and outside the school, helping schools to detect, respond and resolve safety and security threats.\nThe principal products within each segment, by technology, are described below:\nProducts and Systems Integration Segment\n \nIn 2024, the segment’s net sales were $6.9 billion, representing 64% of our consolidated net sales.\nLMR Communications\nOur LMR Communications technology includes infrastructure and devices for LMR, as well as devices for public safety Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) and public carrier LTE. Our technology enables voice and multimedia collaborations across two-way radio, WiFi and public and private broadband networks. We are a global leader in the two-way radio category, including Project 25 (P25), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (\"TETRA\") and Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), as well as other PCR solutions. We also deliver LTE solutions for public safety, government and commercial users, including devices operating in both low-band and mid-band frequencies, including Citizens’ Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) frequencies. We also offer High Frequency (HF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) communications technology to military, government and relief agency customers who require dynamic and mobile point-to-point voice communications in remote environments without the need for fixed infrastructure.\nWe believe that public safety agencies and enterprises continue to trust LMR communications systems and devices because they are purpose-built and designed for reliability, availability, security and resiliency to help keep people connected even during the most challenging conditions.\nBy extending our two-way radios with broadband data capabilities, we strive to provide our customers with greater functionality and multimedia access to the information and data they need in their workflows. Examples include application services such as GPS location to better protect lone workers, job dispatch to assign tasks and work orders and over-the-air programming to optimize device uptime. Our view is that complementary data applications such as these enable government, public safety and enterprise customers to work more efficiently and safely, while maintaining their mission-critical voice communications to remain connected and working in collaboration with others. \nPrimary sources of revenue for this technology come from selling devices and building communications systems, including infrastructure, the installation and integration of our infrastructure equipment within our customers’ technology environments. The LMR technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represent\ned 83%\n of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\n33\nVideo\nOur Video technology includes video management infrastructure, AI-powered security cameras including fixed and certain mobile video equipment, as well as on-premises and cloud-based access control solutions. We deploy video security and access control solutions to thousands of government and enterprise customers around the world, including schools, transportation systems, healthcare centers, public venues, commercial real estate, utilities, prisons, factories, casinos, airports, financial institutions, government facilities, state and local law enforcement agencies and retailers. Organizations such as these utilize video security and access control to verify critical events or incidents in real-time and to provide data to investigate an event or incident after it happens.\nOur view is that government and public safety customers are increasingly turning to video security technologies, including fixed and mobile cameras, to increase visibility, accountability and safety for communities and first responders alike. \nThe Video technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represented 17% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nSoftware\n \nand Services Segment\nIn 2024, the segment’s net sales were $3.9 billion, representing 36% of our consolidated net sales. \nLMR Communications\nLMR Communications services include support and managed services, which offer a broad continuum of support for our customers. Support services include repair and replacement, technical support and preventative maintenance, and more advanced offerings such as system monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services. Managed services range from partial to full operational support of customer-owned or Motorola Solutions-owned communications systems. Our customers’ systems often have multi-year or multi-decade lifespans that help drive demand for software upgrades, device and infrastructure refresh opportunities, as well as additional services to monitor, manage, maintain and secure these complex networks and solutions. We strive to deliver services to our customers that help improve performance across their systems, devices and applications for greater safety and productivity.\nGiven the mission-critical nature of our customers’ operational environments, we aim to design the LMR networks they rely on for availability, security and resiliency. We have a comprehensive approach to system upgrades that addresses hardware, software and implementation services. As new system releases become available, we work with our customers to upgrade software, hardware, or both, with respect to site controllers, comparators, routers, LAN switches, servers, dispatch consoles, logging equipment, network management terminals, network security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection sensors, on-site or remotely. \nThe LMR technology within the Software and Services segment represente\nd 60% o\nf the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nVideo\nVideo software includes video network management software, decision management and digital evidence management software, certain mobile video equipment and advanced vehicle location data analysis software, including license plate recognition. Our software is designed to complement video hardware systems, providing end-to-end video security to help keep people, property and places safe. \nOur video network management software is embedded with AI-powered analytics to deliver operational insights to our customers by bringing attention to important events within their video footage. Given the growing volume of video content, we believe that analytics are critical to delivering meaningful, action-oriented insights. Our view is that these insights can help to proactively detect an important event in real time as well as reactively search video content to detect an important event that occurred in the past. For example, AI-powered analytics can highlight a person at a facility out of hours (unusual activity), locate a missing child at a theme park (appearance search), flag a vehicle of interest at a school (license plate recognition), send an alert if doors to a restricted area are propped open at a hospital (access control), or trigger a school's customized lockdown plan while simultaneously alerting first responders and sharing video footage from inside the school. \nOur cloud technologies can offer organizations the ability to access, search and manage their video security intrusion and access control system from a centralized dashboard, accessible on remote devices such as smartphones and laptops. Additionally, our on-premises fixed video systems can be connected to the cloud, providing our customers with the ability to securely access and manage video across their sites from a remote or central monitoring location. We believe that governments, public safety agencies and enterprises are increasingly turning to scalable, cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control to make their facilities more secure. \nOur Video services include our \"video-as-a-service\" subscription-based offerings for law enforcement, simplifying procurement by bundling hardware and software into a single subscription. For example, body cameras and in-car video systems can be paired with either on-premises or cloud-based digital evidence management software and complementary command center products. Our cloud solutions are also sold as-a-service, available as single-year to multi-year hosted services, supporting our customers with upgrades and software enhancements to help ensure system performance and technological advancement.\nThe Video technology within the Software and Services segment represente\nd 20%\n of the net sales of the total segment in 2024. \n34\nCommand Center\nOur Command Center portfolio consists of cloud-native, on-premises and hybrid software solutions that support the complex process of the public safety workflow from \"911 call to case closure.\" From the moment a person contacts 911, an array of individuals engage to gather information, coordinate a response and manage the incident to resolution. These individuals include call takers who answer and triage 911 calls; dispatchers who route calls to police, fire and emergency medical services to manage the response; first responders who support on scene; intelligence analysts who support the incident; records and evidence specialists who preserve information and evidence; detectives who manage cases; crime analysts who identify patterns and accelerate investigations; and corrections officers who oversee jail and inmate management. \nTo help ensure that individuals within the public safety workflow can work as efficiently, effectively and safely as possible, we believe it’s important that individuals within enterprises and communities can communicate and collaborate directly with public safety agencies, particularly during emergencies. Our Command Center portfolio offers solutions that are designed to help community members, enterprises and public safety agencies work together and share information in an effort to help prevent critical events from escalating and better inform an emergency response when an incident unfolds.\nOur Command Center software is designed to support an emergency response. In the 911 communications center, we offer call taking and management software (including multimedia communication capabilities and AI-powered call transcription and language translation) and voice and computer-aided dispatch software to assign first responders to incidents. For emergency management teams, we offer mass notification and alerting (including panic button mobile applications) and incident collaboration software that aids in coordinating a multi-disciplinary response. In the field, we offer mobile applications that help first responders to collaborate with each other, remain connected to the information they need, manage an incident, capture critical information to support investigations, and remotely file reports. For information and support services teams, we offer integrated records and evidence management software, as well as solutions for managing tips and publishing crime maps to aid community engagement. For intelligence and investigations teams, we offer software that can unify voice, video and data in order to increase situational awareness from a single map-based view during a real-time incident response, and investigative tools to help uncover connections across records to generate leads and help close cases. For enterprises, we provide incident management and business resilience solutions that help secure people and facilities, as well as share information with public safety when an incident necessitates it.\nAnother area of public safety evolution is the increasing adoption of Next Generation 911 Core Services (“NGCS”), a group of products and services needed to create infrastructure connectivity in order to process a 911 call using Next Generation (“NG”) technology. The NG infrastructure is an Emergency Service IP Network (\"ESInet\"), which can carry voice, data and multimedia. ESInet enables 911 call takers at public safety answering points to respond to text, video and data. Our NGCS can be offered as a managed service and includes call routing, ESInet, location services, geographic information services, cybersecurity and our continuous communications network and security operations center dedicated to public safety.\nCommand Center also includes interoperability solutions that provide connectivity across LMR and broadband networks to help ensure that communication is not limited by coverage area, network technology or device type. Additionally, Command Center includes push-to-talk (\"PTT\") devices that deliver voice communications over LTE and Wi-Fi, and advanced back-end systems that enable and manage interoperable communications, capable of scaling from small enterprises to nationwide cellular networks. For example, a two-way radio network can connect with an LTE network, assisting individuals in communicating securely and more easily across technologies. These solutions can provide our public safety customers with the critical interoperability between multiple agencies' networks, facilitating a coordinated response.\nFinally, as the Command Center market continues to evolve from on-premises to hybrid and cloud technologies to improve their operations, we offer both cloud-native applications and cloud features that enhance on-premises applications. We believe this flexibility helps our customers to optimize their investments and enhance their systems with the technologies of their choice. \n The Command Center technology within the Software and Services segment represented\n 20% \nof the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\n2024 Financial Results\n•\nNet sales were $10.8 billion in 2024 compared to $10.0 billion in 2023.\n•\nOperating earnings were $2.7 billion in 2024 compared to $2.3 billion in 2023. \n•\nNet earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. were $1.6 billion, or $9.23 per diluted common share in 2024, compared to earnings of $1.7 billion, or $9.93 per diluted common share in 2023.\n•\nOur operating cash flow was $2.4 billion in 2024 compared to $2.0 billion in 2023. \n•\nWe returned approximately $898 million of capital to shareholders, in the form of $654 million in dividends and $244 million in share repurchases in 2024. Additionally, we repurchased the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 1.75% senior convertible notes issued to Silver Lake Partners and scheduled to mature in 2024 (\"the Silver Lake Convertible Debt\"), for $1.59 billion in cash, inclusive of the conversion premium.\n•\nWe increased our quarterly dividend by 11% to $1.09 per share in November 2024.\n•\nWe ended 2024 with a backlog position of $14.7 billion, up $438 million compared to 2023.\n35\nSegment Financial Highlights\n•\nIn the Products and Systems Integration segment, net sales were $6.9 billion in 2024, an increase of $641 million, or 10%, compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. On a geographic basis, net sales increased in both the North America and International regions. Operating earnings were $1.7 billion in 2024, compared to $1.2 billion in 2023. Operating margins increased in 2024 to 24.3% from 19.9% in 2023 primarily due to higher sales and favorable mix, partially offset by higher employee incentive costs, including share-based compensation, higher expenses related to legal matters, including Hytera-related expenses, and higher expenses associated with acquired businesses.\n•\nIn the Software and Services segment, net sales were $3.9 billion in 2024, an increase of $198 million, or 5%, compared to $3.7 billion in 2023. On a geographic basis, net sales increased in the North America region and decreased in the International region. Operating earnings were $1.0 billion in 2024, compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. Operating margins decreased in 2024 to 25.7% from 28.1% in 2023 primarily driven the revenue reduction on Airwave services in accordance with the Charge Control, higher employee incentive costs, including share-based compensation, higher expenses associated with acquired businesses and higher expenses related to legal matters, partially offset by higher sales and a reduction in intangible amortization expenses.\nRecent Events\nU.K. Home Office Update\nIn October 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority (\"CMA\") opened a market investigation into the Mobile Radio Network Services market. This investigation included Airwave, our private mobile radio communications network that we acquired in 2016. Airwave provides mission-critical voice and data communications to emergency services and other agencies in Great Britain. \nIn 2023, the CMA imposed a legal order on Airwave which implemented a prospective price control on Airwave (the \"Charge Control\"). After the Competition Appeal Tribunal (\"CAT\") dismissed our appeal of the CMA's final decision, we appealed the CAT's judgment to the United Kingdom Court of Appeal. On January 30, 2025, the United Kingdom Court of Appeal denied our application for permission to appeal the CAT's judgment. Since August 1, 2023, revenue under the Airwave contract has been, and will continue to be, recognized in accordance with the Charge Control.\nOn March 13, 2024, we received a notice of contract extension (the “Deferred National Shutdown Notice”) from the Home Office of the United Kingdom (the \"Home Office\"). The Deferred National Shutdown Notice extends the “national shutdown target date” of the Airwave service from December 31, 2026 to December 31, 2029, at the Charge Control rates. Our backlog for Airwave services contracted with the Home Office through December 31, 2026 was previously reduced by $777 million to align with the Charge Control. In 2024, as a result of the Home Office's notice of a contract extension pursuant to their Deferred National Shutdown Notice, we recorded additional backlog of $748 million to reflect the incremental three years of services. On April 11, 2024, we filed proceedings in the U.K. High Court challenging the decision of the Home Office to issue the Deferred National Shutdown Notice as being in breach of applicable U.K. procurement and public law. The hearing on this matter has been set to commence on April 22, 2025. The backlog related to the incremental years of service contemplated in the Deferred National Shutdown Notice could change depending on the outcome of the proceedings.\nOn December 5, 2024, a proposed class representative filed a claim with the CAT to bring collective proceedings against us, alleging that users of Airwave services during the period January 1, 2020 through July 31, 2023 suffered financial harm as a result of the pricing in effect during such time (the \"Collective Proceeding\"). The initial stage of the Collective Proceeding will involve \"Certification\" of the claim by the CAT, which we expect to be heard in 2025.\n36\nRecent Acquisitions\nSegment\nTechnology\nAcquisition\nDescription\nPurchase Price\nDate of Acquisition\nSoftware and Services\nCommand Center\n3tc Software\nProvider of control room software solutions.\n$22 million and share-based compensation of $4 million\nOctober 29, 2024\nSoftware and Services\nCommand Center\nNoggin\nProvider of cloud-based business continuity planning, operational resilience and critical event management software.\n$91 million and share-based compensation of $19 million\nJuly 1, 2024\nSoftware and Services\nVideo Security and Access Control\nUnnamed vehicle location and management solutions business\nProvider of vehicle location and management solutions.\n$132 million and share-based compensation of $3 million\nJuly 1, 2024\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nSilent Sentinel\nProvider of specialized, long-range cameras.\n$37 million\nFebruary 13, 2024\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nIPVideo\nCreator of a multifunctional safety and security device.\n$170 million and share-based compensation of $5 million\nDecember 15, 2023\nSoftware and Services\nCommand Center\nRave Mobile\nProvider of mass notification and incident management services.\n$553 million and share-based compensation of $2 million\nDecember 14, 2022\nProducts and Systems Integration\nLMR Communications\nFuturecom\nProvider of radio coverage extension solutions.\n$30 million\nOctober 25, 2022\nProducts and Systems Integration\nLMR Communications\nBarrett Communications\nProvider of specialized radio communications.\n$18 million\nAugust 8, 2022\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nVideotec\nProvider of ruggedized video security solutions.\n$23 million and share-based compensation of $4 million\nMay 12, 2022\nSoftware and Services\nVideo Security and Access Control\nCalipsa\nProvider of cloud-native advanced video analytics.\n$39 million and share-based compensation of $4 million\nApril 19, 2022\nSoftware and Services\nLMR Communications\nTETRA Ireland\nProvider of Ireland's National Digital Radio Service.\n$120 million\nMarch 23, 2022\nProducts and Systems Integration\nSoftware and Services\nVideo Security and Access Control\nAva\nProvider of cloud-native video security and analytics.\n$388 million and share-based awards and compensation of $7 million\nMarch 3, 2022\nClimate Change Regulations\nWe expect that our operations and supply chain will become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties and industry standards relating to climate change and other environmental and social impacts, risks and opportunities. For example, in the European Union (the “EU”), the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and EU taxonomy initiatives will introduce, in staggered timelines, additional due diligence and disclosure requirements addressing sustainability that will apply or we expect will apply, as applicable, to us in the coming years.\n37\nLooking Forward\nWe expect continued growth within our global LMR installed base as a number of events such as natural disasters and large-scale incidents continue to reinforce the importance of having secure, reliable LMR for public safety. We believe our augmentation of LMR with broadband solutions will also drive growth, as we expect our customers will look to integrate valuable data capabilities. We expect to provide additional services to existing LMR customers as communications systems become more complex, software-centric and data-driven. \nAs public safety needs continue to evolve, we anticipate growth opportunities within the command center as our Command Center portfolio supports the complex process of the public safety workflow from \"911 call to case closure.\" We expect increased growth across our portfolio that consists of native cloud, hybrid and on-premises software solutions that provide a migration path for our customers from on-premises solutions to cloud capabilities, as well as from the increasing adoption of NGCS.\nWithin Video, we expect growth across our portfolio of fixed and mobile video security solutions embedded with advanced analytics and access control solutions. We believe drivers include the expansion of traditional video sales beyond enterprise customers to governments and public safety customers. Additionally, we believe that governments, public safety agencies and enterprises are increasingly turning to scalable, cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control to make their facilities more secure with the ability to securely access, search and manage these systems across their sites from a remote or central monitoring location. We also expect customers to continue to embrace analytics that convert video data into actionable insights and offerings such as \"video-as-a-service.\"\nWe anticipate new opportunities from the investments we are making to integrate our LMR, Video and Command Center technologies into one unified safety and security ecosystem. We expect that our customers will continue to turn to cloud-based integrated solutions, as well as, we have made go-to-market and research and development investments in both Video and our Command Center technologies with growth in mind. We have made a number of acquisitions and we see opportunities to continue to rationalize costs within both segments of our business, further driving operating leverage in our businesses.\nResults of Operations \n \nYears ended December 31\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n% of\nSales **\n2023\n% of\nSales **\n2022\n% of\nSales **\nNet sales from products\n$\n6,454\n \n$\n5,814 \n$\n5,368 \nNet sales from services\n4,363\n \n4,164 \n3,744 \nNet sales\n10,817\n \n9,978 \n9,112 \nCosts of product sales\n2,674\n \n41.4\n \n%\n2,591 \n44.6 \n%\n2,595 \n48.3 \n%\nCosts of services sales\n2,631\n \n60.3\n \n%\n2,417 \n58.0 \n%\n2,288 \n61.1 \n%\nCosts of sales\n5,305\n \n49.0\n \n%\n5,008 \n50.2 \n%\n4,883 \n53.6 \n%\nGross margin\n5,512\n \n51.0\n \n%\n4,970 \n49.8 \n%\n4,229 \n46.4 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n1,752\n \n16.2\n \n%\n1,561 \n15.6 \n%\n1,450 \n15.9 \n%\nResearch and development expenditures\n917\n \n8.5\n \n%\n858 \n8.6 \n%\n779 \n8.5 \n%\nOther charges\n155\n \n1.4\n \n%\n257 \n2.6 \n%\n339 \n3.7 \n%\nOperating earnings\n2,688\n \n24.8\n \n%\n2,294 \n23.0 \n%\n1,661 \n18.2 \n%\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense, net\n(227)\n(2.1)\n%\n(216)\n(2.2)\n%\n(226)\n(2.5)\n%\nGains on sales of investments and businesses, net\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n— \n— \n%\n3 \n— \n%\nOther, net\n(489)\n(4.5)\n%\n68 \n0.7 \n%\n77 \n0.8 \n%\nTotal other expense\n(716)\n(6.6)\n%\n(148)\n(1.5)\n%\n(146)\n(1.6)\n%\nNet earnings before income taxes\n1,972\n \n18.2\n \n%\n2,146 \n21.5 \n%\n1,515 \n16.6 \n%\nIncome tax expense\n390\n \n3.6\n \n%\n432 \n4.3 \n%\n148 \n1.6 \n%\nNet earnings\n1,582\n \n14.6\n \n%\n1,714 \n17.2 \n%\n1,367 \n15.0 \n%\nLess: Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\n5\n \n—\n \n%\n5 \n0.1 \n%\n4 \n— \n%\nNet earnings*\n$\n1,577\n \n14.6\n \n%\n$\n1,709 \n17.1 \n%\n$\n1,363 \n15.0 \n%\nEarnings per diluted common share*\n$\n9.23\n \n \n$\n9.93 \n \n$\n7.93 \n \n*    Amounts attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. common shareholders.\n**    Percentages may not add due to rounding.\n38\nGeographic Market Sales by Locale of End Customer\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNorth America\n72\n \n%\n69 \n%\n70 \n%\nInternational\n28\n \n%\n31 \n%\n30 \n%\n \n100\n \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nResults of Operations—2024 Compared to 2023 \nNet Sales\n \nYears ended December 31\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet sales from Products and Systems Integration\n$\n6,883\n \n$\n6,242 \n10 \n%\nNet sales from Software and Services\n3,934\n \n3,736 \n5 \n%\nNet sales\n$\n10,817\n \n$\n9,978 \n8 \n%\nThe Products and Systems Integration segment’s net sales represented 64% of our net sales in 2024, compared to 63% of our net sales in 2023.

While we regularly repatriate funds, and a portion of offshore funds can be repatriated with minimal adverse financial impact, repatriation of some of these funds may be subject to delay due to local country approvals.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in operating cash flows from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by higher earnings, net of non-cash charges.\nThe increase in operating cash flows from 2022 to 2023 was driven by:\n•\nhigher earnings, net of non-cash charges; and\n•\nimproved working capital; partially offset by\n•\n$280 million of higher income tax payments, including a one-time $70 million cash tax payment made in 2023 related to an intra-group transfer of certain IP rights that was completed in 2022 (see \"Note 7: Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information).\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in net cash used for investing activities from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to:\n•\n$110 million increase in acquisitions and investments, driven by acquisitions and investments of $290 million in 2024 compared to $180 million in 2023; and\n•\n$4 million increase in capital expenditures in 2024 compared to 2023; partially offset by\n•\n$21 million increase in proceeds from the sale of investments in 2024 compared to 2023.\nThe decrease in net cash used for investing activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to:\n•\n$997 million decrease in acquisitions and investments, driven by acquisitions of $180 million in 2023 compared to $1.2 billion in 2022; and\n•\n$3 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2023 compared to 2022; partially offset by\n•\n$27 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments in 2023 compared to 2022.\n48\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase in cash used for financing activities in 2024 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2023 was driven by (also see further discussion in \"Debt,\" \"Credit Facilities,\" \"Share Repurchase Program\" and \"Dividends\" in this section below): \n•\n$1.9 billion increase in repayments of debt in 2024 primarily driven by the repurchase of the Silver Lake Convertible Debt and repayment of our 4.0% senior notes due 2024;\n•\n$654 million cash used for the payment of dividends in 2024 compared to $589 million in 2023; and\n•\n$75 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans in 2024 compared to $104 million in 2023; partially offset by\n•\n$1.3 billion in net proceeds in 2024 driven by the issuance of our 5.0% senior notes due 2029 and 5.4% senior notes due 2034; and\n•\n$247 million used for purchases under our share repurchase program in 2024 compared to $804 million in 2023.\nThe increase in cash used for financing activities in 2023 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2022 was driven by: \n•\n$589 million cash used for the payment of dividends in 2023 compared to $530 million in 2022; and\n•\n$104 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans in 2023 compared to $156 million in 2022; partially offset by\n•\n$595 million in net proceeds in 2022 from the issuance of $600 million of 5.6% senior notes due 2032, of which a portion was subsequently used to repurchase $275 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes due 2024 for a purchase price of $279 million, excluding $3 million of accrued interest; and\n•\n$804 million used for purchases under our share repurchase program in 2023 compared to $836 million in 2022.\nSales of Receivables\nWe may choose to sell accounts receivable and long-term receivables to third-parties under one-time arrangements. We may or may not retain the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and long-term receivables. \nThe following table summarizes the proceeds received from sales of accounts receivable and long-term receivables for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\nYears ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nContract-specific discounting facility\n$\n—\n \n$\n— \n$\n49 \nAccounts receivable sales proceeds\n15\n \n96 \n179 \nLong-term receivables sales proceeds\n205\n \n182 \n204 \nTotal proceeds from receivable sales\n$\n220\n \n$\n278 \n$\n432 \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $794 million of long-term receivables, compared to $813 million of long-term receivables at December 31, 2023. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables.\nDebt\nWe had outstanding long-term debt of $6.0 billion at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023, including the current portions of $322 million and $1.3 billion, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repaid the $313 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes due 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $252 million of 7.5% debentures due 2025, which mature in May 2025, and $70 million of 6.5% debentures due 2025, which mature in September 2025, were classified within the Current portion of long-term debt within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the debentures mature within the next twelve months.\nOn September 5, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue the Silver Lake Convertible Debt, which became fully convertible on September 5, 2021. On February 14, 2024, we agreed with Silver Lake Partners to repurchase $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Silver Lake Convertible Debt for aggregate consideration of $1.59 billion in cash, inclusive of the conversion premium. The repurchase of the Silver Lake Convertible Debt was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt, as the repurchase was negotiated under economically favorable terms outside of the original contractual conversion rate. A loss on the extinguishment of $585 million was recorded upon settlement, representing the excess of amounts repurchased over the carrying value of debt of $593 million, offset by accrued interest of $8 million. The loss on the extinguishment of debt was recorded within Other Income (Expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOn March 25, 2024, we issued $400 million of 5.0% senior notes due 2029 and $900 million of 5.4% senior notes due 2034. We recognized net proceeds of $1.3 billion after debt issuance costs and discounts. A portion of proceeds from the issuance was used to repurchase the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Silver Lake Convertible Debt.\n49\nIn May of 2022, we issued $600 million of 5.6% senior notes due 2032. We recognized net proceeds of $595 million after debt issuance costs and discounts. A portion of these proceeds was then used to repurchase $275 million in principal amount of the Company's 4.0% senior notes due 2024 pursuant to a cash tender offer, for a purchase price of $279 million, excluding $3 million of accrued interest. After accelerating the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, we recognized a loss of $6 million related to the tender offer in Other, net within Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe have an unsecured commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility described below, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion outstanding at any one time. At maturity, the notes are paid back in full including the interest component. The notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.\nCredit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a $2.25 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in March 2026 (the \"2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement\"). The 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit and fronting commitments of $450 million. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), at our option. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of December 31, 2024.\nWe have investment grade ratings on our senior unsecured long-term debt. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings upgraded our credit ratings to BBB from BBB-. We continue to believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets in the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThrough a series of actions, the Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate share repurchase amount of up to $18.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock (the “share repurchase program”). The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2024, we used approximately $15.8 billion of the share repurchase authority to repurchase shares, leaving approximately $2.2 billion of authority available for future repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid $3 million of 1% excise tax pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, related to our 2023 share repurchases in excess of issuances.\nOur share repurchases for 2024, 2023, and 2022 are summarized as follows:\nYear\nShares Repurchased (in millions)\nAverage Price\nAmount (in millions)\n2024\n0.6 \n$\n396.69 \n$\n244 \n2023\n2.9 \n278.56 \n804 \n2022\n3.7 \n225.00 \n836 \nDividends\nWe paid cash dividends to holders of our common stock of $654 million in 2024, $589 million in 2023, and $530 million in 2022. On January 15, 2025, we paid an additional $182 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock.\nAdequate Internal Funding Resources\nWe believe that we have adequate internal resources available to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our expected working capital, capital expenditure and cash requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, as supported by the level of cash and cash equivalents in the U.S., the ability to repatriate funds from foreign jurisdictions, cash provided by operations, as well as liquidity provided by our commercial paper program backed by the 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement.\nWe do not anticipate a material decrease to net future cash flows generated from operations. We expect to use our available cash, investments, and debt facilities to support and invest in our business. This includes investing in our existing products and technologies, seeking new acquisition opportunities related to our strategic growth initiatives and returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments (subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors) and share repurchases. Refer also to \"Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding access to the capital markets.\n50\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nSummarized in the table and text below are our short-term (within the next twelve months) and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024, which we expect to fund with a combination of operating cash flows, existing cash balances or, as needed, borrowings under new or existing debt:\n \nPayments Due by Period\n(in millions)\nShort-term\nLong-term\nLong-term debt obligations, gross\n(1)\n$\n322 \n$\n5,726 \nLease obligations\n(2)\n146 \n467 \nPurchase obligations\n(3)\n151 \n562 \nTotal obligations\n$\n619 \n$\n6,755 \n(1)\nAmounts included represent the estimated principal payments applicable to outstanding debt. Refer to \"Note 5: Debt and Credit Facilities\" in \"Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for discussion related to our long-term debt obligations.\n(2)\nWe lease certain office, factory and warehouse space, land, and other equipment, principally under non-cancelable operating leases. We are evaluating our real estate needs in order to identify opportunities to reduce long-term cash requirements for office space where practicable. Refer to \"Note 3: Leases\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these material lease obligations.\n(3)\nAmounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments. Such commitments include license agreements and agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. We do not anticipate the cancellation of any of our take-or-pay agreements in the future and estimate that purchases from these suppliers will exceed the minimum obligations during the agreement periods.\nOther Contingencies\nPotential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying Contract Value: \nIn certain circumstances, we enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the damages that could be claimed by the customer for failed performance might exceed the revenue we receive from the contract. Contracts with these types of uncapped damages provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still represent meaningful risk. There is a possibility that a claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result in expenses that are far in excess of the revenue received from the counterparty in connection with the contract.\nIndemnification Provisions:\n \nWe may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property agreements. Historically, we have not made significant payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant claims asserted against us. However, there is an increasing risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the current legal climate. In indemnification cases, payment by us is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow us to challenge the other party’s claims. In some instances we may have recourse against third-parties for certain payments made by us.\nLegal Matters: \nWe are a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved, or in the periods in which more information is obtained that changes management's opinion of the ultimate disposition.\nLong-term Customer Financing Commitments\nOutstanding Commitments:\n  Certain purchasers of our products and services may request that we provide long-term financing (defined as financing with a term of greater than one year) in connection with the sale of equipment. These requests may include all or a portion of the purchase price of the products and services. Our obligation to provide long-term financing may be conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of us by a reputable bank to support the purchaser's credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the long-term receivables from us. We had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third-parties totaling $105 million at December 31, 2024 and $103 million at December 31, 2023. \n51\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into arrangements which generally consist of multiple promises to our customers. We evaluate whether the promised goods and services are distinct or a series of distinct goods or services. Where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total estimated consideration to each performance obligation based on applying an estimated selling price (“ESP”) as our best estimate of standalone selling price. We use list price as the standalone selling price for sales sold through our channel partners. Given the unique nature of the goods and services we provide to direct customers, standalone sales of our products generally do not exist. Therefore, we determine ESP by: (i) collecting all reasonably available data points including historical sales, cost and margin analyses of the product or services, and other inputs based on our normal pricing and discounting practices, (ii) making any reasonably required adjustments to the data based on market and Company-specific factors, and (iii) stratifying the data points for similar customers and circumstances, when appropriate, based on major product or service, type of customer, geographic market, and sales volume.\nWe account for certain system contracts on an over time basis, electing an input method of estimated costs as a measure of performance completed. The selection of costs incurred as a measure of progress aligns the transfer of control to the overall production of the customized system.\nFor system contracts accounted for over time using estimated costs as a measure of performance completed, we rely on estimates around the total estimated costs to complete the contract (“Estimated Costs to Complete”). Estimated Costs to Complete include direct labor, equipment and subcontracting costs. Due to the nature of the efforts required to be performed to meet the underlying performance obligation, determining Estimated Costs to Complete may be complex and subject to many variables. We have a standard and disciplined process in which management reviews the progress and performance of open contracts in order to determine the best estimate of Estimated Costs to Complete. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion, the project schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of costs. The risks and opportunities include management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the project schedule, technical requirements, and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor costs, inclusive of subcontractors, and the cost of materials, among other variables. Based on this analysis, any adjustment to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recorded as necessary in the period they become known. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nRetirement Benefits\nOur benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs (benefits) associated with our domestic noncontributory pension plans (“U.S. Pension Benefit Plans”), our foreign noncontributory pension plans (“Non-U.S. Plans”), as well as our domestic postretirement health care plan (“Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan”), are determined using actuarial assumptions. The assumptions are based on management’s best estimates, after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries.\nAccounting methodologies use an attribution approach that generally spreads the effects of individual events over the service lives of the participants in the plan, or estimated average lifetime when almost all of the plan participants are considered \"inactive.\" Examples of “events” are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increases. As such, depending on the specific plan, we amortize gains and losses over periods ranging from eight to twenty-five years. Prior service costs are being amortized over periods ranging from one to fifteen years. Benefits under all pension plans are valued based on the projected unit credit cost method.\nThere are various assumptions used in calculating the net periodic costs (benefits) and related benefit obligations. One of these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns. We use a five-year, market-related asset value method of recognizing asset related gains and losses.\n52\nWe use long-term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plans’ assets, as well as future estimates of long-term investment returns, to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost (benefit) and the net postretirement health care benefit. Our investment return assumption for the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans was 7.74% in 2024 and 7.87% in 2023. Our investment return assumption for the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan was 8.30% in 2024 and 8.00% in 2023. Our weighted average investment return assumption for the Non-U.S. Plans was 5.84% in 2024 and 6.18% in 2023. For the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans, a 25 bps increase in expected return on plan assets would result in $10 million of additional net periodic pension benefit and a 25 bps decrease would result in a $10 million reduction in net periodic pension benefit in 2024. For the Non-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans, a 25 bps increase in expected return on plan assets would result in $4 million of additional net periodic pension benefit and a 25 bps decrease would result in a $4 million reduction in net periodic pension benefit in 2024. For the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan, a change in expected return on plan assets would have a de minimis impact to net periodic pension benefit in 2024.\nA second key assumption is the discount rate. The discount rate assumptions used for the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans, the Non-U.S. Plans and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan reflect, at December 31 of each year, the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. Our discount rates for measuring our U.S. Pension Benefit Plan obligations were 5.70% and 5.01% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our weighted average discount rates for measuring our Non-U.S. Plans were 5.07% and 4.3% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our discount rates for measuring the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan obligation were 5.49% and 4.92% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans, a 25 bps increase in the discount rate on the projected benefit obligation would result in a $109 million reduction of the projected benefit obligation and a 25 bps decrease would result in $115 million of additional projected benefit obligation in 2024. For the Non-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan, a 25 bps change in our discount rate would be de minimis in 2024.\nValuation and Recoverability of Goodwill\nWe assess the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis as of the last day of the third quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is assessed more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We continually assess whether any such events and circumstances have occurred, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such events and circumstances may include: (i) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, (ii) adverse changes in the industry or market in which we transact, (iii) changes in cost factors negatively impacting earnings and cash flows, (iv) negative or declining overall financial performance, (v) events affecting the carrying value or composition of a reporting unit, or (vi) a sustained decrease in share price, among others. Any such adverse event or change in circumstances could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe goodwill impairment assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An operating segment is deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. Based on this guidance, we have determined that our Products and Systems Integration and Software and Services segments are comprised of three and two reporting units, respectively.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amount for the fiscal years 2024 and 2023. In performing this qualitative assessment we assessed relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in enterprise value and entity-specific events. For fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we concluded it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management makes assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current and deferred tax provision and also the deferred tax assets and liabilities. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are required based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates for computing the income tax provision takes into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax law and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of certain audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial statements.\n53\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II.
