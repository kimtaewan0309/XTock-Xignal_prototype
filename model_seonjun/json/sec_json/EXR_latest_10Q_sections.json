We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-Q entitled “\nStatement on Forward-Looking Information\n.”\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and the audited financial statements contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 describe the significant accounting policies essential to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Preparation of our financial statements requires estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions that we have used are appropriate and correct based on information available at the time they were made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect our reported assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the period presented. If there are material differences between these estimates, judgments and assumptions and actual facts, our financial statements may be affected.\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require our judgment in its application. There are areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result, but there are some areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would produce a materially different result. See the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”), formed to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop self-storage properties (“stores”). We derive substantially all of our revenues from our two segments: self-storage operations and tenant reinsurance. Primary sources of revenue for our self-storage operations segment include rents received from tenants under leases at stores that are wholly-owned and in consolidated joint ventures. Our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. Consequently, management spends a significant portion of their time maximizing cash flows from our diverse portfolio of stores. Revenue from our tenant reinsurance segment consists of insurance revenues from the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores. \nOur stores are generally situated in highly visible locations clustered around large population centers. The clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. To maximize the performance of our stores, we employ industry-leading revenue management systems. Developed by our management team, these systems enable us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates daily across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions. We believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues.\nWe operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact, our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. We believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industry-leading technology systems. We consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80% or more for one calendar year.\n29\nPROPERTIES\nAs of September 30, 2025, we owned or had ownership interests in 2,427 operating stores. Of these stores, 2,005 are wholly-owned, 11 are in consolidated joint ventures, and 411 are in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional 1,811 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own and/or manage to 4,238. These stores are located in 43 states and Washington, D.C. The majority of our stores are clustered around large population centers. The clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. Our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence.\nAs of September 30, 2025, approximately 2,460,000 tenants were leasing storage units at the operating stores that we own and/or manage, primarily on a month-to-month basis, providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually, for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends. Although leases are short-term in duration, the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time. For same-stores as of September 30, 2025, the average length of stay for tenants who have vacated was approximately 17.0 months.\nOur store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations. Most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” stores, a mix of drive-up and multi-floor buildings. \n30\nThe following table presents additional information regarding net rentable square feet and the

\nOverview\nResults for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 included the operations of 2,427 stores (2,005 wholly-owned, 11 in consolidated joint ventures, and 411 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included the operations of 2,401 stores (1,934 wholly-owned, seven in consolidated joint ventures, and 460 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method).\nRevenues\nThe following table presents information on revenues earned for the periods indicated:\nFor

ended September 30, 2025 was primarily the result of an increase of $32,063 and $78,672, respectively, associated with acquisitions completed in 2024 and acquisitions completed in the first nine months of 2025. The increase in revenue resulting from these acquisitions was partially offset by decreases in rental revenue of $5,882 and $15,601, respectively, due to property dispositions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. We acquired 58 wholly-owned stores and disposed of six wholly-owned stores in 2024, and we acquired 46 wholly-owned stores and disposed of 12 wholly-owned stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nTenant reinsurance—\nThe increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of stores operated. We operated 4,238 stores at September 30, 2025 compared to 3,862 stores at September 30, 2024.\nManagement fees and other income—\nManagement fees and other income primarily represent the fees collected for our management of stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures and other transaction fee income. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was due to both an increase in the number of stores managed and an increase in the overall revenue of stores under management when compared to the same period last year. As of September 30, 2025, we managed 2,222 stores for unconsolidated joint ventures and third parties, compared to 1,921 stores as of September 30, 2024.   \nExpenses\nThe following table presents information on expenses for the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nExpenses:\nProperty operations\n$\n235,486 \n$\n209,035 \n$\n26,451 \n12.7 \n%\n$\n686,689 \n$\n610,455 \n$\n76,234 \n12.5 \n%\nTenant reinsurance \n17,781 \n17,510 \n271 \n1.5 \n%\n51,842 \n55,646 \n(3,804)\n(6.8)\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n43,479 \n39,750 \n3,729 \n9.4 \n%\n134,405 \n123,373 \n11,032 \n8.9 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n177,466 \n195,046 \n(17,580)\n(9.0)\n%\n535,088 \n586,821 \n(51,733)\n(8.8)\n%\nTotal expenses\n$\n474,212 \n$\n461,341 \n$\n12,871 \n2.8 \n%\n$\n1,408,024 \n$\n1,376,295 \n$\n31,729 \n2.3 \n%\n32\nProperty operations—\nThe increase in property operations expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 consists primarily of an increase of $14,738 and $38,855, respectively, related to acquisitions completed in 2024 and acquisitions completed in the first nine months of 2025. We acquired 58 wholly-owned stores in 2024 and an additional 46 wholly-owned stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, there was an increase of $9,184 and $31,215, respectively, at our same-store properties primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits, marketing, repairs and maintenance, and property tax expenses.\nTenant reinsurance—\nTenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance and is subject to volatility due to increased claims arising when significant events occur at stores.\nGeneral and administrative—\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, office expense, office rent, travel and professional fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred. Our overall general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of our increased size through acquisitions and growth in our managed portfolio.\nDepreciation and amortization—\nWe amortize to expense intangible assets-customer intangibles on a straight-line basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility (currently estimated at 18 months). Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to the customer intangibles associated with our merger with Life Storage being fully expensed in January of this year. \nOther Revenues and Expenses\nThe following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nLoss on real estate assets held for sale and sold, net\n$\n(105,128)\n$\n(8,961)\n$\n(96,167)\n1,073.2 \n%\n$\n(70,231)\n$\n(63,620)\n$\n(6,611)\n10.4 \n%\nInterest expense\n(149,650)\n(142,855)\n(6,795)\n4.8 \n%\n(438,177)\n(412,875)\n(25,302)\n6.1 \n%\nNon-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on unsecured senior notes, net\n(12,086)\n(11,005)\n(1,081)\n9.8 \n%\n(35,169)\n(32,563)\n(2,606)\n8.0 \n%\nInterest income\n43,588 \n34,947 \n8,641 \n24.7 \n%\n124,553 \n89,746 \n34,807 \n38.8 \n%\nEquity in earnings and dividend income from unconsolidated real estate entities\n15,669 \n16,246 \n(577)\n(3.6)\n%\n51,884 \n48,508 \n3,376 \n7.0 \n%\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and sale of a joint venture interest\n9,354 \n13,730 \n(4,376)\n(31.9)\n%\n9,354 \n13,730 \n(4,376)\n(31.9)\n%\nImpairment of Life Storage trade name\n— \n(51,763)\n51,763 \n(100.0)\n%\n— \n(51,763)\n51,763 \n(100.0)\n%\nIncome tax expense\n(11,962)\n(10,857)\n(1,105)\n10.2 \n%\n(32,591)\n(27,443)\n(5,148)\n18.8 \n%\nTotal other revenues & expenses, net\n$\n(210,215)\n$\n(160,518)\n$\n(49,697)\n31.0 \n%\n$\n(390,377)\n$\n(436,280)\n$\n45,903 \n(10.5)\n%\nLoss on real estate assets held for sale and sold, net—\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had 29 properties classified as held for sale. Of the 29 stores, 27 had an estimated fair value, net of selling costs, less than the carrying value of the assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recorded estimated net losses of $105,128 and $108,887, respectively. Additionally, we completed the sale of 12 previously held for sale stores, resulting in a net gain of $38,656, which partially offset the loss recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had 17 stores classified as held for sale. Of the 17 stores, nine had an estimated fair value, net of selling costs, less than the carrying value of the assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded estimated losses of $8,961 and $63,620, respectively.\n33\nInterest expense—\nThe increase in interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily the result of higher outstanding debt. As of September 30, 2025, we had approximately $13,162,058 in total face value of debt, compared to approximately $11,827,208 as of September 30, 2024. \nNon-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on unsecured senior notes, net—\nRepresents the amortization of the discount assigned to the fair value of the Life Storage unsecured senior notes assumed as part of the Life Storage Merger and net premium from bond offerings, offset by the discount from assumed debt.\nInterest income—\nInterest income represents interest earned on variable interest rate bridge loans, debt securities and on notes receivable from Common Operating Partnership unit holders. The increase in interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily the result of an increase in the amount of bridge loans outstanding. The balance of bridge loans was $1,544,719 as of September 30, 2025, compared to $1,032,244 as of September 30, 2024.\nEquity in earnings and dividend income from unconsolidated real estate entities—\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. In these joint ventures, we and our joint venture partners generally receive a preferred return on our invested capital. To the extent that cash or profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated, we receive a higher percentage of the excess cash or profits. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 is primarily due to the transaction in November 2024 in which we acquired additional ownership interest in the HF1 Sovran HHF Storage Holdings LLC and HF2 Sovran HHF Storage Holdings II LLC from our partner in the unconsolidated joint ventures. The transaction increased our equity ownership percentages from 20% and 15%, respectively, to 49% in each unconsolidated joint venture. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2025 is primarily due to the transfer and distribution of membership interests in the PR II EXR JV LLC joint venture in March 2025, the acquisition of our partners’ membership interests in the ESS-NYFL JV LP and ESS CA-TIVS JV LP joint ventures in April 2025, and the sale of our membership interest in the Life Storage Spacemax LLC joint venture in July 2025. The number of stores in unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have ownership interests was 411 as of September 30, 2025, compared to 460 as of September 30, 2024. Dividend income represents dividends from our investment in preferred stock of SmartStop and its affiliates.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and sale of a joint venture interest\n—The net gain of $9,354 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 is due to the sale of our membership interest in the Life Storage Spacemax LLC joint venture, which held six properties, in July 2025. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the ESS Bristol Investments LLC joint venture sold five of its eight stores to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, and we recognized a gain of $10,324 for our pro rata share of the transaction. Additionally, we sold our membership interest in the Alan Jathoo JV LLC unconsolidated joint venture, which held nine stores, to our partner and recognized a gain of $3,406 as a result of the transaction.\nImpairment of Life Storage trade name\n—During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we decided to operate all our stores under a single brand. As a result of that decision, we deemed the Life Storage trade name as an intangible asset to be impaired and recognized a loss for the full value of the asset.\nIncome tax expense\n—The increase in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily the result of an increase in book income and a decrease in permanent tax deductions related to stock awards.\nFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS\nFunds from operations (“FFO”) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. Net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions, and we believe FFO more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be \n34\nconsidered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions.\nThe following table presents the calculation of FFO for the periods indicated:\n \nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n165,998 \n$\n193,210 \n$\n686,604 \n$\n592,194 \nAdjustments:\nReal estate depreciation\n164,834 \n154,573 \n488,711 \n462,162 \nAmortization of intangibles\n3,037 \n28,160 \n17,341 \n85,581 \nLoss on real estate assets held for sale and sold, net\n105,128 \n8,961 \n70,231 \n63,620 \nUnconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization\n7,466 \n7,922 \n23,896 \n23,771 \nUnconsolidated joint venture gain on sale of real estate assets\n(9,354)\n(13,730)\n(9,354)\n(13,730)\nIncome allocated to Operating Partnership noncontrolling interests \n8,035 \n9,735 \n35,070 \n30,237 \nFunds from operations attributable to common stockholders and unit holders\n$\n445,144 \n$\n388,831 \n$\n1,312,499 \n$\n1,243,835 \n35\nSAME-STORE RESULTS\nOur same-store pool for the periods presented consists of 1,829 stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80% or more for one calendar year. We believe that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including but not limited to occupancy, rental revenue growth, operating expense growth, net operating income growth, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole.

Cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to our acquisition and development of new stores, sales of stores, investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, and notes receivable from bridge loans and fluctuate depending on our actions in those areas. Cash flows from financing activities depend primarily on our debt and equity financing activities. A summary of cash flows along with significant components are as follows:\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,482,396 \n$\n1,479,151 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(697,662)\n(877,503)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(811,803)\n(612,406)\nSignificant components of net cash flow included:\nNet income\n$\n721,674 \n$\n622,431 \nDepreciation and amortization\n535,088 \n586,821 \nAcquisition and development of real estate assets\n(698,614)\n(461,633)\nProceeds from sale of real estate assets\n168,747 \n4,415 \nInvestment in unconsolidated real estate entities\n(107,178)\n(7,175)\nReturn of investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures\n231,130 \n12,999 \nIssuance of notes receivable, net of sales and principal payments\n(276,043)\n(410,396)\nNet proceeds (payments) from unsecured term loans, senior notes, revolving lines of credit and commercial paper\n(1,344,259)\n(520,534)\nProceeds from issuance of public bonds, net\n1,650,000 \n1,000,000 \nDividends paid on common stock\n(1,031,930)\n(1,031,044)\nWe believe that cash flows generated by operations, along with our existing cash and cash equivalents, the availability of funds under our existing lines of credit, and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months. These cash needs include operating expenses, monthly debt service payments, acquisitions, funding for the bridge loan program, recurring capital expenditures, building redevelopments and expansions, distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification.\nWe expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2025, and we consider projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds under our existing lines of credit, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $111,931 available in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. During 2025 and 2024, we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nThe following table presents information relating to our debt:\nSeptember 30, 2025\nTotal face value of debt\n$\n13,162,058\nTotal enterprise value ratio\n29.6 \n%\nTotal fixed-rate debt and other instruments to total debt\n83.8% \n(1)\nWeighted average interest rate of total debt\n4.4 \n%\n(1) $11,025,665 total fixed-rate debt including $952,000 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt.\n38\nWe expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of Operating Partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit and commercial paper. In addition, we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs and growth assumptions.\nIn November 2024, we established our commercial paper program, under which we may issue, repay and re-issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the program at any time cannot exceed $1,000,000, and the net proceeds of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the notes generally range from overnight to three months, with a maximum of up to 13 months. The commercial paper notes are issued under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, can be issued at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. At any point in time, we expect to maintain available commitments under our Credit Facilities in an amount at least equal to the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding. At September 30, 2025, we had $540,000 in issuances outstanding under the commercial paper program. \nWe hold a BBB+/Stable rating from S&P, which was upgraded from BBB/Stable in July 2023 in connection with the Life Storage Merger, and a Baa2/Positive rating from Moody’s Investors Service. We intend to manage our balance sheet to maintain these ratings. Certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. As of September 30, 2025, we had a total of 1,786 unencumbered stores as defined by our public bonds. Our unencumbered asset value was calculated as $30,315,349 and our total asset value was calculated as $35,717,864 according to the calculations as defined by our public bonds. We are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at September 30, 2025.\nOur liquidity needs consist primarily of operating expenses, monthly debt service payments, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders and distributions to unit holders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. We may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. We may also use Operating Partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners. \nOn April 15, 2024, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with certain sales agents and forward purchasers named therein. Under the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, we may issue and sell, and the forward purchasers may sell, from time to time through or to the sales agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $800,000. The shares of common stock will be offered pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-278690) previously filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, filed with the SEC. As of September 30, 2025, no shares have been sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement, which we refer to as our “at the market” equity program.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nExcept as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities, nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nSEASONALITY\nThe self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits is typically realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nRECENT TAX LEGISLATION\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”) was enacted into law, which included certain modifications to U.S. tax law, including certain provisions that affect the taxation of REITs and their investors. The OBBBA permanently extended certain provisions that were enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Such extensions included the \n39\npermanent extension of the 20% deduction for “qualified REIT dividends” for individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers. The OBBBA also increased the percentage limit under the REIT asset test applicable to taxable REIT subsidiaries (the permissible value of taxable REIT subsidiary securities that a REIT may hold) from 20% to 25% of the value of the REIT’s total assets for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the provisions of the OBBBA, but we do not expect the OBBBA to have a material impact on our financial position and/or results of operations.\n40"
