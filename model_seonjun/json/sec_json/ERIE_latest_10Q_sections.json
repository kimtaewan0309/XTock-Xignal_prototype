Our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange, as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.\nThe Exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another.  Each applicant for insurance (a subscriber) to the Exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of Indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the Exchange on their behalf.  In accordance with the subscriber’s agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we retain a management fee calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.\nOur earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  The policy issuance and renewal services we provide are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies.  The sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services.  Agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as incentive compensation, which is earned by achieving targeted measures.  Agent compensation generally comprises approximately two-thirds of our policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing.  The remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support.  We also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.\nConsistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions.  Life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business.  Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds.  In 2024, approximately 70% of the administrative services expenses were entirely attributable to the respective administrative functions (claims handling, life insurance management and investment management), while the remaining 30% of these expenses were allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions.  The expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity.  Reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.\nOur results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the Exchange as the Exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by \n27\nTable of Contents\nthe Exchange.  The Exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 71% of the 2024 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 29%.  The principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  The principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.\nInformation security incident\nOn June 7, 2025, we identified unusual network activity, which we determined to be the result of an information security incident.  Upon learning of this activity, we activated our incident response protocols and took immediate action to respond to the situation to safeguard our systems and data, including collaboration with law enforcement and leading cybersecurity experts.  After a thorough forensics investigation conducted by independent cybersecurity specialists, there was no evidence that any sensitive personal information, financial records or legally protected data was breached by the threat actor during this incident.  We resumed full business operations as of July 7, 2025, with key services and systems safely and securely restored.  \nBetween the outset of the incident and return to full business operations, we incurred certain disruptions to our business operations, primarily related to the ability to process premium activity for the Exchange, which impacts our management fee revenue.\n \nAdditionally, we have incurred and will continue to incur certain expenses related to the information security incident, including expenses to respond to, remediate and investigate this matter.  We have cybersecurity insurance that we expect will cover a portion of lost income due to business interruption and related expenses.  The full impact has not yet been determined, but is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFinancial Overview\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nOperating income\n$\n208,921 \n$\n180,125 \n16.0 \n%\n$\n559,470 \n$\n509,145 \n9.9 \n%\nTotal investment income\n21,554 \n19,549 \n10.3 \n60,690 \n48,455 \n25.2 \nOther income\n2,286 \n1,168 \n95.7 \n8,094 \n7,871 \n2.8 \nIncome before income taxes\n232,761 \n200,842 \n15.9 \n628,254 \n565,471 \n11.1 \nIncome tax expense\n49,908 \n41,012 \n21.7 \n132,299 \n117,186 \n12.9 \nNet income\n$\n182,853 \n$\n159,830 \n14.4 \n%\n$\n495,955 \n$\n448,285 \n10.6 \n%\nNet income per share – diluted\n$\n3.50 \n$\n3.06 \n14.4 \n%\n$\n9.48 \n$\n8.57 \n10.6 \n%\nOperating income increased in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, as growth in operating revenue outpaced the growth in operating expenses.  Management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased 7.3% to $825.3 million in the third quarter of 2025 and 9.5% to $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.  Management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge and the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The management fee rate was 25% for both 2025 and 2024.  The direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange increased 7.6% to $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2025 and 10.1% to $9.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024.\nCost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 4.7% to $642.1 million in the third quarter of 2025 and 9.1% to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth and increased agent incentive compensation due to improved profitability.  Cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services in the third quarter of 2025 were partially offset by decreased personnel costs related to incentive compensation.\nManagement fee revenue for administrative services increased 9.8% to $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2025 and 7.1% to $54.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024.  The administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by $215.7 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $638.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, but had no net impact on operating income.\nTotal investment income increased $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024.  The results from both periods were primarily due to an increase in net investment income.  \n28\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Conditions and Trends Affecting Our Business\nEconomic conditions\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the Exchange’s customers to modify coverage, not renew policies or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the Exchange, and consequently our management fee revenue.  Elevated inflation, supply chain disruptions or changes in tariff policies could impact the Exchange's operations and our management fees.  In particular, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, building material cost inflation, auto repair and replacement cost inflation and social inflation may impact adequacy of estimated loss reserves and future premium rates of the Exchange.  If any of these items impacted the financial condition or operations of the Exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results.  For a discussion of the potential impacts to our operations or those of the Exchange, see Financial Condition and Liquidity and Capital Resources contained within this report, as well as Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and Part II. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2025 and August 7, 2025, respectively.\nFinancial market volatility\nOur portfolio of available-for-sale and equity security investments is subject to market volatility, especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets.  Net investment income is impacted by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations.  Depending upon market conditions, considerable fluctuation could occur in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Various ongoing geopolitical events, the uncertain tariff, inflationary and interest rate environment and a potential economic slowdown could have a significant impact on the global financial markets with the potential for future losses and/or impairments on our investment portfolio. \n29\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nManagement fee revenue\nWe have two performance obligations in the subscriber’s agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange, as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services.  We retain management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange in these two capacities, and allocate our revenues between our performance obligations.  \nThe management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our Board of Directors at least annually.  The management fee rate was set at 25% for both 2025 and 2024.  Changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly.  The transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative services reimbursement revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services.  We update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price.  Our current transaction price allocation review resulted in a minor change in the allocation between the two performance obligations in 2025 compared to 2024, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents the allocation and disaggregation of revenue for our two performance obligations:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nPolicy issuance and renewal services\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange\n$\n3,402,438 \n$\n3,162,302 \n7.6 \n%\n$\n9,947,314 \n$\n9,038,508 \n10.1 \n%\nManagement fee rate\n24.37 \n%\n24.40 \n%\n24.37 \n%\n24.40 \n%\nManagement fee revenue\n829,174 \n771,602 \n7.5 \n2,424,160 \n2,205,396 \n9.9 \nChange in estimate for management fee returned on cancelled policies \n(1)\n(3,899)\n(2,440)\n(59.8)\n(19,983)\n(9,662)\nNM\nManagement fee revenue - policy issuance and renewal services\n$\n825,275 \n$\n769,162 \n7.3 \n%\n$\n2,404,177 \n$\n2,195,734 \n9.5 \n%\nAdministrative services\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange\n$\n3,402,438 \n$\n3,162,302 \n7.6 \n%\n$\n9,947,314 \n$\n9,038,508 \n10.1 \n%\nManagement fee rate\n0.63 \n%\n0.60 \n%\n0.63 \n%\n0.60 \n%\nManagement fee revenue\n21,435 \n18,974 \n13.0 \n62,668 \n54,231 \n15.6 \nChange in contract liability \n(2)\n(2,510)\n(1,796)\n(39.8)\n(7,694)\n(3,045)\nNM\nChange in estimate for management fee returned on cancelled policies \n(1)\n(94)\n(24)\nNM\n(202)\n(47)\nNM\nManagement fee revenue - administrative services\n18,831 \n17,154 \n9.8 \n54,772 \n51,139 \n7.1 \nAdministrative services reimbursement revenue\n215,694 \n206,754 \n4.3 \n638,611 \n604,349 \n5.7 \nTotal revenue from administrative services\n$\n234,525 \n$\n223,908 \n4.7 \n%\n$\n693,383 \n$\n655,488 \n5.8 \n%\n \nNM = not meaningful\n(1)\nA constraining estimate of variable consideration exists related to the potential for management fees to be returned if a policy were to be cancelled mid-term.

See Part I, Item 1. \"Financial Statements - Note 3, Revenue, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report.\n30\nTable of Contents\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the Exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries.  Direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange increased 7.6% to $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased personal lines and commercial multi-peril premiums written.  Year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 0.2% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 6.0% in the third quarter of 2024.  The year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 10.7% at September 30, 2025 compared to 12.8% at September 30, 2024.  \nPremiums generated from new business decreased 20.5% to $351 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by decreased premiums written in the personal auto, commercial multi-peril and homeowners lines.  Contributing to this change was a 24.1% decrease in new business policies written, partially offset by a 8.5% increase in year-over-year average premium per policy on new business at September 30, 2025.  Premiums generated from new business increased 9.5% to $441 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by increased premiums written in the commercial multi-peril and homeowners lines.  Contributing to this change was a 15.9% increase in year-over-year average premium per policy on new business, somewhat offset by a 4.0% decrease in new business policies written in the third quarter of 2024. \nPremiums generated from renewal business increased 12.1% to $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 and increased 20.0% to $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.  Underlying the trend in renewal business premiums in both periods was an 11.3% increase in year-over-year average premium per policy at September 30, 2025, and 12.3% at September 30, 2024, as well as an increase in year-over-year policies in force of 4.1% and 5.7% in the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nPersonal lines\n – Total personal lines premiums written increased 7.1% to $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 20.1% in the third quarter of 2024, driven by a 11.1% increase in total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy, slightly offset by a 0.2% decrease in total personal lines policies in force. \nCommercial lines\n – Total commercial lines premiums written increased 8.9% to $902 million in the third quarter of 2025,  compared to 13.9% in the third quarter of 2024, driven by a 7.9% increase in total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 3.0% increase in total commercial lines policies in force.\nFuture trends-premium revenue\n – Through a careful agency selection and monitoring process, the Exchange plans to continue efforts to utilize its agency force to increase market penetration in existing operating territories to contribute to future growth.  \nPremium levels impacted by changes in policies in force and rate actions affect the profitability of the Exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee revenue.  Future rate actions could be impacted by potential changes in regulation, inflationary trends and tariff policies, among others.  As the Exchange writes policies almost exclusively with annual terms, premium rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premiums, or longer for policies with a rate locking feature.

The estimated agent incentive payouts at September 30, 2025 are based on actual underwriting results for the two prior years and current year-to-date actual results and forecasted results for the remainder of 2025.  The profitability component of agent incentive compensation increased due to improved actual and forecasted loss ratios for the three-year period ended 2025 compared to the three-year period ended 2024.\nNon-commission expense\n – Non-commission expense decreased $11.9 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024.  Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $1.6 million primarily due to increased postage costs, partially offset by a decrease in underwriting report costs.  Sales and advertising expense decreased $4.4 million primarily due to decreased agent-related costs and costs from community development initiatives.  Administrative and other costs decreased $11.5 million primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and professional fees.  \n32\nTable of Contents\nNon-commission expense increased $15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.  Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $5.9 million primarily due to increased postage and personnel costs.  Information technology costs increased $19.8 million primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and hardware and software costs.  Customer service costs increased $3.5 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and credit card processing fees.  Administrative and other costs decreased $12.9 million primarily due to decreased personnel costs.  \nPersonnel costs in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were impacted by decreased incentive compensation compared to 2024.  Decreases in incentive plan costs in both periods were primarily driven by lower performance metrics compared to 2024 and a decrease in company stock price during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to an increase during the respective periods in 2024.  Personnel costs in all expense categories for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were also impacted by increased healthcare costs compared to 2024.\nAdministrative services\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nManagement fee revenue - administrative services\n$\n18,831\n$\n17,154\n9.8 \n%\n$\n54,772\n$\n51,139\n7.1 \n%\nAdministrative services reimbursement revenue\n215,694\n206,754\n4.3 \n638,611\n604,349\n5.7 \nTotal revenue allocated to administrative services\n234,525\n223,908\n4.7 \n693,383\n655,488\n5.8 \nAdministrative services expenses\nClaims handling services\n189,947\n179,526\n5.8 \n562,407\n511,813\n9.9 \nInvestment management services\n7,560\n9,718\n(22.2)\n24,598\n27,363\n(10.1)\nLife management services\n18,187\n17,510\n3.9 \n51,606\n65,173\n(20.8)\nOperating income - administrative services\n$\n18,831\n$\n17,154\n9.8 \n%\n$\n54,772\n$\n51,139\n7.1 \n%\nAdministrative services\nThe management fee revenue allocated to administrative services was 0.63% and 0.60% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.  This portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue over a four-year period representing the time over which the services are provided.  We also report reimbursed costs as revenues, which are recognized monthly as services are provided.  The administrative services expenses we incur and the related reimbursements we receive are recorded gross in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCost of administrative services\nConsistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at Exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity.  Reimbursements due from the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries are recorded as a receivable and settled at cost.\n33\nTable of Contents\nTotal investment income\nA summary of the results of our investment operations is as follows:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nNet investment income\n$\n21,033 \n$\n17,322 \n21.4 \n%\n$\n61,011 \n$\n49,235 \n23.9 \n%\nNet realized and unrealized investment gains\n1,331 \n2,925 \n(54.5)\n2,312 \n2,983 \n(22.5)\nNet impairment losses recognized in earnings\n(810)\n(698)\n(16.1)\n(2,633)\n(3,763)\n30.0 \nTotal investment income\n$\n21,554 \n$\n19,549 \n10.3 \n%\n$\n60,690 \n$\n48,455 \n25.2 \n%\nNet investment income\nNet investment income includes interest and dividends on our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios and the results of our limited partnership investments, net of investment expenses.  Net investment income increased $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024.  The increase in both periods was primarily due to an increase in bond and cash and cash equivalent income driven by higher average holdings and bond yields, an increase in agent loan interest income, and higher equity in earnings of limited partnerships.  Net investment income included limited partnership earnings of $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to losses of $0.1 million for the same period in 2024, and $1.3 million of limited partnership earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2024.\nNet realized and unrealized investment gains\nA breakdown of our net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) is as follows:\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nSecurities sold:\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nAvailable-for-sale securities\n$\n571 \n$\n142 \n$\n(122)\n$\n(2,495)\nEquity securities\n66 \n146 \n340 \n883 \nChange in fair value on remaining equity securities\n694 \n2,636 \n2,089 \n4,594 \nMiscellaneous\n0 \n1 \n5 \n1 \nNet realized and unrealized investment gains\n$\n1,331 \n$\n2,925 \n$\n2,312 \n$\n2,983 \nNet realized and unrealized gains of $1.3 million during the third quarter of 2025 and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were primarily due to market value adjustments on equity securities and net gains on disposals of securities.  Net realized and unrealized gains of $2.9 million during the third quarter of 2024 were primarily due to market value adjustments on equity securities.  Net realized and unrealized gains of $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to market value adjustments on equity securities, partially offset by losses on disposals of available-for-sale securities.\nNet impairment losses recognized in earnings\nNet impairment losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 included both credit-related and intent to sell impairments on available-for-sale securities as well as current expected credit losses on agent loans and other loans receivable.  The nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included current expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition of Erie Insurance Exchange\nServing in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the Exchange, who is our sole customer.  The strength of the Exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by AM Best through assessing its financial stability and ability to pay claims.  The ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors.  On September 5, 2025, the Exchange and each of its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries were downgraded from A+ \"Superior\" to A \"Excellent\" and our financial strength rating was revised from negative to stable.  The A \"Excellent\" rating is the third highest financial strength rating assigned to companies that have achieved excellent overall performance when compared to the standards established by AM Best and have an excellent ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term.  While the Exchange's policyholder surplus continues to be classified in AM Best's strongest category, the downgrade was primarily driven by the Exchange’s large underwriting losses in each of the last three years, driven by elevated weather-related events and increased severity in the auto and homeowners’ segments.  The stable financial strength rating reflects the expectation that the Exchange's profitability initiatives will accelerate and stabilize operating results over the near term.  Furthermore, the stable outlook reflects the strongest level of balance sheet strength as assessed by AM Best.\nThe financial statements of the Exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Statutory direct written premiums of the Exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries grew 10.1% to $9.9 billion in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the first nine months of 2024.  These premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the Exchange.  Policyholders’ surplus determined under statutory accounting principles was $9.6 billion and $9.3 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.  The Exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 89.1% at September 30, 2025 and 90.4% at December 31, 2024.\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements considering the financial strength of the Exchange based on its AM Best rating and strong level of surplus.

Our available-for-sale portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk. \nAvailable-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders’ equity.  Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of deferred taxes, totaled $0.5 million at September 30, 2025, compared to unrealized losses of $17.6 million at December 31, 2024.  \nThe following table presents a breakdown of the fair value of our available-for-sale portfolio by industry sector and rating as of:\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2025 \n(1)\nAAA\nAA\nA\nBBB\nNon- investment\ngrade\nFair\nvalue\n (Unaudited)\nBasic materials\n$\n0 \n$\n0 \n$\n2,514 \n$\n0 \n$\n8,077 \n$\n10,591 \nCommunications\n0 \n5,057 \n13,633 \n10,800 \n13,395 \n42,885 \nConsumer\n0 \n4,031 \n38,405 \n55,894 \n37,265 \n135,595 \nDiversified\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n900 \n900 \nEnergy\n0 \n899 \n5,864 \n23,836 \n15,052 \n45,651 \nFinancial\n0 \n2,248 \n118,543 \n138,265 \n15,555 \n274,611 \nIndustrial\n0 \n0 \n7,817 \n20,770 \n30,175 \n58,762 \nStructured securities \n(2)\n161,736 \n180,921 \n20,534 \n15,310 \n1,253 \n379,754 \nTechnology\n1,976 \n0 \n0 \n17,519 \n11,760 \n31,255 \nU.S. Treasury\n0 \n7,370 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n7,370 \nUtilities\n0 \n0 \n13,782 \n48,548 \n16,129 \n78,459 \nTotal\n$\n163,712 \n$\n200,526 \n$\n221,092 \n$\n330,942 \n$\n149,561 \n$\n1,065,833 \n(1)\nRatings are supplied by S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch.  The table is based upon the lowest rating for each security.\n(2)\nStructured securities include residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and asset-backed securities.\n \n36\nTable of Contents\n \nEquity securities\nEquity securities primarily include nonredeemable preferred stocks and are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position with all changes in unrealized gains and losses reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe following table presents an analysis of the fair value of our equity securities by sector as of:\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nFinancial services\n$\n60,425 \n$\n69,930 \nUtilities\n3,534 \n5,629 \nEnergy\n1,988 \n4,117 \nConsumer\n4,558 \n3,341 \nTechnology\n3,224 \n1,974 \nCommunications\n963 \n900 \nTotal \n$\n74,692 \n$\n85,891 \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe continue to monitor the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources given the potential impact of current economic conditions, including the uncertain tariff, inflationary and interest rate environment.  While we did not see a significant impact on our sources or uses of cash in the third quarter of 2025, future market disruptions could occur which may affect our liquidity position.  If our normal operating and investing cash activities were to become insufficient to meet future funding requirements, we believe we have sufficient access to liquidity through our cash position, diverse liquid marketable securities and our $100 million bank revolving line of credit that does not expire until November 2029.  See broader discussions of potential risks to our operations in \"Operating Overview\" contained within this report and Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and Part II. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2025 and August 7, 2025, respectively.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nLiquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  Our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  Cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, the purchase and development of information technology, and other capital expenditures.  See Part I, Item 1. \"Financial Statements - Note 9, Postretirement Benefits, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report for the funding policy and related contribution for our defined benefit pension plan.  We expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations.  Cash in excess of our operating needs is primarily invested in investment grade fixed maturities.  As part of our liquidity review, we regularly evaluate our capital needs based on current and projected results and consider the potential impacts to our liquidity, borrowing capacity, financial covenants and capital availability.\nWe maintain relationships and cash balances at diversified and well-capitalized financial institutions and have established processes to monitor them.  We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our current and future cash requirements.\nVolatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we do occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  Some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, may be illiquid.  Additionally, if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements, or if we are required to return cash collateral in connection with our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, or be forced to sell at deep discounts.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from sources other than the liquidation of securities.\nOn May 1, 2025, we announced the formation of the Erie Insurance Foundation, a private charitable foundation that will create long-term sustainability for charitable contributions and grantmaking.  To launch the initiative and fund the foundation’s endowment, we announced our planned donation of $100 million, which we expect to fund in the next twelve months.\n37\nTable of Contents\nCash flow activities\nThe following table provides condensed cash flow information as follows for the nine months ended September 30:\n(in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n(Unaudited)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n515,100 \n$\n417,791 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(101,052)\n(170,406)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(143,894)\n(170,227)\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n270,154 \n$\n77,158 \n \nNet cash provided by operating activities was $515.1 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to $417.8 million for the same period in 2024.  Increased cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in management fees received of $255.8 million, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for agent commissions of $162.9 million, both driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  \nNet cash used in investing activities was $101.1 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to $170.4 million for the same period in 2024.  Decreased cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in purchases net of proceeds from sales and maturities/calls of available-for-sale securities of $56.6 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $143.9 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to $170.2 million for the same period in 2024.  Decreased cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increased cash collateral received related to increased lending of securities under our securities lending program.  This was partially offset by increased dividends paid to shareholders.  We increased both our Class A and Class B shareholder regular quarterly dividends by 7.1% for 2025, compared to 2024.  There are no regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to our shareholders.\nCapital Outlook\nWe regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events.  Should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.\nOutside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through: 1) unrestricted and unpledged cash and cash equivalents, which totaled approximately $540.3 million at September 30, 2025, 2) $100 million available bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unrestricted and unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including equity securities and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $803.1 million at September 30, 2025.  Volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  Additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.  See Part I, Item 1. \"Financial Statements - Note 8, Bank Line of Credit, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional information related to our bank revolving line of credit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees.  See Part I, Item 1. \"Financial Statements - Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional information.  We do not believe that these obligations will have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n38\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n \nWe make estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements.  The most significant estimates relate to investment valuation and retirement benefit plans for employees.  While management believes its estimates are appropriate, the ultimate amounts may differ from estimates provided.  Our most critical accounting estimates are described in Item 7. \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for the year ended December 31, 2024 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2025.  See Part I, Item 1. \"Financial Statements - Note 6, Fair Value, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional information on our valuation of investments."
