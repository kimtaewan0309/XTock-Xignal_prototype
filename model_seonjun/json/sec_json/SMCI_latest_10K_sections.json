This approach enhances communication and collaboration between our design teams, streamlining the development process and reducing time-to-market. We believe that the combination of our focus on internal research and development activities, our close working relationships with local customers and vendors and our modular design approach allows us to decrease time-to-market, improve quality and deliver superior product designs. Additionally, we continue to invest in reducing our design and manufacturing costs while improving the performance, cost-effectiveness and power- and space-efficiency of our Total IT Solutions.\nOur research and development teams focus on the development of new and enhanced products that can support emerging technological and engineering innovations while achieving high overall system performance. Much of our research and development activity relates to the new product cycles of leading processor vendors. We work closely with NVIDIA, Intel and AMD, among others, to develop products that are compatible with the latest generation of industry-standard technologies under development. Our collaborative approach with these vendors allows us to align the design of our new products with their product release schedules, thereby enhancing our ability to rapidly introduce new products incorporating the latest technology. We work closely with their respective development teams to enhance system performance and reduce system-level issues. Similarly, we work very closely with our customers to understand their needs and develop our new product plans accordingly.\nCustomers\nDuring each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we sold to over 1,000 customers in over 100 countries. In addition, over the three years ended June 30, 2025, we have sold to thousands of end users through our indirect sales channel. These customers represent a diverse set of market verticals including enterprise data centers, cloud computing, AI, 5G and edge computing markets. Four customers each accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal year 2025 and one single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal year 2024. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal year 2023.\nSales and Marketing \nOur sales and marketing activities are conducted through a combination of our direct sales force and our indirect sales channel partners. Our direct sales force is primarily focused on selling Total IT Solutions, including management software and global services, to large scale cloud, enterprise and OEM customers. In addition, we operate a centralized command center, designed to assist customers with quick and accurate configurations.\nWe work with distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, and OEMs to market and sell our optimized solutions to their end customers. We provide sales and marketing assistance and training to our indirect sales channel partners and OEMs. We leverage our relationships in our indirect sales channel and with OEMs to penetrate select industry vertical market segments where our products can provide better alternatives to existing solutions.\nWe maintain close contact with our indirect sales channel partners and end customers. We often collaborate during the sales process with our indirect sales channel partners and the end customer’s technical staff to determine the optimal system configuration for the customer’s needs. Our interaction with our indirect sales channel partners and end customers allows us to monitor customer requirements and develop new products to meet their needs.\nInternational Sales\nOur global sales efforts are supported both by our international offices in the Netherlands, Taiwan, South Korea, United Kingdom, China, and Japan, as well as by our United States based sales team. Product fulfillment and first level support for our international customers are provided by Supermicro Global Services, as well as through our indirect sales channel and OEMs. Sales to customers located outside of the United States represented 40.6%, 32.0%, and 32.1% of net sales in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 5\nTable of Contents\nMarketing\nOur marketing programs are designed to create global awareness and brand-recognition for our company and products, as well as an understanding of the significant value we bring to customers. These programs also inform existing and potential customers, the trade press, market analysts, indirect sales channel partners, and OEMs about the strong capabilities and benefits of using our products and solutions. Our marketing efforts support the sale and distribution of our products through both direct sales and indirect channels. We utilize a variety of marketing vehicles, including advertising, public relations, web, social media, collateral, and participation in industry events and tradeshows, to build market awareness and generate new customer demand. We provide cooperative marketing funds to our indirect sales channel partners to extend the reach of our marketing efforts. We also leverage our suppliers’ cooperative marketing programs to jointly benefit from their marketing development funds.\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property rights with a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and disclosure restrictions. We rely primarily on trade secrets, technical know-how, and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our design and product development activities. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, and other third parties and control access to our designs, documentation, and other proprietary information.\nManufacturing and Quality Control\nWe manufacture the majority of our systems at our San Jose, California headquarters. We believe we are the only major server, storage, and accelerated compute platform vendor that designs, develops, and manufactures a significant portion of their systems in the United States. Global assembly, test and quality control of our servers are performed at our manufacturing facilities in San Jose, California, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and Malaysia. In each of our existing facilities, a Quality and Environmental Management System has been certified according to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and/or ISO 13485 standards. Our suppliers and contract manufacturers are required to adhere to the same standards to maintain consistent product and service quality and continuous improvement of quality and environmental performance.\nWe use several third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers for materials and sub-assemblies. We believe that selectively using outsourced manufacturing services allows us to focus on our core competencies in product design and development, and increases our operational flexibility. We believe our manufacturing strategy allows us to adjust manufacturing capacity in response to changes in customer demand and to rapidly introduce new products to the market. We use Ablecom Technology, Inc. (“Ablecom”) and its affiliate Compuware Technology, Inc. (“Compuware”), both of which are related parties, for contract design and manufacturing coordination support. We work with Ablecom to optimize modular designs for our chassis and several other components. Ablecom also coordinates the manufacturing of chassis for us. In addition to providing a large volume of contract manufacturing services to us, Ablecom warehouses multiple components and subassemblies manufactured by various suppliers before shipping them to our facilities in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We also have a series of agreements with Compuware, including multiple product development, production and service agreements, as well as product manufacturing agreements and lease agreements for office space. See Note 10, “Related Party Transactions” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and Part III, Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.”\nWe continuously monitor our inventory to meet customer delivery requirements and minimize the risk of inventory obsolescence. Due to our building-block designs, our inventory can generally be used with multiple products, lowering working capital requirements and reducing the risk of inventory write-downs.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to new technological developments, changing customer needs and new product introductions. We compete primarily with large vendors of x86-based general purpose servers and components. In addition, we also face competition from smaller vendors that specialize in the sale of server components and systems. In recent years, we have experienced increased competition from original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) that benefit from their scale and very low-cost manufacturing and are increasingly offering their own branded products. We believe our principal competitors include:\n•\nglobal technology vendors, such as Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Lenovo; and\n•\nODMs, such as Foxconn, Quanta Computer, and Wiwynn Corporation.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 6\nTable of Contents\nThe principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\n•\nrack Scale Total IT Solutions to reduce TCO for our customers;\n•\nfirst to market with new emerging technologies, offered at a competitive price;\n•\nbroad product portfolio providing customers more options to optimize for their workload and environment;\n•\nhigh product performance, efficiency and reliability;\n•\nearly identification of emerging opportunities;\n•\ncost-effective design and manufacturing;\n•\nsufficient manufacturing capacity necessary to support market demand;\n•\nenergy efficient (Green Computing) product designs that reduce environmental impact, overall power consumption, and costs; and\n•\nlocalized and responsive customer support on a worldwide basis.\nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to most of these factors. However, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater name recognition, or deeper market penetration. They may be able to allocate more resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products, which could allow them to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer needs. In addition, it is possible that new competitors could emerge and gain significant market share.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur worldwide business activities subject us to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws in the countries in which we operate, and our Total IT Solutions are subject to laws and regulations affecting their sale. To date, costs and expenses incurred to comply with these governmental regulations, including environmental and import and export controls regulations, have not been material to our business, financial condition, results of operations, and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and import and export controls regulations, applicable to our operations or Total IT Solutions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material increases in expenditures for compliance with government regulations.\nWe are subject to U.S. and other applicable trade control regulations that restrict with whom we may transact business, including the trade sanctions enforced by the U.S. Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control and the import and export controls enforced by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations restricting dealings with sanctioned countries, companies and/or persons subject to restricted party lists or parties engaged in restricted end uses, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including civil or criminal penalties. The United States and other countries continually update their lists of export-controlled items and technologies and may impose new or more-restrictive export requirements on our products in the future. As a result of regulatory changes, we may be required to obtain licenses or other authorizations to continue supporting existing customers or to supply existing products to new customers in China, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere. Further escalations in trade restrictions or hostilities, particularly between the United States and China, could impede our ability to sell or support our products. Our joint venture in China may become subject to additional trade restrictions, and those trade restrictions could harm our reputation in the market.\nIn October 2022, U.S. export restrictions and export licensing requirements were imposed targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop, produce or manufacture certain chips in China (including Hong Kong). At the same time, export restrictions and export license requirements were also imposed on certain GPUs and advanced integrated circuits, as well as computing equipment containing such components, with a focus on China (including Hong Kong). These restrictions impacted certain of our products, including products that contain the NVIDIA A100 and H100 integrated circuits, among others. \nIn November 2023, the export control restrictions on advanced integrated circuits, supercomputing and other end uses were revised and further expanded to cover additional countries where we sell our products, such as those in the Middle East, as well as additional parties based on the location of their headquarters, or the headquarters of their ultimate parent. Compliance with ever-changing regulations is complex and time consuming. We may experience delays in implementing procedures to address the evolving regulatory requirements.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 7\nTable of Contents\nIn January 2025, the U.S. export control regulations targeting advanced integrated circuits and computing were further revised to include a worldwide authorization requirement for certain of our advanced computing products. New license exceptions were added to the regulations, allowing us to export in some cases without the need for an export license, thus expanding upon previous authorizations. However, these new regulations will, depending on the country and ultimate consignee, impose new limits on the number of advanced computing products that we can export to each ultimate consignee per calendar year, as well as the number of advanced computing products that the Commerce Department will license per-country over a given period to all exporters in the aggregate. These new limitations create a competitive process for obtaining the product allocation associated with these new government authorizations and therefore could disadvantage us relative to certain of our competitors. The limitations may also prevent us from selling our advanced computing products to the full extent of customer demand in certain countries that have not historically been subject to such limitations.\nIn May 2025, the U.S. Commerce Department announced that it is in the process of rescinding certain export control rules for advanced integrated circuits and computing systems and has ceased enforcement of certain aspects of the regulations previously issued in January 2025. The Commerce Department has indicated that it will issue new replacement export control regulations in the future, but the scope and timing of those regulatory changes remain uncertain. Such regulatory changes could impact our new and existing business, and place new regulatory requirements on our suppliers, customers and/or end users, or on the data centers into which our products are deployed. \nThe process to obtain licenses required under the recently adopted export control regulations is complicated and time-consuming in the event we determine to pursue them, and there is no guarantee that they will be granted. Our competitive position and future results may be harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in import and export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, end use, deemed export, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if licenses are not granted in a timely manner or denied to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if requested licenses are granted, they may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process could make our technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, encouraging customers to pursue alternatives to our products.\nSee “Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock, and Other Matters” for additional discussion of risks related to government regulation.\nHuman Capital Resources and Management\nMission, Culture, and Engagement\nThe key to success in technology is designing a company around people committed to work that they love. We aim to attract, develop, and retain a high performing and engaged global workforce. \nAs of June 30, 2025, we employed 6,238 employees, consisting of 3,255 employees engaged in research and development, 705 engaged in sales and marketing, 545 engaged in general and administrative and 1,733 engaged in manufacturing. Of these employees, 2,948 employees are based in our San Jose, California facilities. We consider our highly qualified and motivated employees to be a key factor in our business success. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.\nWe are committed to protecting the environment through our “We Keep IT Green” initiative as a first to market innovator in high-performance, high-efficiency server, storage, networking, and management total solutions. We recognize the critical importance of talent and culture to our success and ability to fulfill this vision.\nWe encourage opportunities for growth and conduct regular performance reviews that set clear expectations to motivate employees and align their performance with our objectives. We communicate to our employees through a secure intranet site, executive communications, company meetings, and business-related emails.\nWe also believe that a workplace that encourages different voices, perspectives, and backgrounds fosters stronger teams, better solutions, and greater innovation. Employees should be treated fairly and respectfully regardless of their differences and feel welcomed to share their unique perspective, which we believe empowers valued contributors.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 8\nTable of Contents\nTalent Development, Acquisition, Retention and Rewards\nTalent Strategy\nOur talent strategy focuses on attracting skilled, engaged employees who bring the talent and skills critical to our innovative and forward-looking workforce. Our recruiting process actively sources talent supporting our ability to hire candidates with professional qualifications and potential. We identify opportunities through tracking and analyzing data from various sources such as annual performance reviews to assess our progress in ensuring critical talent fills critical roles.  \nIt is our policy to ensure equal employment opportunity for all applicants and employees without regard to prohibited considerations of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, or any other classification protected by applicable local, state or federal laws. All employees receive training on the prevention of sexual harassment and abusive conduct in the workplace.\nTotal Rewards Program\nOur total rewards program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary in the form of cash and representing fixed compensation to reward individual performance and contributions (“Base Salary”), incentive bonus programs, and long-term equity awards, such as restricted stock units and options, which are tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation, aligns employee and stockholder interests, incentivizes business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivates based on long-term company performance, and integrates compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we provide U.S. employees with a range of benefits, including life and health insurance (medical, dental, and vision), paid time off, sick leave, holiday pay, and a 401(k) plan. For employees outside of the U.S., we offer benefits based on local requirements.\nHealth, Safety & Wellness\nThroughout our history, we have remained committed to providing a safe workplace that protects against personal injury and minimizes environmental harm. We adhere to international standards and regulations to ensure product safety and security. Our health and safety programs emphasize personal accountability, professional conduct, and regulatory compliance, while fostering a culture of proactivity, caution, and open communication. In developing our products, we define and conduct various tests to ensure their safety and security. We evaluate risks using both government-mandated procedures and industry best practices to understand residual risk and appropriately safeguard our employees. Our proactive efforts to prevent occupational illnesses and injuries enable us to maintain a safe, healthy, and secure workplace. Additionally, we have a Safety Committee, dedicated to promoting communication about health, safety, and emergency response procedures, as well as facilitating continuous improvements to our work environment and practices. \nWe are committed to complying with all applicable laws related to labor and employment across every aspect of our operations. Beyond legal requirements, we adhere to global standards regarding the fair and ethical treatment of workers, such as those set by the Responsible Business Alliance, regarding the fair and ethical treatment of workers. These include preventing excessive working hours and unfair wages, implementing controls to prohibit child labor and human trafficking, and bolstering workplace health and safety measures. \nBoard Oversight of Human Capital Management\nOur Board of Directors, as part of its overall responsibility to provide oversight, has purview over matters related to human capital management. Our Compensation Committee oversees various aspects of human capital management, such as incentive and equity compensation plans, the administration of these plans, compensation matters outside the ordinary course of business, and compensation policies.\nCorporate Information\nWe were founded and maintain our worldwide headquarters in San Jose, California, where approximately half of our employees are based. As one of the largest employers in the City of San Jose, we are proud to be an active member of the San Jose and Silicon Valley communities.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 9\nTable of Contents\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1993 and subsequently reincorporated in Delaware in March 2007. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SMCI”. Our principal executive offices are located at 980 Rock Avenue, San Jose, California 95131. Our telephone number is (408) 503-8000, and our website address is www.supermicro.com.\nFinancial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nPlease see Note 15, “Segment Reporting” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for information regarding segment reporting, and Note 4, “Revenue” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for information regarding our net sales by geographic region. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for further information on risks associated with our international operations.\nWorking Capital\nWe place significant emphasis on managing our inventories and other working capital related items. We manage inventories through active communication with our customers and partners, using our industry experience to accurately forecast demand. Based on these forecasts, we place manufacturing orders for our products. We maintain substantial inventories of our products because the computer server industry is characterized by short lead-time orders and quick delivery schedules. Additionally, during fiscal year 2025, the computer server industry experienced global supply chain shortages, which resulted in a need to carry more inventory to fulfill demand from our customers and partners. \nForward Stock Split\nOn September 30, 2024, we filed an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a ten-for-one forward split (the “Stock Split”) of our common stock without any change to its par value. The Amendment also effected a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock from 100,000,000 to 1,000,000,000. Pursuant to Section 242(d) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, stockholder approval was not required in connection with the foregoing.\nThe Stock Split became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 30, 2024.

  "item7": "Item 7.        Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly under the heading “Risk Factors.” \nOverview\nWe are a global leader in Application-Optimized Total IT Solutions. Founded and operating in San Jose, California, we are committed to delivering first-to-market innovation for Enterprise, Cloud, AI, and 5G Telco/Edge IT Infrastructure. As a Total IT Solutions manufacturer, our offerings include server, AI systems, storage, IoT devices, switches, software, and support services. Supermicro's expertise in motherboard, power, and chassis design expertise drives our ability to develop and produce next-generation innovations, from cloud to edge, for our global customers. Our products are designed and manufactured in-house across facilities in the United States, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. Leveraging our global operations for scale and efficiency, we optimize solutions to improve TCO while reducing environmental impact through Green Computing initiatives. Our award-winning portfolio of Server Building Block Solutions empowers customers to tailor systems precisely to their exact workloads and applications. By selecting from a broad family of flexible and reusable building blocks, customers can configure a comprehensive range of form factors, processors, memory, GPUs, storage, networking, power, and cooling solutions, including air-conditioned, free air, and liquid cooling solutions.\nWe commenced operations in 1993 and have been profitable every year since inception. For fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, our net income was $1,048.9 million, $1,152.7 million, and $640.0 million, respectively. \nIn order to increase our sales and profits, we believe that we must continue to develop flexible application optimized server and storage solutions while being among the first to market with new features and products. Our focus is on delivering Total IT Solutions that integrate, validate, and deliver server, storage, networking and software at the rack and cluster (multi-rack) level. Additionally, we will continue to expand our software offerings and enhance customer service and support, particularly as we increase our focus on large enterprise and data center customers. A key component of our strategy is our DCBBS, which significantly reduces data center build time and enables full integration of AI computing, server, storage, networking, rack, cabling, liquid cooling, end-to-end management software, onsite deployment services, and ongoing maintenance. To further expand our market share, we also recognize the need to strengthen our network of sales partners and distribution channels. \nWe measure our financial success based on various key indicators, including growth in net sales, gross profit margin, operating margin, and net income per common share. In additional to these financial metrics, a critical non-financial indicator of our success is our ability to rapidly introduce new products and deliver the latest application-optimized server and storage solutions. To support this, we work closely with the developers and manufacturers of key components, allowing us to integrate emerging technologies as they become available. Our ability to quickly bring new products to market, which we believe is enabled by our Building Block Solution architecture and has historically enabled us to capitalize on major technology transitions such as the launch of new GPUs, microprocessors and storage technologies. Accordingly, we closely monitor the product introduction cycles of industry leaders, including NVIDIA Corporation, Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Broadcom Inc., Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Micron Technology, Inc. and others. This strategic focus directly informs our research and development investments, as we continue to allocate resources toward both our current initiatives and future product innovation.\nAI and Data Centers \nThe growing use of AI, which requires enhanced datacenter capabilities, has substantially increased demand for our products. We expect this trend to continue, with further demand for datacenter expansion driven by the AI market. As a result, we will continue to enhance our product capabilities and expand our service offerings, including DCBBS to address the growing demand in the AI market and datacenter markets. We believe that our ability to tailor certain products to the unique needs of these sectors sets us apart from many competitors and positions us to capture an even greater market share going forward.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 41\nTable of Contents\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, tariffs, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have had and may continue to have direct and indirect impacts on our business and results of operations, particularly demand for our products and net sales. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors have also impacted and may continue to impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments.  Further, while many of these macroeconomic factors could have a long term impact, others may have a short term impact which could lead to our financial results not being comparable on a period to period basis.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following is a summary of our financial highlights for fiscal years 2025 and 2024:\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n21,972,042 \n$\n14,989,251 \nGross profit\n2,429,922 \n2,061,410 \nTotal operating expenses\n1,176,928\n850,636 \nIncome from operations\n1,252,994 \n1,210,774 \nNet income\n1,048,854 \n1,152,666 \nNet income per diluted share\n1.68 \n1.92 \n•\nNet sales increased by 46.6% in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024. driven by an increase in demand from customers for GPU servers, HPC and rack-scale solutions which have higher average selling prices, primarily due to large enterprise and data center customers from the United States, Asia, and Europe where we experienced significant growth.\n•\nGross margin decreased to 11.1% in fiscal year 2025 from 13.8% in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to our strategy to offer competitive pricing to gain market share, change in product and customer mix, and higher manufacturing related expenses.\n•\nOperating expenses increased by 38.4% in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024, primarily due to higher headcount and increases in salary and stock-based compensation.\n•\nNet income decreased to $1,048.9 million in fiscal year 2025 as compared to $1,152.7 million in fiscal year 2024, which was primarily due to decrease in gross profit and increase in operating and other expenses partially, offset by the increase in net sales in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nGeneral\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we regularly evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial statements. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. \nFor further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1. “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 42\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sale of server and storage systems, including systems and related services, subsystems and accessories.\nWe apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. As part of determining the transaction price in contracts with customers, we estimate reserves for future sales returns based on our history of actual returns for each major product line. Based upon historical experience, a refund liability is recorded at the time of sale for estimated product returns and an asset is recognized for the amount expected to be recorded in inventory upon product return, less the expected recovery costs.\nWe allocate the transaction price of each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative Standalone Selling Price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue at the time the respective performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the promised good or service to a customer. Determining the relative SSP for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations requires significant judgment. We determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we apply judgment to estimate the SSP. For substantially all of the performance obligations, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices, internally approved pricing guidelines with respect to geographies, customer type, internal costs, and gross margin objectives for the related performance obligations which can also be influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, economic and other factors.\nRevenue is recognized either over time or at a point in time, depending on when control of the underlying products or services are transferred to the customer, which may require judgment. Revenue is recognized at a point in time for products. Revenue is recognized over time for extended warranty and on-site services provided and at a point in time for other services such as rack installation and integration services.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at lower of cost, using weighted average cost method, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of our products in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventories consist of raw materials (principally electronic components), work in process (principally products being assembled) and finished goods (principally finished products and products ready for sale). We evaluate inventory on a quarterly basis for lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolescence and, as necessary, write down the valuation of inventories. \nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of our products in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. \nOur inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers’ lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 43\nTable of Contents\nWe receive various rebate incentives from certain suppliers based on our contractual arrangements, including volume-based rebates. The rebates earned are recognized as a reduction of cost of inventories and reduce the cost of sales in the period when the related inventory is sold. \nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. \nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. \nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. \nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. \nResults of Operations \nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nNet sales primarily consist of sales of our server and storage solutions, including systems and related services, subsystems, and accessories. The key factors that impact net sales of our server and storage systems are the number of servers and racks sold, as well as the average selling prices per server or rack. For subsystems and accessories, the main drivers of net sales are the number of units shipped and the average selling price per unit. The prices for our server and storage systems can vary widely depending on the configuration, including factors such as speed, functionality and performance of key components, including CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, cooling systems, and memory. Similarly, the prices for our subsystems and accessories fluctuate depending on the relative value of the specific item being purchased. such as power supplies, server boards, chassis or other accessories.\nCost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of sales primarily consists of the costs to manufacture our products, which includes: the costs of components and materials, contract manufacturing, shipping, personnel expenses (salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses), equipment and facility expenses, warranty costs and inventory reserve charges.\nWe use several suppliers and contract manufacturers to design and manufacture subsystems in accordance with our specifications, with most final assembly and testing performed at our manufacturing facilities in the region where our products are sold. We work with Ablecom, one of our key contract manufacturers and a related party, for our chassis and certain other components. We also outsource a significant part of the manufacturing of certain components, particularly power supplies, to Compuware, also a related party. We also collaborate on design and development activities with Ablecom and Compuware, where we substantially fund the design costs and retain the intellectual property rights. Our purchases of products from Ablecom and Compuware combined represented\n \n3.3%, 4.3%, and 6.6% of our cost of sales for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. For further details on our dealings with related parties, see Note 10, “Related Party Transactions” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 44\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of personnel expenses including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our research and development personnel, as well as product development costs such as materials and supplies, consulting services, third-party testing services and equipment and facility expenses related to our research and development activities.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our sales and marketing personnel, cost for trade shows, sales representative fees and marketing programs. From time to time, we receive marketing development funding from certain suppliers. Under these arrangements, we are reimbursed for certain marketing costs that we incur as part of the joint promotion of our products and those of our suppliers. These amounts offset a portion of the related expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported sales and marketing expenses. \nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of general corporate costs, including personnel expenses such as salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our general and administrative personnel, financial reporting, corporate governance and compliance, outside legal, audit, tax fees, insurance and credit losses on accounts receivable.\nOther Income, Net and Interest Expense\nOther income, net and interest expense consists of interest earned on our investments and cash balances, interest incurred on our debt, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur income tax provision is based on our taxable income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which primarily include the United States, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits, certain non-deductible expenses, tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income, and stock-based compensation. A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 12, “Income Taxes” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents certain items of our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 (in millions):\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n*\n2023\n*\nNet sales\n$\n21,972.0 \n$\n14,989.2 \n$\n7,123.5 \nCost of sales\n19,542.1 \n12,927.8 \n5,840.5 \nGross profit\n2,429.9 \n2,061.4 \n1,283.0 \nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\n636.6 \n463.5 \n307.3 \nSales and marketing\n273.1 \n189.7 \n115.0 \nGeneral and administrative\n267.2 \n197.4 \n99.6 \nTotal operating expenses\n1,176.9 \n850.6 \n521.9 \nIncome from operations\n1,253.0 \n1,210.8 \n761.1 \nOther income, net\n18.5 \n22.7 \n3.6 \nInterest expense\n(59.6)\n(19.4)\n(10.5)\nIncome before income tax provision\n1,211.9 \n1,214.1 \n754.3 \nIncome tax provision\n(156.8)\n(63.3)\n(110.7)\nShare of income (loss) from equity investee, net of taxes\n(6.2)\n1.8 \n(3.6)\nNet income\n$\n1,048.9 \n$\n1,152.7 \n$\n640.0 \n* Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nThe following table presents certain items of our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023:\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales\n88.9 \n%\n86.2 \n%\n82.0 \n%\nGross profit\n11.1 \n%\n13.8 \n%\n18.0 \n%\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\n2.9 \n%\n3.1 \n%\n4.3 \n%\nSales and marketing\n1.2 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n1.3 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n1.4 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n5.4 \n%\n5.7 \n%\n7.3 \n%\nIncome from operations\n5.7 \n%\n8.1 \n%\n10.7 \n%\nOther income, net\n0.1 \n%\n0.1 \n%\n0.1 \n%\nInterest expense\n(0.3)\n%\n(0.1)\n%\n(0.1)\n%\nIncome before income tax provision\n5.5 \n%\n8.1 \n%\n10.7 \n%\nIncome tax provision\n(0.7)\n%\n(0.4)\n%\n(1.6)\n%\nShare of income (loss) from equity investee, net of taxes\n— \n%\n— \n%\n(0.1)\n%\nNet income\n4.8 \n%\n7.7 \n%\n9.0 \n%\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 46\nTable of Contents\nNet Sales by Product Type\nThe following table presents net sales by product type for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025 over 2024 Change\n2024 over 2023 Change\n2025\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n$\n%\nServer and storage systems\n$\n21,311.6 \n$\n14,185.2 \n$\n6,569.8 \n$\n7,126.4 \n50.2 \n%\n$\n7,615.4 \n115.9 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n97.0 \n%\n94.6 \n%\n92.2 \n%\nSubsystems and accessories\n$\n660.4 \n804.0 \n553.7 \n(143.6)\n(17.9)\n%\n250.3 \n45.2 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n3.0 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n7.8 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n21,972.0 \n$\n14,989.2 \n$\n7,123.5 \n$\n6,982.8 \n46.6 \n%\n$\n7,865.7 \n110.4 \n%\nFiscal Year 2025 Compared with Fiscal Year 2024\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we experienced increased net sales from server and storage systems, particularly from our large enterprise and datacenter customers. The year-over-year increase in net sales of server and storage systems was primarily due to the strong demand and increased billings for GPU & Super Racks of $5,804.0 million or 52% compared to prior year, including liquid-cooled and air-cooled servers which are generally more complex and of higher value, primarily related to our H200, H100, and B200 systems, resulting in an increase of average selling price of 34%. Our services and software net sales, included in server and storage systems net sales, increased by $102.2 million year-over-year.\nThe year-over-year decrease in net sales for our subsystems and accessories is primarily due to our strategic shift to focus on prioritizing sales of our server and storage systems.\nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we experienced increased net sales from server and storage systems, particularly from our large enterprise and datacenter customers. The year-over-year increase in net sales of server and storage systems was primarily due to the strong demand for GPU based rack-scale solutions, including liquid-cooled and air-cooled servers which are generally more complex and of higher value, resulting in an increase of average selling prices. \nThe year-over-year increase in net sales for our subsystems and accessories is primarily due to increased demand of accessories sold to our larger enterprise and data center customers as more accessories and spares were purchased in conjunction with the increased volume of full systems and servers. Our services and software net sales, included in server and storage systems net sales, increased by $53.8 million year-over-year. \nNet Sales by Geography\nThe following table presents percentages of net sales by geographic region for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 (dollars in millions): \nYears Ended June 30,\n2025 over 2024 Change\n2024 over 2023 Change\n2025\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n$\n%\nUnited States\n$\n13,052.6 \n$\n10,187.2 \n$\n4,834.1 \n$\n2,865.4 \n28.1 \n%\n$\n5,353.1 \n110.7 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n59.4 \n%\n68.0 \n%\n67.9 \n%\nAsia\n5,494.1 \n2,912.6 \n1,050.8 \n2,581.5 \n88.6 \n%\n1,861.8 \n177.2 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n25.0 \n%\n19.4 \n%\n14.7 \n%\nEurope\n2,727.0 \n1,294.0 \n1,003.1 \n1,433.0 \n110.7 \n%\n290.9 \n29.0 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n12.4 \n%\n8.6 \n%\n14.1 \n%\nOthers\n698.3 \n595.4 \n235.5 \n102.9 \n17.3 \n%\n359.9 \n152.8 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n3.2 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n3.3 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n21,972.0 \n$\n14,989.2 \n$\n7,123.5 \n$\n6,982.8 \n46.6 \n%\n$\n7,865.7 \n110.4 \n%\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 47\nTable of Contents\nFiscal Year 2025 Compared with Fiscal Year 2024\nThe year-over-year increase in total net sales is driven by an increase in demand from customers for GPU servers, HPC and rack-scale solutions which have higher average selling prices, especially from large enterprise and data center customers resulting in increased sales of 28.1% in the United States, 85.9% in Thailand and Japan, and 111.9% in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Spain, where we have experienced significant growth.\nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\nThe year-over-year increase in total net sales is driven by an increase in demand from customers for GPU servers, HPC and rack-scale solutions which have higher average selling prices, especially for large enterprise and data center customers from the United States. The year-over-year increase of net sales in the regions outside the United States is mainly due to an increase in net sales in Singapore, Taiwan, South Africa and Germany, including the increase in demand from customers for GPU servers in those countries. \nCost of Sales, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin\nCost of sales and gross margin for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025 over 2024 Change\n2024 over 2023 Change\n2025\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n$\n%\nCost of sales\n$\n19,542.1 \n$\n12,927.8 \n$\n5,840.5 \n$\n6,614.3 \n51.2 \n%\n$\n7,087.3 \n121.3 \n%\nGross profit\n2,429.9 \n2,061.4 \n1,283.0 \n368.5 \n17.9 \n%\n778.4 \n60.7 \n%\nGross margin\n11.1 \n%\n13.8 \n%\n18.0 \n%\n(2.7)\n%\n(4.2)\n%\nFiscal Year 2025 Compared with Fiscal Year 2024\nThe year-over-year increase in cost of sales was primarily attributed to an increase of $6,353.2 million or 50.6% in costs of components, materials, and contract manufacturing expenses primarily due to increases in shipments of GPU servers, HPC, and rack-scale solutions which have higher costs and a $86.5 million or 493.6% increase in tariff expense related to new trade policies enacted during the year, a $149.6 million or 179.2% increase in inventory write-down adjustments from aged inventory, a $67.9 million or 28.6% increase in overhead costs which includes higher labor costs attributed to increase of operating activities, and a $43.6 million or 75.5% increase in freight charges.\nThe year-over-year decrease of 2.7% in gross margin percentage was primarily due to our strategy to offer competitive pricing to gain market share, increased competition and a change in product and customer mix.\nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\nThe year-over-year increase in cost of sales was primarily attributed to an increase of $7,006.7 million in costs of components, materials and contract manufacturing expenses primarily related to the increase in shipments of GPU servers, HPC, and rack scale solutions which have higher costs, a $52.3 million increase in inventory write-down adjustments, a $19.6 million increase in overhead costs which includes labor costs attributed to increase of operation activities and a $8.7 million increase in freight charges.\nThe year-over-year decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to our strategy to offer competitive pricing to gain market share, increased competition and a change in product and customer mix.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 48\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses \nOperating expenses for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025 over 2024 Change\n2024 over 2023 Change\n2025\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n$\n%\nResearch and development\n$\n636.6 \n$\n463.5 \n$\n307.3 \n$\n173.1 \n37.3 \n%\n$\n156.2 \n50.8 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n2.9 \n%\n3.1 \n%\n4.3 \n%\nSales and marketing\n273.1 \n189.7 \n115.0 \n83.4 \n44.0 \n%\n74.7 \n65.0 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n1.2 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n267.2 \n197.4 \n99.6 \n69.8 \n35.4 \n%\n97.8 \n98.2 \n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n1.3 \n%\n1.3 \n%\n1.4 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n1,176.9 \n$\n850.6 \n$\n521.9 \n$\n326.3 \n38.4 \n%\n$\n328.7 \n63.0 \n%\nFiscal Year 2025 Compared with Fiscal Year 2024\n \nResearch and development expenses.\n The year-over-year increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by a $153.2 million or 34.7% increase in employee-related costs, mainly comprised of a $81.0 million or 70.0% increase in stock-based compensation, and $60.2 million or 20.2% increase in salaries, as we expanded our workforce and invested in key talent. Additionally, there was a $28.3 million or 78.3% increase in product development costs to support the development of next-generation products and technologies. These increases along with other immaterial cost increases were partially offset by an $11.0 million or 50.9% increase in research and development fees received from certain suppliers and customers. Looking ahead, we expect research and development expenses to continue to rise as we expand our workforce and invest in key talent to remain at the forefront of innovation in next-generation products and technologies.\nSales and marketing expenses.\n The year-over-year increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by a $53.5 million or 30.9% increase in employee-related costs, mainly due to a $30.9 million  or 23.0% increase in salaries and a $16.6 million or 78.3% increase in stock-based compensation, similarly to our research and development expenses as we expanded our workforce and invested in key talent company-wide. Additionally, there was a $50.0 million or 164.6% increase in advertising, travel, and other related expenses due to an increase in our marketing efforts to support the launch and promotion of new products. These increases, along with other immaterial cost increases, were partially offset by a $20.8 million or 132.6% increase in additional marketing development fees received from certain vendors. Looking ahead, we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to rise as we expand our workforce and invest in key talent.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. \nThe year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by a $74.0 million or 241.0% increase in professional and service fees, reflecting higher costs for external accounting, audit, tax, legal, and advisory services, primarily driven by the Special Committee investigation and the delay in filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024. These services were necessary to support enhancements in our external reporting processes and compliance activities during fiscal year ended 2025. Additionally, there was a $20.7 million or 37.5% increase in facilities costs such as rental costs, utility costs, and indirect depreciation costs, which are related to our efforts to expand our production capacity in order to support growing customer demands. These increases, along with other immaterial cost increases, were partially offset by a $22.8 million or 28.6% decrease in employee-related costs related to stock-based compensation. Looking ahead, we expect general and administrative expenses to continue rising as we invest in process improvements, expand our workforce, and attract key talent to support our strategic initiatives and operational growth.\nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\nResearch and development expenses.\n The year-over-year increase in research and development expenses was driven by a $140.4 million increase in employee related costs primarily due to stock-based compensation increases of $84.2 million, salary increases and higher headcount as we expanded our workforce and invested in key talent, a $17.1 million increase in product development costs to support next generation products and technologies, offset by a $1.3 million increase in research and development fees. We believe that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we continue to expand our workforce and invest in key talent to stay at the forefront of development of next generation products and technologies.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 49\nTable of Contents\nSales and marketing expenses.\n The year-over-year increase in sales and marketing expenses was driven by a $64.8 million increase in employee related costs primarily due to stock-based compensation increases of $16.6 million, salary increases and higher headcount as we expanded our workforce and invested in key talent, a $10.6 million increase in advertising and other expenses offset by a $0.7 million increase in marketing development fees received. We believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we continue to expand our workforce and invest in key talent.\nGeneral and administrative expenses.\n The year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses was driven by a $74.4 million increase in employee related costs primarily due to stock-based compensation increases of $65.0 million, salary increases and higher headcount as we expanded our workforce and invested in key talent, and a $23.4 million increase in professional and service fees and other expenses. We believe that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we continue to expand our workforce and invest in key talent.\nOther Income, Net and Interest Expense\nOther income, net and interest expense for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025 over 2024 Change\n2024 over 2023 Change\n2025\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n$\n%\nOther income, net\n$\n18.5 \n$\n22.7 \n$\n3.6 \n$\n(4.2)\n(18.5)\n%\n$\n19.1 \n530.6 \n%\nInterest expense\n(59.6)\n(19.4)\n(10.5)\n(40.2)\n207.2 \n%\n(8.9)\n84.8 \n%\nOther income, net and interest expense\n$\n(41.1)\n$\n3.3 \n$\n(6.9)\n$\n(44.4)\n(1,345.5)\n%\n$\n10.2 \n(147.8)\n%\nFiscal Year 2025 Compared with Fiscal Year 2024\nThe year-over-year decrease in other income, net, was primarily attributable to a $30.3 million or 100.0% increase for loss on extinguishment of our Original 2029 Convertible Notes resulting from the 2029 Convertible Notes Amendments (see Note 8, “Convertible Notes”), and a $17.9 million or 283.8% increase in foreign exchange losses. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a $34.6 million or 1774.1% increase in interest and amortization related to the amended 2029 Convertible Note and newly issued 2028 Convertible Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes. These increases in expense were partially offset by a $15.7 million or 119.5% net movement in investment gains/(loss), as we incurred a loss in prior year of $13.1 million and a gain in the current year of $2.6 million, and a $31.0 million or 104.8% increase in interest income due to higher average monthly cash balances held in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts. \nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\nThe increase in Other income, net of $19.1 million was driven by an increase of $26.1 million in interest income due to higher balances held in interest-bearing deposit accounts during the year, and an increase in foreign currency exchange gain of $6.1 million due to a strong US dollar, offset by a $13.1 million investment and impairment loss in equity securities. The increase in interest expense of $8.9 million was due to higher borrowing and higher interest rates on our outstanding line of credit and term loan balances.\nIncome Tax Provision\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025 over 2024 Change\n2024 over 2023 Change\n2025\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n$\n%\nIncome tax provision\n$\n(156.8)\n$\n(63.3)\n$\n(110.7)\n$\n(93.5)\n147.7 \n%\n$\n47.4 \n(42.8)\n%\nEffective tax rate\n(12.9)\n%\n(5.2)\n%\n(14.7)\n%\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 50\nTable of Contents\nFiscal Year 2025 Compared with Fiscal Year 2024\nThe year-over year increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to a decrease in the stock compensation tax deduction and lower research and development tax credits, both driven by the decrease in our stock price. The total effective tax rate increased by 7.7%, from 5.2% in fiscal year 2024, to 12.9% in fiscal year 2025.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2025, the OBBBA was enacted in the U.S. on July 4, 2025. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. We are currently assessing its impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, Malaysia enacted legislation to implement the OECD Pillar Two global minimum tax framework effective January 1, 2025. Our Malaysian subsidiary was incorporated in October 2022 and commenced operations in July 2025, at which time it began a 10-year income tax exemption under an approved government incentive program. We continue to monitor administrative guidance from the OECD and tax authorities regarding the interaction between the 10-year tax holiday and the 15% minimum tax requirement under Pillar Two and will evaluate the impact of such guidance when issued to determine whether adjustments to our income tax provision or financial statement disclosures are required.\nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\nThe year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to higher tax deductions from stock-based compensation, an increase in the R&D tax credit. As a result of these favorable elements which were partially offset by certain unfavorable items including an increase in IRC section 162(m) officers’ compensation tax add back, the total effective tax rate decreased by 9.5%, from 14.7% in fiscal year 2023, to 5.2% in fiscal year 2024.\nS\nhare of Income (Loss) from Equity Investee, Net of Taxes\nShare of income (loss) from equity investee, net of taxes represents our share of income (loss) from the Corporate Venture in which we have a 30% ownership.\nShare of income (loss) from equity investee, net of taxes for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025 over 2024 Change\n2024 over 2023 Change\n2025\n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n$\n%\nShare of income (loss) from equity investee, net of taxes\n$\n(6.2)\n$\n1.8 \n$\n(3.6)\n$\n(8.0)\n(444.4)\n%\n$\n5.4 \n(150.0)\n%\nPercentage of total net sales\n— \n%\n*\n— \n%\n*\n(0.1)\n%\n* Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\nFiscal Year 2025 Compared with Fiscal Year 2024\nThe period-over-period decrease of $8.0 million in share of income from equity investee, net of taxes was primarily due to reduction in profitability from reduced sales of the Corporate Venture. During the year ended June 30, 2025, we recognized an impairment of $6.7 million on this investment. Refer to Note 10, “Related Party Transactions” for more details.\nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\nThe period-over-period increase of $5.4 million in share of income from equity investee, net of taxes was primarily due to improvement in profitability from increased sales of the Corporate Venture.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 51\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our growth primarily with funds generated from operations, as well as utilizing borrowing facilities, selling our common stock, and issuing convertible notes. Recent drivers of liquidity changes included an increase in the need for working capital due to higher levels of inventory required by growing revenues, greater requests for longer payment terms from customers due to increasing system costs and to a lesser extent longer supply chain lead times on certain key components. Our cash and cash equivalents were $5,169.9 million and $1,669.8 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held in foreign locations was $607.2 million and $337.3 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \nAmounts held outside of the United States are typically used to meet non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations of these funds are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax, though state income or foreign withholding taxes may apply. In cases where local restrictions prevent the intercompany transfer of funds, our strategy is to retain cash balances outside the U.S. and meet liquidity needs through operating cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes on the repatriation of amounts held outside the U.S. to materially affect our overall liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, borrowing capacity available from our credit facilities and internally generated cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating businesses and maturing debt and interest payments for the 12 months following the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. We continue to assess financing options that may be necessary to support the growth of our business.\nOur key cash flow metrics were as follows (in millions):\nYears Ended June 30,\n2025 over 2024\n2024 over 2023\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n1,659.5 \n$\n(2,486.0)\n$\n663.6 \n$\n4,145.5 \n$\n(3,149.6)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(183.2)\n(194.2)\n(39.5)\n11.0 \n(154.7)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n2,024.0 \n3,911.7 \n(448.3)\n(1,887.7)\n4,360.0 \nEffect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash\n1.7 \n(2.2)\n(3.4)\n3.9 \n1.2 \nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n3,502.0 \n$\n1,229.3 \n$\n172.4 \n$\n2,272.7 \n$\n1,056.9 \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 mostly consisted of $1,048.9 million net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $314.5 million of share-based compensation expense, $58.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and changes in working capital. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue reduction in inventory purchase, partially offset by higher cash paid for interest and other operational spending.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2025 mostly consisted of $127.2 million of purchases of property, plant, and equipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, and $56.0 million of net purchases of non-marketable equity securities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was mostly due to decreases in net purchases of non-marketable equity securities, partially offset by higher purchases of property, plant, and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2025 mostly consisted of issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes and the 2030 Convertible Notes of $683.7 million and $2,256.0 million, respectively, partially offset by common stock repurchase of $200.0 million and net repayment of debts. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, was mostly due to decrease in issuance of common stock, decrease in proceeds from debt, and increase in repurchase of common stock, partially offset by increase in issuance of the convertible notes. \nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 52\nTable of Contents\nMaterial Cash Requirements\n \nRefer to Note 7, “Lines of Credit and Term Loans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further information on our outstanding debt.\nRefer to Note 8, “Convertible Notes”, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further information on the amendment of the terms of the 2029 Convertible Notes, and the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes and the 2030 Convertible Notes. \nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nWe anticipate our capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2026 will be in range of $180.0 million to $200.0 million, primarily relating to costs associated with our global manufacturing capabilities, including tooling for new products, new information technology investments, and facilities upgrades and expansion. We will also continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets. As a result, our future growth within the existing business or new opportunities and markets may dictate the need for additional facilities and capital expenditures to support that growth. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on net sales growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention).\nOur future capital requirements will depend on a variety of factors, including our growth rate, the timing and scale of investments to support product development, the expansion of sales and marketing efforts, the launch of new and enhanced software and services offerings, and continued investments in our office facilities and IT system infrastructure.\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated future obligations as of June 30, 2025, include both current and long-term obligations. For our long-term debt as noted in Note 7, “Lines of Credit and Term Loans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we have a current obligation of $75.1 million and a long-term obligation of $37.4 million. Additionally, as noted in Note 8, “Convertible Notes” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we have a convertible debt obligation of\n \n$4,725.0 million. Under our operating leases as noted in Note 9, “Leases” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we have a current obligation of $21.2 million and a long-term obligation of $280.4 million. Pursuant to the data center lease agreement dated June 14, 2025, we anticipate making an approximately $117.7 million lease payment subject to the remaining tranches expected to commence on October 2, 2025, which is not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as the lease has not commenced. As noted in Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we have current obligations related to non-cancelable purchase commitments of $1.6 billion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1, “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.\nSMCI | 2025 Form 10-K | 53\nTable of Contents",
