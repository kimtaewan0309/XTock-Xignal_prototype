Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Globe Life's \nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n and \nNotes\n thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. The following management discussion will only include comparison to prior year.\n\"Globe Life\" and the \"Company\" refer to Globe Life Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates.\nResults of Operations\nHow Globe Life Views Its Operations.\n Globe Life Inc. is the holding company for a group of insurance companies that market through exclusive, direct-to-consumer and independent distribution channels primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance to lower middle to middle-income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the insurance product lines of life and supplemental health, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. \nInsurance Product Line Segments. \nThe insurance product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and administration of policies. Each product line is further subdivided by the various distribution channels that market the insurance policies. Each distribution channel operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution channels within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, as seen below:\n Premium revenue\n                                                           (Policy obligations)\n                                                           \n(Policy acquisition costs and commissions) \n                                                            \nUnderwriting margin\nInvestment Segment.\n \nThe investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, as seen below:\n Net investment income\n(Required interest on policy liabilities) \n \n                                                           \nExcess investment income\n63\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis \nGlobe Life serves the lower-middle to middle-income market. We believe this market is underserved, has significant growth potential, and provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. This advantage is protected due not only to our ability to efficiently reach this market through both exclusive and direct to consumer distribution channels, but also due to the amount of data and experience we possess, as we have been in this same market for over 60 years with essentially the same products. The basic protection life and health insurance products we offer are specifically designed to help provide financial security to consumers in this market. \nCurrent Highlights.\n \n•\nNet income as a return on equity (ROE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 21.9% and net operating income as an ROE, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income\n(1)\n was 16.6%.\n•\nTotal premium increased 5% over the same period in the prior year. Life premium increased 3% for the period from $2.4 billion in 2024 to $2.5 billion in 2025. Health premium increased 8% to $1.1 billion over the prior-year period of $1.0 billion. \n•\nTotal net sales increased 6% over the same period in the prior year from $622 million in 2024 to $661 million in 2025. The average producing agent count across all of the exclusive agencies increased 4% over the prior year. \n•\nBook value per share increased 27% over the same period in the prior year from $54.65 to $69.52. Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income\n(1)\n, increased 12% over the prior year from $83.92 in 2024 to $93.63 in 2025. \n•\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $515 million for an average share price of $123.97.\nThe following graphs represent net income and net operating income for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n \n(1)\nAs shown in the charts above, net operating income is primarily comprised of insurance underwriting margin plus excess investment income and annuity and other income, offset by operating expenses after tax and, as such, is considered a non-GAAP measure. It has been used consistently by Globe Life's management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nNet operating income as an ROE, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"), is considered a non-GAAP measure. Management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of changes in AOCI, which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates. The impact of the adjustment to exclude AOCI is $(2.0) billion and $(2.5) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nBook value per share, excluding AOCI, is also considered a non-GAAP measure. Management utilizes this measure to view the book value of the business without the effect of changes in AOCI, which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates. The impact of the adjustment to exclude AOCI is $(24.11) and $(29.27) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nRefer to \nAnalysis of Profitability by Segment\n for non-GAAP reconciliation to GAAP.\n64\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis \nSummary of Operations. \n•\nNet income totaled $895 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with $816 million in the same period in 2024. \n•\nOn a diluted per common share basis, net income per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased 21% from $8.93 to $10.77.\n•\nNet operating income was $925 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with $843 million for the same period in 2024.\n•\nOn a diluted per common share basis, net operating income per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased from $9.23 to $11.13, a 21% increase. \nNet operating income is primarily comprised of insurance underwriting margin plus excess investment income and annuity and other income, offset by operating expenses, after tax and, as such, is considered a non-GAAP measure. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, net income was affected by certain non-operating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. We remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such items from our segment analysis for current periods. \nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company performed its annual assumptions review and updated both its life and health assumptions of lapses, mortality, and morbidity resulting in a $134.3 million net remeasurement gain as compared to a $46.3 million net remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of assumption changes, the Company's results for actual variances from expected experience for both life and health produced a $24.0 million net remeasurement gain and a $14.7 million net remeasurement gain for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. During nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company's results for actual variances from expected experience for both life and health produced a $53.6 million net remeasurement gain and a $38.4 million net remeasurement gain, respectively. \nAs previously noted, a component of insurance underwriting margin is policy obligations, which includes for each reporting period the change in the liability for future policy benefits (\"LFPB\"). The LFPB is determined each reporting period based on the net level premium method. Net level premiums reflect a recomputed net premium ratio using actual experience since the issue date, and expected future experience based on future cash-flow assumptions See \nNote 6—Policy Liabilities\n for additional information.\nOverall, the Company continues to see positive signs in its core operations, including sales and premium growth, and continues to achieve an operating ROE (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) generally in the mid-teens.\n65\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis \nGlobe Life's operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth below. Net operating income has been used consistently by management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from GAAP net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized gains and losses and other significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company’s business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nAnalysis of Profitability by Segment\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n%\nLife insurance underwriting margin\n$\n1,158,946 \n$\n1,016,517 \n$\n142,429 \n14 \nHealth insurance underwriting margin\n291,152 \n281,221 \n9,931 \n4 \nExcess investment income\n107,581 \n126,079 \n(18,498)\n(15)\nSegment profit or (loss)\n1,557,679 \n1,423,817 \n133,862 \n9 \nAnnuity and other income\n6,891 \n5,576 \n1,315 \n24 \nAdministrative expense\n(263,363)\n(251,072)\n(12,291)\n5 \nOther corporate expense\n(157,386)\n(129,169)\n(28,217)\n22 \nPre-tax total\n1,143,821 \n1,049,152 \n94,669 \n9 \nApplicable taxes\n(219,169)\n(205,977)\n(13,192)\n6 \nNet operating income\n \n924,652 \n843,175 \n81,477 \n10 \nReconciling items, net of tax:\nRealized gains (losses)\n(18,546)\n(20,998)\n2,452 \nOther expenses\n(393)\n(2,057)\n1,664 \nLegal proceedings\n(10,558)\n(4,554)\n(6,004)\nNet income\n \n$\n895,155 \n$\n815,566 \n$\n79,589 \n10 \nThe life insurance segment is our primary segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each period presented. The life insurance segment underwriting margin increased $142 million compared with the prior period, driven by premium growth in addition to remeasurement gains from the updating of assumptions, including updates  to mortality, morbidity, and lapse assumptions\n. The updates to mortality were the most significant as life segment claims continued to improve adding credibility to the favorable trend. Excess investment income declined $18 million compared with the prior period, as \nassets grew slightly less than liabilities primarily due to the impact of reinsurance transactions, as well as higher dividend distributions from the insurance companies to the Parent.\n In addition, we had lower earned yields on commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and short term investments\n Th\ne health segment experienced favorable underwriting margin as a result of higher premiums.\n66\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis \nIn 2025, the largest contributor of total underwriting margin was the life insurance segment and the primary distribution channel was the American Income Life Division (American Income). The following charts represent the breakdown of total underwriting margin by operating segment and distribution channel for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. \n \nTotal premium income rose 5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 to $3.6 billion. Total net sales increased 6% to $661 million, when compared with 2024. Total first-year collected premium (defined in the following section) increased 3% to $520 million for 2025, compared to $507 million in 2024. \nLife insurance premium income increased 3% to $2.51 billion over the prior-year total of $2.44 billion. Life net sales increased by $454 million for the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the year ago period. First-year collected life premium increased 1% to $347 million. Life underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, increased to 46% for 2025 from 42% in 2024. Underwriting margin increased to $1.2 billion in 2025, compared to $1.0 billion in 2024.\nHealth insurance premium income increased 8% to $1.1 billion over the prior-year total of $1.0 billion. Health net sales rose 21% to $207 million for the first nine months of 2025. First-year collected health premium rose 5% to $173 million. Health underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 26% for 2025 down from 27% in 2024. Health underwriting margin increased to $291 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $281 million in 2024.\nExcess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment, declined 15% during the first nine months of 2025 to $108 million from $126 million in 2024. Excess investment income per common share, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, declined 7% to $1.29 from $1.38 when compared with the same period in 2024.\nInsurance administrative expenses increased 5% primarily due to higher employee costs, which include salaries and other costs in addition to higher information technology expenses in 2025 when compared with the prior-year period. These expenses were 7.2% as a percent of premium for 2025 unchanged from 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $515 million for an average share price of $123.97. \n67\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis \nThe discussions of our segments are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in \nNote 12—Business Segments\n.\nWe use three measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: “annualized premium in force”, \"net sales,” and “first-year collected premium.” \n•\nAnnualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the 12-month period.\n•\nNet sales is calculated as annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first 30 days after issue, except in the case of Direct to Consumer, where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period (typically one month) has expired. Management considers net sales to be a better indicator of the rate of premium growth than annualized premium issued since annualized premium issued is before cancellations, as cancellations do not contribute to premium income.\n•\nFirst-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future. First-year collected premiums are lower than net sales over the prior 12 months because premiums are not collected on lapsed policies after the date of lapse.\nCancellations are not included in lapses.\nSee further discussion of the distribution channels below for \nLife\n and \nHealth\n.\n68\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis \nLIFE INSURANCE \nLife insurance is the Company's predominant segment. During 2025, life premium represented 69% of total premium and life underwriting margin represented 80% of the total underwriting margin. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of income attributable to the investment segment.\n \nThe following table presents the summary of results of life insurance. \nFurther discussion of the results by distribution channel is included below.\nLife Insurance\nSummary of Results\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n% of Premium\nAmount\n% of Premium\nAmount\n%\nPremium and policy charges\n$\n2,513,890 \n100 \n$\n2,438,385 \n100 \n$\n75,505 \n3 \nPolicy obligations\n1,410,622 \n56 \n1,493,165 \n61 \n(82,543)\n(6)\nRequired interest on reserves\n(632,150)\n(25)\n(605,397)\n(25)\n(26,753)\n4 \nNet policy obligations\n778,472 \n31 \n887,768 \n36 \n(109,296)\n(12)\nAmortization of acquisition costs\n285,417 \n12 \n263,753 \n11 \n21,664 \n8 \nCommission expense\n130,848 \n5 \n118,480 \n5 \n12,368 \n10 \nPremium taxes\n51,621 \n2 \n51,254 \n2 \n367 \n1 \nNon-deferred acquisition costs\n108,586 \n4 \n100,613 \n4 \n7,973 \n8 \nTotal expense\n1,354,944 \n54 \n1,421,868 \n58 \n(66,924)\n(5)\nInsurance underwriting margin\n \n$\n1,158,946 \n46 \n$\n1,016,517 \n42 \n$\n142,429 \n14 \nNet policy obligations amounted to 31% of premium for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 36% in the year-ago period.\nThe table below summarizes life underwriting margin by distribution channel.\n \nLife Insurance\nUnderwriting Margin by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\nAmount\n% of Premium\nAmount\n% of Premium\nAmount\n%\nAmerican Income\n$\n661,825 \n50 \n$\n600,976 \n47 \n$\n60,849 \n10 \nDirect to Consumer\n246,903 \n34 \n210,712 \n28 \n36,191 \n17 \nLiberty National\n135,508 \n46 \n106,486 \n38 \n29,022 \n27 \nOther\n(1)\n114,710 \n76 \n98,343 \n64 \n16,367 \n17 \nTotal\n \n$\n1,158,946 \n46 \n$\n1,016,517 \n42 \n$\n142,429 \n14 \n(1) Includes a gain of  $14 million related to the recapture of reinsurance for nine months ended September 30, 2025 as disclosed in \nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\n.\n69\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nThe following table presents Globe Life's life insurance premium by distribution channel.\nLife Insurance\nPremium by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n%\nAmerican Income\n$\n1,334,591 \n53 \n$\n1,265,417 \n52 \n$\n69,174 \n5 \nDirect to Consumer\n736,651 \n29 \n743,304 \n31 \n(6,653)\n(1)\nLiberty National\n291,635 \n12 \n276,599 \n11 \n15,036 \n5 \nOther\n151,013 \n6 \n153,065 \n6 \n(2,052)\n(1)\nTotal\n \n$\n2,513,890 \n100 \n$\n2,438,385 \n100 \n$\n75,505 \n3 \nAnnualized life premium in force was $3.40 billion at September 30, 2025, an increase of 3% over $3.29 billion a year earlier. \nAn analysis of life net sales, an indicator of new business production, by distribution channel is presented below. \nLife Insurance\nNet Sales by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n%\nAmerican Income\n$\n291,302 \n64 \n$\n288,602 \n64 \n$\n2,700 \n1 \nDirect to Consumer\n83,447 \n18 \n83,251 \n18 \n196 \n— \nLiberty National\n71,380 \n16 \n71,846 \n16 \n(466)\n(1)\nOther\n7,645 \n2 \n6,725 \n2 \n920 \n14 \nTotal\n \n$\n453,774 \n100 \n$\n450,424 \n100 \n$\n3,350 \n1 \nFirst-year collected life premium by distribution channel is presented in the table below.\n \nLife Insurance\nFirst-Year Collected Premium by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n%\nAmerican Income\n$\n237,119 \n68 \n$\n227,817 \n67 \n$\n9,302 \n4 \nDirect to Consumer\n45,877 \n13 \n52,080 \n15 \n(6,203)\n(12)\nLiberty National\n57,969 \n17 \n56,043 \n16 \n1,926 \n3 \nOther\n5,925 \n2 \n5,850 \n2 \n75 \n1 \nTotal\n \n$\n346,890 \n100 \n$\n341,790 \n100 \n$\n5,100 \n1 \n70\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nA discussion of life operations by distribution channel follows.\nThe \nAmerican Income Life Division\n is an exclusive agency that markets to members of labor unions and other affinity groups and continues to diversify its lead sources, utilizing internally generated leads, third-party internet vendor leads and referrals to facilitate sustainable growth. This Division is Globe Life's largest contributor of life premium of any distribution channel at 53% of the Company's September 30, 2025 total life premium. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the average monthly life premium issued per policy was $59 as compared to $56 for the same period in the prior year. Net sales were $291 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, up from $289 million in the year-ago period. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 47% for the same period in the prior year.\nThe average producing agent count increased 3% over the year-ago period. The increase in average producing agent count was driven by an increase in new agent recruiting along with continued improvement in new agent retention. Sales growth in this Division, as well as within our other exclusive agencies, is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force.\nBelow is the average producing agent count as of the indicated periods for the American Income Life Division. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the beginning and end of each week during the year.\nAt September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n%\nAmerican Income\n11,994 \n11,680 \n314 \n3 \nAmerican Income Life continues to focus on growing and strengthening the agency force, specifically through emphasis on agency middle-management growth and additional agency openings. In addition to offering financial incentives and training opportunities, the Division has made considerable investments in information technology, including a customer relationship management (CRM) tool for the agency force. This tool is designed to provide dashboards and drive productivity in lead distribution, conservation of business, and new agent recruiting. Additionally, this Division has invested in and successfully implemented technology that allows the agency force to engage in virtual recruiting, training, and sales activity. The agents have shifted to primarily a virtual experience with the customers and have generated a vast majority of sales through virtual presentations. We find this flexibility to be enticing for new recruits as well as a driver of retention in our agency force.\nThe \nDirect to Consumer Division\n (DTC) markets adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of channels, including direct mail, insert media, and digital marketing. The different media channels support and complement one another in the Division's efforts to provide consumer outreach. All three channels work as part of an omnichannel approach. Sales from the internet and inbound phone calls continue to outpace the activity from direct mail. DTC's long-term growth has been fueled by consistent innovation and brand awareness. Additionally, the DTC Division provides valuable support to our agency business through brand impressions and inquiries that lead to sales in our exclusive agency channels. We have implemented new technology to enhance our underwriting process, this has improved the conversion of customer inquiries into sales. New initiatives are continuously introduced to help increase response rates, issue rates, and create a seamless customer experience. The juvenile insurance market is an important source of sales as well as a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of existing juvenile insureds, who are more likely to respond favorably to a direct to consumer solicitation for life coverage on themselves in comparison to the general adult population. Additionally, future offerings to parents and grandparents for adult and juvenile insurance are sources of lower acquisition-cost life insurance sales in the future.\nDTC net sales were flat at  $83 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the year-ago period. We have seen net sales trending up the last two quarters and noted a 13% increase for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year three months ended. We have been focused on improving profitability and improving underwriting margin in this division. DTC’s underwriting margin was $246.9 million and 34% as a percent of premium for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $210.7 million and 28% as a percent of premium for the same period in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the average monthly life premium issued for DTC adults was $17 as compared to $15 for the same period in the prior year. \n71\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nThe \nLiberty National Division\n is an exclusive agency that markets individual life insurance to middle-income household and worksite customers. Recent investments in new sales technologies as well as recent growth in agency middle management within the Division are expected to support increased sales. Underwriting margin rose 27% from the year ago period to $136 million and premium increased 5% to $292 million. The underwriting margin as a percent of premium  increased  for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, to 46% compared to 38%  in year-ago period.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the average monthly life premium per policy issued rose slightly compared to the prior year to $44 from  $43. \nBelow is the average producing agent count for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 for the Liberty National Division.

This Division continues to execute a long-term plan to grow through expansion from small-town markets in the Southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers. Expansion of this Division’s presence in larger geographic cities, with less penetrated areas will help create long-term sustainable agency growth. Additionally, the Division continues to help improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite business. A CRM platform and enhanced analytical capabilities have helped the agents develop additional worksite marketing opportunities and improve the productivity of agents selling in the individual life market. As the Division gains momentum in its sales and recruiting initiatives, advances in technology and use of the CRM platform, it anticipates continued growth in recruiting activity, average producing agent count, and net sales.\nThe \nOther \nagency distribution channels primarily include non-exclusive independent agencies selling primarily life insurance. The Other distribution channels contributed $151 million of life premium income, or 6% of Globe Life's total life premium income in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and contributed 2% of net sales for the period.\nHEALTH INSURANCE\nHealth insurance sold by the Company primarily includes Medicare Supplement insurance as well as retiree health insurance, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products such as cancer, critical illness, heart disease, accident, intensive care, and other health products. \nHealth premium accounted for 31% of our total premium in 2025, while the health underwriting margin accounted for 20% of total underwriting margin. Health underwriting margin increased to $291 million compared to $281 million in the prior year. While the Company continues to emphasize life insurance sales relative to health, due to life’s long-term profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income, the health business provides a significant contribution to return on equity as it does not require a substantial amount of up-front capital. \n72\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nThe following table presents underwriting margin data for health insurance.\nHealth Insurance\nSummary of Results\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\nChange\n \n2025\n2024\n \nAmount\n% of\nPremium\nAmount\n% of\nPremium\nAmount\n%\nPremium\n$\n1,134,414 \n100 \n$\n1,046,617 \n100 \n$\n87,797 \n8 \nPolicy obligations\n691,793 \n61 \n629,676 \n60 \n62,117 \n10 \nRequired interest on reserves\n(85,194)\n(8)\n(82,300)\n(8)\n(2,894)\n4 \nNet policy obligations\n606,599 \n53 \n547,376 \n52 \n59,223 \n11 \nAmortization of acquisition costs\n44,497 \n4 \n40,774 \n4 \n3,723 \n9 \nCommission expense\n127,551 \n11 \n117,773 \n11 \n9,778 \n8 \nPremium taxes\n22,423 \n2 \n21,221 \n2 \n1,202 \n6 \nNon-deferred acquisition costs\n42,192 \n4 \n38,252 \n4 \n3,940 \n10 \nTotal expense\n843,262 \n74 \n765,396 \n73 \n77,866 \n10 \nInsurance underwriting margin\n \n$\n291,152 \n26 \n$\n281,221 \n27 \n$\n9,931 \n4 \nNet policy obligations amounted to 53% of premium for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 52% in the year ago period.\nThe table below summarizes health underwriting margin by distribution channel.\n \nHealth Insurance\nUnderwriting Margin by Distribution Channel\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\nAmount\n% of Premium\nAmount\n% of Premium\nAmount\n%\nUnited American\n$\n30,117 \n6 \n$\n42,500 \n10 \n$\n(12,383)\n(29)\nFamily Heritage\n130,785 \n38 \n106,481 \n34 \n24,304 \n23 \nLiberty National\n75,170 \n53 \n79,181 \n56 \n(4,011)\n(5)\nAmerican Income\n53,553 \n57 \n49,124 \n53 \n4,429 \n9 \nDirect to Consumer\n1,527 \n3 \n3,935 \n7 \n(2,408)\n(61)\nTotal\n \n$\n291,152 \n26 \n$\n281,221 \n27 \n$\n9,931 \n4 \n73\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nGlobe Life markets supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels.

First-year collected premium from Medicare Supplement policies make up the remaining $54.4 million, or 31%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $46.1 million, or 28%, in the same period in the prior year.\nA discussion of health operations by distribution channel follows.\nThe \nUnited American Division\n consists of non-exclusive independent agencies who may also sell for other companies. The United American Division was Globe Life's largest health agency in terms of health premium income, with net sales up 55% from the same period in the prior year. \nThis Division includes different units:\n•\nUA General Agency, which primarily sells individual Medicare Supplement insurance through independent agents;\n•\nSpecial Markets, which markets retiree health insurance to employer and union groups through brokers; and\n•\nGlobe Life Group Benefits, which offers group worksite supplemental health insurance through brokers. \nThe majority of the premium revenue comes from Medicare Supplement. Underwriting margin as a percent of premium for the Division was 6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 10% for the same period in 2024. The decline in underwriting margin as a percent of premium when compared to prior year is primarily attributable \nto increased claims utilization during the current year from Medicare Supplement. We adjust premium rates based upon an annual review of utilization and claim cost trends and submit revisions for approval to the insurance department regulators and the new premium rates generally become effective in the following year.\nThe \nFamily Heritage Division\n is an exclusive agency that primarily markets individual limited-benefit supplemental health insurance to small- to medium-sized businesses. Most of its policies include a return of premium feature, where premium paid is returned less any claims paid to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. Underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 34% for the same period in the prior year.\nThe Division experienced a 13% rise in health net sales as compared with the same nine-month period a year ago, primarily due to increased agent count and increased agent productivity. The Division will continue to implement incentive and retention programs to further these increases in the number of producing agents.\n75\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nBelow is the average producing agent count at the end of the period for the Family Heritage Division. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the beginning and end of each week during the year. The average producing agent count increased 9% compared with the same period a year ago. Along with the Division's increased efforts to grow agent count, it is also focused on the further training and development of its agency middle management. While growth in net sales and earned premium is impacted by agent productivity, growth in the number of producing agents will be the primary driver of future growth in sales, similar to our other exclusive agencies. \nAt September 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n%\nFamily Heritage\n1,489 \n1,362 \n127 \n9 \nThe \nLiberty National Division\n represented 13% of all Globe Life health premium income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The Liberty National Division markets limited-benefit supplemental health products, consisting primarily of cancer, critical illness, and accident insurance. Much of Liberty National's health business is generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses. Health premium at the Liberty National Division was $142.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 up slightly from $142.6 million for the same period in 2024. Liberty National's first-year collected premium fell 2% to $20.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with $21.3 million for the same period in 2024. Health net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 fell 1% from the comparable period in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 53%, compared with 56% in the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in policy obligations in the current period.\nWhile both the \nAmerican Income Life Division\n and the \nDirect to Consumer Division \nsell life insurance, they also market health products. The American Income Life Division primarily markets accident plans. The Direct to Consumer Division primarily markets Medicare Supplement insurance to employer or union-sponsored groups. On a combined basis, these other channels accounted for 13% of health premium for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 14% for the same period in 2024.\nINVESTMENTS\nWe manage our capital resources, including investments and cash flow, through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in \nNote 12—Business Segments\n. It is defined as net investment income less the required interest attributable to policy liabilities.\nManagement views excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. \n76\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nExcess Investment Income\n.\n The following table summarizes Globe Life's investment income, excess investment income, and excess investment income per diluted common share.\nAnalysis of Excess Investment Income\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per share data)\n \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n%\nNet investment income\n$\n848,796 \n$\n853,178 \n$\n(4,382)\n(1)\nInterest on policy liabilities\n(1)\n(741,215)\n(727,099)\n(14,116)\n2 \nExcess investment income\n \n$\n107,581 \n$\n126,079 \n$\n(18,498)\n(15)\nExcess investment income per diluted share\n \n$\n1.29 \n$\n1.38 \n$\n(0.09)\n(7)\nMean invested assets (at amortized cost)\n$\n21,507,145 \n$\n21,359,702 \n$\n147,443 \n1 \nAverage insurance policy liabilities\n17,807,273 \n17,501,496 \n305,777 \n2 \n(1)\nInterest on policy liabilities, at original rates, is a component of total policyholder benefits, a GAAP measure. \nExcess investment income\n declined $18 million, or 15%, compared with the year-ago period. Excess investment income per diluted common share was $1.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of 7% from the prior-year period. Excess investment income per diluted common share generally increases or decreases  at a different pace than excess investment income because the number of diluted shares outstanding generally decreases from year to year as a result of our share repurchase program. \nNet investment income\n for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $849 million, or 1% less than the year-ago period. Mean invested assets increased 1% during the first nine months of 2025 over the same period last year. Net investment income declined in the current period \ndue to low growth in invested assets as a result of the impact of reinsurance transactions \nas well as higher dividend distributions from the insurance companies to the Parent. In addition,\n the Company reported lower earned yields on short-term investments, commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships\n compared to the prior year. The effective annual yield rate earned on the fixed maturity portfolio was 5.27% in the first nine months of 2025, compared to 5.26% a year earlier. In addition to fixed maturities, the Company has also invested in commercial mortgage loans and limited partnerships with debt-like characteristics that diversify risk and enhance risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns on the portfolio. The earned yield on the Company's commercial mortgage loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 6.11% compared with 8.47% in the prior year period. The lower earned yield on commercial mortgage loans is partly due to lower floating rates in addition to loans in non-accrual status. The earned yield on limited partnership investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 7.99% and 8.64% in the comparable prior-year period. See additional information in \nNote 4—Investments\n. \nGlobe Life's net investment income benefits from higher interest rates on new investments. While increasing interest rates have resulted in a net unrealized loss from our available-for-sale debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2025, we are not concerned because we do not generally intend to sell, nor is it likely that we will be required to sell, the fixed maturities prior to their anticipated recovery. \nRequired interest on insurance policy liabilities\n reduces excess investment income, as it is the amount of net investment income necessary to cover the interest-related growth on insurance policy liabilities. As such, it is reclassified from the insurance segment to the investment segment. As discussed in \nNote 12—Business Segments\n,\n management regards this as a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. Required interest is based on the original discount rate assumptions for our insurance policies in force. \nThe vast majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current GAAP accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the original discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability for all insurance policies issued that year. The liability reported on the balance sheet is updated in \n77\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nsubsequent periods using current discount rates as of the end of the relevant reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. \nThe discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years, as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in for purposes of recognizing income. As such, the overall original discount rate for the entire in force block of 5.5% is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves on the entire block of in force business. Business issued in the current year has little impact on the overall weighted-average original discount rate due to the size of our in force business.  \nIn comparison to the year-ago period, required interest on insurance policy liabilities increased $14 million, or 2%, to $741 million, consistent with the 2% growth in average interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities.\nRealized Gains and Losses.\n \nOur life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid for many years or even decades in the future. Since benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support these obligations. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations. \nDespite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time, investments are occasionally sold, exchanged, called, or experience a credit loss event, resulting in a realized gain or loss. Gains or losses are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders. The Company also has investments in certain limited partnerships, held under the fair value option, with fair value changes recognized in \nRealized gains (losses)\n in the \nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n.\n \nRealized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.\nThe following table summarizes our tax-effected realized gains (losses) by component.\nAnalysis of Realized Gains (Losses), Net of Tax\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per share data)\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \nAmount\nPer Share\nAmount\nPer Share \nFixed maturities:\nSales\n$\n(9,670)\n$\n(0.12)\n$\n(7,693)\n$\n(0.08)\nMatured or other redemptions\n(1)\n(9,080)\n(0.11)\n17 \n— \nProvision for credit losses\n(17)\n— \n(13)\n— \nFair value option—change in fair value\n(116)\n— \n(17,994)\n(0.20)\nMortgages\n(3,333)\n(0.04)\n(2,788)\n(0.03)\nOther investments\n(1,953)\n(0.02)\n897 \n0.01 \nTotal realized gains (losses)—investments\n \n(24,169)\n(0.29)\n(27,574)\n(0.30)\nOther gains (losses)\n(2)\n5,623 \n0.07 \n6,576 \n0.07 \nTotal realized gains (losses)\n \n$\n(18,546)\n$\n(0.22)\n$\n(20,998)\n$\n(0.23)\n(1)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded $128.5 million and $82.2 million, respectively, of exchanges of fixed maturity securities (noncash transactions) that resulted in a realized losses of $(2.3) million and $0 net of tax, respectively.\n(2)\nOther realized gains (losses) are primarily a result of changes in the fair value for assets held in rabbi trust. \n78\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nInvestment Acquisitions\n. \nGlobe Life's investment policy calls for investing primarily in investment grade fixed maturities that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally invest in securities with longer-term maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our life and health policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate since our expected future cash flows are generally stable and predictable and the likelihood that we will need to sell invested assets to raise cash is low. \nThe following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity investments. The effective annual yield shown is based on the acquisition price and call features, if any, of the securities. For non-callable bonds, the yield is calculated to maturity date. For callable bonds acquired at a premium, the yield is calculated to the earliest known call date and call price after acquisition (\"first call date\"). For all other callable bonds, the yield is calculated to maturity date.\nFixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nCost of acquisitions:\nInvestment-grade corporate securities\n$\n617,929 \n$\n967,372 \nInvestment-grade municipal securities\n113,496 \n11,231 \nOther securities\n56,005 \n26,062 \nTotal fixed maturity acquisitions\n(1)\n \n$\n787,430 \n$\n1,004,665 \nEffective annual yield (one year compounded)\n(2)\n6.39 \n%\n5.96 \n%\nAverage life (in years, to next call)\n30.8 \n29.9 \nAverage life (in years, to maturity)\n35.1 \n32.7 \nAverage rating\nA\nA-\n(1)\nFixed maturity acquisitions included unsettled trades of $15 million in 2025 and $4 million in 2024.\n(2)\nTax-equivalent basis, where the yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities.\nFor investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. Absent sales and \"make-whole calls,\" however, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.\nAcquisitions in 2025 and 2024 consisted primarily of corporate and municipal bonds with securities spanning a diversified range of issuers, industry sectors, and geographical regions. In the first nine months of 2025, we invested primarily in the industrial, financial, and utility sectors. For the entire portfolio, the taxable equivalent effective yield earned was 5.27%, up approximately 1 basis point from the yield in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in taxable equivalent effective yield was primarily due to new purchases at yields exceeding the yield on dispositions and the average portfolio yield.

The remainder of the portfolio is invested primarily in securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. municipalities. The Company holds insignificant amounts in foreign government bonds, asset-backed securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers. At September 30, 2025, the total fixed maturity portfolio consisted of 1,012 issuers.\nFixed maturities had a fair value of $17.8 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $17.2 billion at December 31, 2024. The net unrealized loss position in the fixed-maturity portfolio decreased from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024 to $1.1 billion at September 30, 2025 due to a change in market rates during the period. \nFor more information about our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, including a discussion of allowance for credit losses, an analysis of unrealized investment losses, and a schedule of maturities, see \nNote 4—Investments\n.\nAn analysis of the fixed-maturity portfolio by composite quality rating at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, is shown in the following tables. \nThe company uses the NAIC designation for credit quality ratings. The NAIC designation is generally determined using the second lowest rating available from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSRO”) when three or more ratings are available and the lowest rating when two or fewer rating are available.

Fixed maturities rated BBB are 43% of the total portfolio at September 30, 2025, down from 46% at December 31, 2024. While this ratio is high relative to our peers, it is at its lowest level since 2006 and we have limited exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, and asset-backed securities. Additionally, the Company does not participate in securities lending and has no off-balance sheet investments as of September 30, 2025. Of our fixed maturity purchases, BBB securities generally provide the Company with the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns largely due to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.\nAn analysis of changes in our portfolio of below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses is as follows:\nBelow-Investment Grade Fixed Maturities\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\nBalance at beginning of period\n \n$\n529,120 \n$\n529,511 \nDowngrades by rating agencies\n69,109 \n35,312 \nUpgrades by rating agencies\n(30,565)\n— \nDispositions\n(124,940)\n(12,558)\nAcquisitions\n20,033 \n— \nProvision for credit losses\n(20)\n(17)\nAmortization and other\n(7,514)\n3,615 \nBalance at end of period\n \n$\n455,223 \n$\n555,863 \n84\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nOur investment policy calls for investing primarily in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives. Thus, the balance of below-investment grade issues is primarily the result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings. Below-investment grade bonds at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, were 2% of total fixed maturities at amortized cost as of September 30, 2025. \nOPERATING EXPENSES \nOperating expenses are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the Parent Company. Insurance administrative expenses generally include expenses incurred after a policy has been issued. As these expenses relate to premium for a given period, management measures the expenses as a percentage of premium income. The Company also views stock-based compensation expense as a Parent Company expense. Expenses associated with the issuance of our insurance policies are reflected as acquisition expenses and included in the determination of underwriting margin.\nAn analysis of operating expenses is shown below.\nOperating Expenses Selected Information\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\nIncrease\n \n2025\n2024\n(Decrease)\nAmount\n% of\nPremium\nAmount\n% of\nPremium\nAmount\n%\nInsurance administrative expenses:\nSalaries\n$\n102,630 \n2.8 \n$\n95,406 \n2.7 \n$\n7,224 \n8 \nOther employee costs\n29,764 \n0.8 \n28,531 \n0.8 \n1,233 \n4 \nInformation technology costs\n62,286 \n1.7 \n59,023 \n1.7 \n3,263 \n6 \nLegal costs\n16,930 \n0.5 \n19,771 \n0.6 \n(2,841)\n(14)\nOther administrative costs\n51,753 \n1.4 \n48,341 \n1.4 \n3,412 \n7 \nTotal insurance administrative expenses\n263,363 \n7.2 \n251,072 \n7.2 \n12,291 \n5 \nParent company expense\n10,710 \n9,166 \n1,544 \nStock compensation expense\n40,665 \n28,590 \n12,075 \nLegal proceedings\n13,365 \n5,764 \n7,601 \nOther expenses\n498 \n2,604 \n(2,106)\nTotal operating expenses, per \nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n \n$\n328,601 \n$\n297,196 \n$\n31,405 \n11 \nTotal operating expenses for September 30, 2025 increased in comparison with the prior year primarily due to increases in insurance administrative expenses as well as stock compensation and legal proceedings. Insurance administrative expenses increased $12 million primarily due to higher employee costs, which include salaries and other costs. Insurance administrative expenses as a percent of premium were 7.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 7.2% for the same period in 2024. Stock compensation expense increased primarily due to changes in the mix of awards and increase in award values.\n85\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nSHARE REPURCHASES\nGlobe Life has an ongoing share repurchase program that began in 1986. The share repurchase program is reviewed with the Board of Directors quarterly, and continues indefinitely unless and until the Board of Directors decides to suspend, terminate or modify the program. On November 18, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.8 billion under the Company's existing share repurchase program. Management generally determines the amount of repurchases based on the amount of excess cash flows and other available sources after the payment of dividends to the Parent Company shareholders, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. At September 30, 2025, we had slightly more than $1.2 billion remaining under the authorization to repurchase. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used $10.8 billion to repurchase Globe Life Inc. common shares, after determining that the repurchases provide a greater risk-adjusted after-tax return than other investment alternatives. \nExcess cash flow at the Parent Company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt and other limited operating activities. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the resulting tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. \nThe following table summarizes share repurchases for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nAnalysis of Share Repurchases\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n \n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n Purchases with:\nShares\nAmount\nAverage\nPrice\nShares\nAmount\nAverage\nPrice\nExcess cash flow at the Parent Company\n(1)\n4,157 \n$\n515,340 \n$\n123.97 \n9,748 \n$\n910,040 \n$\n93.36 \nOption exercise proceeds\n1,316 \n168,818 \n128.34 \n348 \n31,454 \n90.30 \nTotal\n5,473 \n$\n684,158 \n$\n125.02 \n10,096 \n$\n941,494 \n$\n93.25 \n(1)\nExcludes excise tax on the repurchase of treasury stock of $4.6 million and $9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n \nLiquidity. \nLiquidity provides Globe Life with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required to support our business operations and meet our financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from multiple sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, a revolving credit facility, commercial paper, and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nInsurance Subsidiary Liquidity\n. \nThe operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Cash inflows for the insurance subsidiaries primarily include premium and investment income. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are cash inflows. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. A portion of cash inflows in the current year will provide for the payment of future policy benefits and are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities as they better match the long-term nature of these obligations. The subsidiary dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. While the insurance subsidiaries annually generate more operating cash inflows than cash outflows, the companies also have the entire available-for-sale fixed-maturity investment portfolio available to create additional cash flows if required.\nFour of our insurance subsidiaries are members of the FHLB of Dallas. FHLB membership provides the insurance subsidiaries with access to various low-cost collateralized borrowings and funding agreements. While not the only \n86\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nsource of liquidity, the FHLB could provide the insurance subsidiaries with an additional source of liquidity, if needed. Refer to \nNote 11—Debt\n for further details.\nParent Company Liquidity.\n An important source of Parent Company liquidity is the dividends from its insurance subsidiaries. These dividends are received throughout the year and are used by the Parent Company to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayment requirements on Parent Company debt, and operating expenses of the Parent Company. \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nTwelve Months Ended \nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nProjected 2025\n2024\nLiquidity Sources:\nDividends from Subsidiaries\n$\n482,091 \n$\n451,416 \n$780,000—$830,000\n$\n692,690 \nExcess Cash Flows\n(1)\n$\n590,006 \n$\n412,626 \n$860,000—$920,000\n$\n455,013 \n(1)\nExcess cash flows are reported gross of shareholder dividends. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, shareholder dividends were $64 million and $65 million, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, we project approximately $85 million in shareholder dividends, compared to the $85 million paid in 2024. \nDividends from subsidiaries and excess cash flows are projected to be higher in 2025 than in 2024 primarily due to improved earnings from favorable mortality trends and growth in business, as well as positive impacts from lower reserve increases under statutory accounting impacting the 2024 statutory earnings that derive the 2025 dividends. The excess cash flows in 2025 include the extraordinary dividends approved in the latter part of 2024 of $192 million. Additional sources of liquidity for the Parent Company are cash, intercompany receivables, intercompany borrowings, debt markets, term loans, and a revolving credit facility.\nOn July 1, 2025, we entered into a 30-year facility agreement (“Facility Agreement”) with a Delaware Trust (the “Trust”) formed by us in connection with the sale by the trust of $500 million pre-capitalized trust securities redeemable May 15, 2055 in a Rule 144A private placement. The Trust invested the proceeds from the sale of its securities in a portfolio of principal and interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities (the “Strips”).\nThe Facility Agreement provides us with the right to sell at any time to the Trust up to $500 million of our 6.580% Senior Notes due 2055 (the “6.580% Senior Notes”) in exchange for a corresponding amount of the Strips held by the Trust (the “Issuance Right”). We agreed to pay a semi-annual facility fee of 1.789% per annum on the unexercised portion of the Issuance \nThe Issuance Right will be exercised automatically in full upon (i) our failure to pay the facility fee or to purchase any Strips required to be purchased under the Facility, if the failure to pay is not cured within 30 days, or (ii) certain bankruptcy events involving the Company. We are also required to exercise the Issuance Right in full if our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding AOCI) falls below $1.85 billion, subject to certain adjustments.\nThe Company can redeem the 6.580% Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the greater of par or a make-whole redemption price. At September 30, 2025, the Company had no senior note issuances under the Facility Agreement.\nShort-Term Borrowings. \nAn additional source of Parent Company liquidity is a credit facility with a group of lenders. The facility was amended on March 29, 2024, resulting in an increased capacity of $250 million. The facility allows for unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $1 billion, which could be increased up to $1.25 billion. While the Parent Company may request the increase, it is not guaranteed. The updated five-year credit agreement will mature on March 29, 2029. Up to $250 million in letters of credit can be issued against the facility. The facility serves as a backup line of credit for a commercial paper program under which commercial paper may be issued at any time, with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed the facility maximum less any letters of credit issued. Interest charged on the commercial paper program resembles variable rate debt due to its short term nature. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had available $554 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility, compared to $458 million a year earlier. As of September 30, 2025, the Parent Company was in full compliance with all covenants related to the aforementioned debt.\n87\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGlobe Life Inc.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nAs a part of the credit facility, Globe Life has stand-by letters of credits. These letters of credit are issued on behalf of our insurance subsidiaries.\nThe following tables present certain information about our commercial paper borrowings.\nCredit Facility—Commercial Paper\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nAt\nSeptember 30,\n2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nBalance of commercial paper at end of period (par value)\n$\n331,000 \n$\n419,000 \n$\n426,908 \nAnnualized interest rate\n4.60 \n%\n5.22 \n%\n5.56 \n%\nLetters of credit outstanding\n$\n115,000 \n$\n115,000 \n$\n115,000 \nRemaining amount available under credit line\n554,000 \n466,000 \n458,092 \nCredit Facility—Commercial Paper Activity\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nAverage balance of commercial paper outstanding during period (par value)\n$\n430,732 \n$\n375,851 \nDaily-weighted average interest rate (annualized)\n4.90 \n%\n5.80 \n%\nMaximum daily amount outstanding during period (par value)\n$\n605,500 \n$\n633,425 \nThe Company reduced commercial paper borrowings by $88 million since year end. The Company was able to issue commercial paper as needed under this facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. \nGlobe Life expects to have readily available funds for 2025 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through liquid assets currently available, internally-generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the event more liquidity is needed, the Parent Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of debt, an additional short-term credit facility or term loan, and intercompany borrowing.\nConsolidated Liquidity.\n Consolidated net cash inflows from operations were $1.05 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared with $1.07 billion in the same period of 2024. The decrease is attributable to routine fluctuations in the settlement of operating activities. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our insurance companies received proceeds from dispositions of fixed maturities available for sale, mortgage loans, and other long-term investments in the amount of $776 million during the first nine months of 2025. The Parent Company has in place a revolving credit facility and a P-CAPS facility. See\n Note 11—Debt\n for further details. The insurance companies have no additional outstanding credit facilities. \nCash and short-term investments were $366 million at September 30, 2025, compared with $250 million at December 31, 2024. In addition to these liquid assets, $18 billion (fair value at September 30, 2025) of fixed income securities are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. Approximately $1.3 billion, at fair value, are pledged for outstanding FHLB advances and reinsurance. Further, approximately 98% of our fixed income securities are publicly traded, freely tradable under SEC Rule 144, or qualified for resale under SEC Rule 144A. While our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale, we have the ability and general intent to hold any securities to recovery or maturity. Our strong cash flows from operations, on-going investment maturities, and available liquidity under our credit facility make any need to sell securities for liquidity highly unlikely. \nCapital Resources.\n \nThe Parent Company's capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility and current maturities of long-term debt)\n,\n long-term debt, and shareholders’ equity.

Other financing costs increased due to the P-CAPS facility fee. More information on our debt transactions is disclosed in the \nFinancial Condition\n section of this report.\nSubsidiary Capital\n: \nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has established a risk-based factor approach for determining threshold risk-based capital levels for all insurance companies. This approach was designed to assist the regulatory bodies in identifying companies that may require regulatory attention. A Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio is typically determined by dividing adjusted total statutory capital by the amount of RBC determined using the NAIC’s factors. If a company’s RBC ratio approaches two times the RBC amount, the company must file a plan with the NAIC for improving its capital levels (this level is commonly referred to as “Company Action Level” RBC). Companies typically hold a multiple of the Company Action Level RBC depending on their particular business needs and risk profile.\nOur goal is to maintain statutory capital within our insurance subsidiaries at levels necessary to support our current ratings. For 2025, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated Company Action Level RBC ratio of 300% to 320%. The Company has concluded that this capital level is more than adequate and sufficient to support its current ratings, given the nature of its business and its risk profile. For 2024, our consolidated Company Action Level RBC ratio was 316%. The Parent Company is committed to maintaining the targeted consolidated RBC ratio at its insurance subsidiaries and has sufficient liquidity available to provide additional capital if necessary.\nShareholders' Equity\n:\n Shareholders’ equity was $5.7 billion at September 30, 2025. This compares with $5.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and $4.6 billion at September 30, 2024. During the nine months since December 31, 2024, shareholders’ equity increased as a result of net income of $895 million during the first nine months of 2025, but was offset by share repurchases of $515 million and an additional $169 million in share repurchases to offset the dilution from stock option exercises. Additionally, the change in the balance of AOCI increased shareholders' equity $57 million primarily due to changes in  interest rates and discount rates over the period. \nOn August 7, 2025, the Parent Company announced that it had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share. This dividend was paid on October 31, 2025. \nWe plan to use excess cash available at the Parent Company as efficiently as possible in the future. Excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the Parent Company from its insurance subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt. The cash received by the Parent Company from our insurance subsidiaries is after they have made substantial investments during the year to grow the business. Possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to, share repurchases, acquisitions, shareholder dividend payments, investments in securities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our insurance subsidiaries. If market conditions are favorable, we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.\nFuture policy benefits are computed using current discount rates with the impact of changes in discount rates included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Additionally, the liability for future policy benefits is calculated using net premiums rather than gross premiums. Given that gross premiums are considerably higher than net premiums for our business, as seen in \nNote 6—Policy Liabilities\n, the measurement of the liability is higher than what it would be had it been computed using gross premiums. This is an important consideration when analyzing shareholders' equity.\nWe maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policy liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in market rates. \nWhile a majority of invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity, an inconsistency exists in measurement, which may have a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders’ equity, capital structure, and financial ratios. Due to the long-term nature of our fixed-maturity investments and liabilities \n90\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nand the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by market rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.\n91\n                                         GL Q3 2025 FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents"
