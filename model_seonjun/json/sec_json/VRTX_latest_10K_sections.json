We have seven approved medicines: five that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (“CF”), a life-threatening genetic disease, one that treats severe sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (“TDT”), life shortening inherited blood disorders, and one that treats moderate-to-severe acute pain. Our clinical-stage pipeline includes programs in CF, SCD, beta thalassemia, acute and peripheral neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, IgA nephropathy and other autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, type 1 diabetes, myotonic dystrophy type 1, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.\nOur goal in CF is to continue to extend our leadership by developing treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all people with CF. In December 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved ALYFTREK (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor), our fifth medicine for people with CF. In addition to ALYFTREK, our marketed medicines that treat people with CF are TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and KALYDECO (ivacaftor). Collectively, our five marketed CF medicines are being used to treat nearly three quarters of the approximately 94,000 people with CF in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada. \nThrough approval of new medicines, label expansions, and expanded reimbursement, we are focused on increasing the number of people with CF who are eligible and able to receive our medicines. We are evaluating our current medicines in additional patient populations, including younger children, with the goal of having small molecule treatments for all people who have at least one mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene that is responsive to our CFTR modulators. In December 2024, the FDA approved the expanded use of TRIKAFTA for treatment of people with CF. With this approval, 94 additional non-F508del CFTR mutations have been added to the TRIKAFTA label. \nWe are evaluating VX-522, an investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”) therapeutic that we are developing in collaboration with Moderna, Inc. (“Moderna”) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in people with CF. The multiple ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing, and we expect to share data in the first half of 2025. VX-522 has the potential to benefit the more than 5,000 people with CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia who do not make full-length CFTR protein and therefore cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. In addition, \nwe are continuing our research and development of additional CFTR modulators, with the aim of developing best-in-class medicines that can help more patients achieve normal levels of CFTR function, and we are investigating additional potential treatments for people with CF who do not make full-length CFTR protein and cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. \nIn SCD and TDT, our goal is to\n eliminate vaso-occlusive crises (“VOCs”) (as well as vaso-occlusive organ damage) and transfusion dependence, respectively. Our marketed therapy is CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel), an ex-vivo, non-viral CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy, which has been approved in the United States (“U.S.”), the European Union (“E.U.”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (“Saudi Arabia”), the Kingdom of Bahrain (“Bahrain”), the United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”), Canada and Switzerland for treatment of people 12 years of age and older with SCD or TDT. We estimate approximately 60,000 people with severe SCD or TDT are or could become eligible for CASGEVY in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. We are evaluating CASGEVY as a treatment for children 5 to 11 years of age with SCD or TDT in global Phase 3 clinical trials. We are progressing preclinical assets for gentler conditioning for CASGEVY, which could broaden the eligible patient population, and investigating small molecules for the potential treatment of SCD and TDT. \nIn January 2025, the FDA approved JOURNAVX (suzetrigine), our selective non-opioid NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. We have begun our commercial launch of JOURNAVX in eligible adults in the U.S. In addition, we are enrolling and dosing patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating suzetrigine for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain. We are enrolling and dosing patients in two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating VX-993, a next-generation selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of acute pain and for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In December 2024, we announced results from a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating suzetrigine in people with lumbosacral radiculopathy (“LSR”). Treatment with suzetrigine \n1\ndemonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful within-group reduction in pain and we plan to advance to pivotal development in LSR, pending discussions with regulators. \nThe following chart sets forth our approved products, clinical-stage programs, and select pre-clinical programs:\nBeyond CF, SCD, TDT and pain, we are advancing programs across multiple disease areas and modalities, including: \n•\nAPOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease. \nWe are evaluating inaxaplin, our small molecule for the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney disease (“AMKD”)\n. We continue to enroll and dose people with AMKD in the Phase 3 portion of the global Phase 2/3 clinical trial.\n•\nIgA Nephropathy\n. We are developing povetacicept, a dual inhibitor of the B cell activating factor (“BAFF”) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (“APRIL”) pathways, as a potentially best-in-class approach to treat IgA nephropathy (“IgAN”), a serious progressive, autoimmune kidney disease that can lead to end-stage renal disease. We are enrolling and dosing patients in the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating povetacicept in people with IgAN.\n•\nType 1 Diabetes. Z\nimislecel, formerly known as VX-880, is an allogeneic stem-cell derived, fully differentiated islet cell therapy in pivotal development for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (“T1D”). We expect to complete enrollment and dosing in the Phase 3 portion of this Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial in 2025. Our second clinical program in T1D, VX-264, in which zimislecel is encapsulated in an immunoprotective device, is ongoing. We are also pursuing alternative approaches to immunosuppression that could be used with zimislecel, as well as hypoimmune cells.\n•\nMyotonic Dystrophy Type 1. \nWe are exploring multiple approaches to address the underlying causal biology for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (“DM1”), including small molecules. We completed the single ascending dose portion of the global Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating VX-670, an oligonucleotide-based approach that we have in-licensed from Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. (“Entrada”). We are enrolling and dosing the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-670.\n•\nAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\n. We are nearing completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating VX-407, our first-in-class small molecule corrector that targets the underlying cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (“ADPKD”) in people with a subset of variants in the PKD1 gene. We expect to advance VX-407 into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in people with ADPKD in 2025.\n•\nIn addition to the programs listed above, we have additional research programs aimed at diseases that fit our research and development strategy and follow-on programs in our existing disease areas in accord with our serial innovation approach.\n2\nOur core strategy is to discover and develop innovative medicines by combining transformative advances in the understanding of human disease and the science of therapeutics to dramatically advance human health. That strategy focuses on validated targets that address causal human biology, predictive lab assays and clinical biomarkers, rapid paths to registration and approval, and product candidates that hold the potential for transformative patient benefit. Our approach includes advancing multiple compounds or therapies from each program into early clinical trials to obtain patient data that can inform selection of the most promising therapies for later stage development as well as inform our ongoing discovery and development efforts. We aim to rapidly follow our first-in-class therapies that achieve proof-of-concept with potential best-in-class candidates. We plan to continue investing to advance our strategy, fostering scientific innovation by identifying additional product candidates through internal research efforts, and investing in business development transactions to access emerging technologies, products and product candidates. \nOur serial innovation approach is intended to increase the likelihood of successfully bringing transformative medicines to patients and to provide durable clinical and commercial success. Our CF medicines are the exemplar of this strategy, as we continue to reach more people with CF than ever before through approvals of new medicines, approvals in new geographies, label expansions, including for younger patients, and expanded reimbursement. In addition, we have diversified our business through the approvals for CASGEVY for the treatment of SCD and TDT and through the approval for JOURNAVX for the treatment of acute pain. We are working to ensure broad access for eligible patients with these conditions in all countries with regulatory approval. Within our clinical pipeline, we have rapidly progressed multiple programs into pivotal development during the last year. As we continue to invest in our serial innovation strategy, launch new products, advance our diverse pipeline, and expand geographically, we continue to maintain a strong financial profile.\n3\nMARKETED PRODUCTS\nInformation regarding our marketed products, including information regarding the disease area, initial approval and age group for which the therapy is approved, are set forth in the table below.\nDisease\nInitial Approval\nEligible Age Group\n(1)\nCystic Fibrosis\n2024\n6 years of age and older\n2019\n2 years of age and older\n2020\n2 years of age and older\n2018\n6 years of age and older\n2018\n6 years of age and older\n2015\n1 year of age and older\n2012\n1 month of age and older\nSickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia\n2023\n12 years of age and older\nAcute Pain\n \n2025\nadults\n(1) \nSpecifies the youngest eligible age group in any major market. \nCF\nOur CF medicines are collectively being used by nearly three quarters of the approximately 94,000 people with CF in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada. Additionally, we continue to secure formal reimbursement in multiple additional countries that collectively comprise approximately 15,000 additional people with CF. Approximately 10,000 of those additional people with CF are eligible for treatment with CFTR modulators. We previously served many of these markets through named patient sales.\n4\nCF is a life-shortening genetic disease caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. To develop CF, children must inherit two defective CFTR genes, which are referred to as alleles; one allele is inherited from each parent. The vast majority of patients with CF carry at least one F508del mutation. The F508del mutation results in a defect in the CFTR protein in which the CFTR protein does not reach the surface of the cells in sufficient quantities and does not adequately transport chloride ions. \nThe absence of working CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of cells in a number of organs, including the lungs. As a result, thick, sticky mucus builds up and blocks the passages in many organs, leading to a variety of symptoms. In particular, mucus builds up and clogs the airways in the lungs, causing chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage. CFTR potentiators, such as ivacaftor and deutivacaftor, increase the probability that the CFTR protein channels open on the cell surface, increasing the flow of salt and water into and out of the cell. CFTR correctors, such as lumacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor and vanzacaftor, increase the proper protein processing and folding of mutant CFTR proteins, such that a larger amount of functional CFTR protein reaches the cell surface. Our CFTR regimens target the underlying cause of disease and have been shown to improve CFTR protein function in people with CF, and as such have been shown to provide transformative benefit for people living with CF. \nOur CF medicines are used by patients in over 60 countries, and TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO is approved and reimbursed or accessible in more than 50 of these countries. We continue to increase the number of patients eligible and able to receive our current medicines through approvals of new medicines, label expansions and expanded reimbursement. In December 2024, the FDA approved the expanded use of TRIKAFTA for the treatment of people with CF 2 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or a mutation that is responsive to TRIKAFTA based on clinical and/or in vitro data. With this approval, 94 additional non-F508del CFTR mutations have been added to the TRIKAFTA label.\nIn December 2024, the FDA approved ALYFTREK for the treatment of people with CF 6 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation or another mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ALYFTREK. ALYFTREK is our next-in-class triple combination, which has the benefit of a once-daily dosing regimen and demonstrated non-inferiority to TRIKAFTA in ppFEV\n1\n, a measure of lung function, and an improvement in sweat chloride levels as compared to TRIKAFTA. ALYFTREK carries a lower royalty burden than our other approved CF medicines and is also approved for 31 additional mutations not responsive to other CFTR modulator therapies. \nSickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia \nCASGEVY, our therapy for SCD and TDT, is approved in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Canada and Switzerland. SCD and TDT are hemoglobinopathies, a group of inherited blood disorders that result from gene mutations that alter hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen throughout the body. We estimate approximately 60,000 people with severe SCD or TDT are or could become eligible for CASGEVY in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. \nSCD is caused by the change of a single amino acid in the β-hemoglobin gene that causes red cells to change shape in settings of low oxygen. These sickled cells block blood flow and can lead to severe pain (known as vaso-occlusive crises), organ damage, and shortened life span. Treatment is typically focused on relieving pain and minimizing organ damage, requiring medication and, for some patients, monthly blood transfusions and frequent hospital visits. \nBeta thalassemia is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the same β-hemoglobin gene that lead to severe anemia in patients, which causes fatigue and shortness of breath. In infants, beta thalassemia causes failure to thrive, jaundice, and feeding problems. Complications of beta thalassemia can lead to an enlarged spleen, liver and/or heart, misshapen bones and delayed puberty. Treatment for beta thalassemia varies depending on the disease severity for each patient. Patients with TDT, the most severe form of the disease, require regular blood transfusions, as frequently as every two to four weeks. Repeated blood transfusions eventually cause an unhealthy buildup of iron in the patient, leading to organ damage. \nCASGEVY, our ex-vivo, non-viral CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy, was developed for the treatment of severe SCD and TDT, with our collaborator, CRISPR Therapeutics AG (“CRISPR”). Patients first undergo a treatment at an authorized treatment center (“ATC”) that mobilizes a population of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (“HSPC”) from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. These cells are collected from the patient’s bloodstream and transferred to a manufacturing facility where the HSPCs are purified and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing is performed. The gene-editing procedure results in a precise and specific gene-edit in a non-coding intron of the BCL11A gene. Following manufacturing, the edited cells, now called CASGEVY, are transferred back to the ATC. Patients are preconditioned with a myeloablative \n5\nconditioning treatment that ablates their bone marrow prior to infusion of CASGEVY. After the edited HSPC cells are returned to the patient and engraft, the gene-edit results in significant increases in the levels of fetal hemoglobin erythrocytes, thereby reducing or eliminating symptoms associated with disease. Efficacy data support the profile of CASGEVY as a potential one-time functional cure for people with severe SCD and TDT. \nOur global launch strategy for CASGEVY continues to focus on countries with high unmet medical need and infrastructure to support treatment with this CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy, including the U.S., the Middle East, and major markets in Europe. We are working with ATCs to enable patient initiation, supporting the patient journey through infusion with CASGEVY, and working with payors to secure broad and equitable access for patients. With more than 50 ATCs activated globally, our strategy is focused on activation of a global ATC network to treat patients and expansion of our globally-enabled manufacturing and supply chain to meet growing patient demand. Our teams are also focused on working to educate patients, physicians and policymakers on the treatment journey and CASGEVY clinical data, where appropriate. \nAcute Pain \nAcute pain is a disabling condition that may occur suddenly but typically lasts less than 90 days and resolves in days or weeks (for example, following surgery or an injury). It is estimated that over 80 million people are prescribed a medicine for acute pain every year in the U.S. Currently available treatments have limitations around efficacy or side effects, including a risk of addiction. Because of these challenges, over- and under-utilization, as well as misutilization, of current pain medicines may occur. \nIn January 2025, the FDA approved JOURNAVX for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adults. The approval was based on two positive randomized controlled Phase 3 clinical trials and supported by a positive single arm Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating safety and effectiveness. JOURNAVX is a first-in-class, oral pain signal inhibitor that is highly selective for NaV1.8 voltage-gated sodium channels. Through this mechanism, JOURNAVX provides effective relief of pain without evidence of the limitations of other currently available therapies, including the addictive potential of opioids.\nOur launch strategy for JOURNAVX focuses on securing broad access for people with acute pain, educating patients and physicians on the clinical profile of JOURNAVX, and making investments to provide a seamless treatment experience for physicians and people with acute pain. We are engaging with payors and formulary decision makers to secure reimbursement and access to JOURNAVX. We are working to secure national retail distribution to facilitate broad availability of JOURNAVX as well as financial and co-pay assistance programs for patients that will support access to JOURNAVX. \nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\nWe invest in research and development to discover and develop transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. Our research strategy is to combine transformative advances in the understanding of human disease and in the science of therapeutics to dramatically advance human health. We focus on:\n•\ndisease areas with known causal human biology; \n•\ntargets validated by causal human biology;\n•\npredictive lab assays and clinical biomarkers;\n•\npotential for transformative benefit regardless of modality; and\n•\nefficient path to registration and approval.\nOur development-stage product candidates are focused on the treatment of serious diseases, including CF, SCD, TDT, acute and peripheral neuropathic pain, AMKD, IgAN and other autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, T1D, DM1, and ADPKD. In pursuit of serial innovation, our research and development approach includes advancing multiple candidates into clinical trials and pursuing multiple modalities with the goal of bringing first-in-class and/or best-in-class therapies to patients. \nOur research and development strategy has been validated through our success in moving novel product candidates into clinical trials and obtaining marketing approvals for ALYFTREK, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, and \n6\nSYMDEKO/SYMKEVI for the treatment of CF, CASGEVY for the treatment of SCD and TDT, and JOURNAVX for the treatment of acute pain. Our approach to drug discovery has been further validated by our successful demonstration of clinical proof-of-concept in four additional disease areas: in diabetic peripheral neuropathy with our NaV1.8 inhibitors, in AMKD with inaxaplin, in T1D with zimislecel, and in IgAN with povetacicept. \nOver the last several years, this strategy has led us to expand our capabilities to include additional innovative therapeutic modalities with a focus on cell and genetic therapies, which have the potential to treat, and in some cases, cure diseases by addressing the underlying cause of the disease. CASGEVY, approved in multiple geographies, including the U.S., is one such example. We continue to make significant internal investments in cell and genetic therapies. These investments include the development of a Boston-based campus for research and current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) clinical manufacturing capabilities dedicated to our portfolio of cell and genetic therapy technologies and teams. \n To augment our internal programs, we acquire businesses and technologies and collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations to advance research in our disease areas of interest, as well as to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy. Our internal and external innovation approaches are based on the same strategy, which enables us to effectively integrate and execute on new internal capabilities as we invest in external innovation. Our investments in external innovation include our collaboration with CRISPR, which resulted in the successful development and approval of CASGEVY and the establishment and advancement of other pipeline programs, including our T1D program through our acquisition of Semma Therapeutics, Inc. (“Semma”), our expansion of our renal programs through our acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (“Alpine”), our mRNA therapeutic, VX-522, for treatment of CF through our collaboration with Moderna, and our intracellular therapeutics for DM1, including VX-670, through our collaboration with Entrada.\nCF \nWe are enrolling and dosing in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ALYFTREK in children with CF 2 to 5 years of age who have at least one F508del mutation or a mutation responsive to triple combination CFTR modulators.\nWe estimate that approximately 90% of people with CF could benefit from our five approved medicines, including TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO and the recently approved ALYFTREK. We continue to identify and develop additional CFTR modulators with the goal of developing best-in-class medicines that can help more patients who respond to CFTR modulators achieve normal levels of CFTR function; our next generation of CFTR modulators have completed, or are in the process of completing, Phase 1 clinical trials.\nIn order to treat people with CF who do not make full-length CFTR protein, and as a result, cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators, we are researching and developing genetic therapies, such as mRNA, and gene-editing approaches to CF. In collaboration with Moderna, we are developing VX-522, a nebulized CF mRNA therapeutic designed to treat the underlying cause of CF lung disease for these people by enabling cells in the lungs to produce functional CFTR protein. \nThe multiple ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing and we expect data in the first half of 2025. We believe that VX-522 has the potential to benefit more than 5,000 people with CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia.\nSickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia \nTwo global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating CASGEVY in children 5 to 11 years of age with severe SCD (the CLIMB SCD-151 clinical trial) and TDT (the CLIMB THAL-141 clinical trial) are ongoing. \nWe have completed enrollment in these two clinical trials, and we expect to complete dosing in 2025. \nIn connection with our serial innovation approach, we are advancing preclinical assets for myeloablative conditioning agents with improved tolerability profiles, which we refer to as “gentler conditioning agents,” which could be used in connection with treatment with CASGEVY, significantly broadening the eligible SCD and TDT patient population. We are  also investigating in vivo gene-editing approaches and small molecules for the potential treatment of SCD and TDT.\nPain\nPain can be debilitating and develop from a variety of conditions. Most commonly, patients with pain can be categorized as suffering from one of three types of pain: acute pain, chronic neuropathic pain (caused primarily by damage or dysfunction of peripheral nerves), or chronic musculoskeletal pain (caused primarily by damage to muscle, joints or bone). Acute pain usually resolves in days or weeks (for example, following surgery or an injury), while chronic pain generally lasts greater \n7\nthan three months due to unresolved or ongoing damage to tissues or nerves. Currently available treatments have limitations around efficacy or side effects, including a risk of addiction. Because of these challenges, over- and under-utilization, as well as mis-utilization, of current pain medicines may occur. \nThe sodium channels NaV1.8 and NaV1.7 play important roles in the physiology of pain. We have discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8 as potential treatments for pain. We obtained pharmacological validation of NaV1.8 inhibition with a first generation NaV1.8 inhibitor in three clinical pain types: acute pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. \nIn acute pain, we are evaluating an oral formulation of VX-993, our next-generation NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain following bunionectomy surgery in a Phase 2 clinical trial. We are also enrolling and dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an intravenous formulation of VX-993. The FDA has granted Fast Track Designation to VX-993 in acute pain in both the oral and intravenous formulations. \nIn neuropathic \npain, we are enrolling and dosing in the Phase 3 pivotal program evaluating suzetrigine in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain, with the ultimate goal of securing a broad label for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. In addition, we are enrolling and dosing patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the oral formulation of VX-993, for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. There are no approved medicines in the U.S. that are labeled for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The FDA has granted suzetrigine Breakthrough Therapy Designation in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. \nIn support of this broad peripheral neuropathic pain indication we seek, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of suzetrigine for the treatment of people with LSR, which is pain caused by impairment or injury to nerve roots in the area of the lumbar spine, another type of peripheral neuropathic pain. In December 2024, we announced Phase 2 clinical trial results showing that treatment with suzetrigine demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful within-group reduction in pain on the numeric pain rating scale for people with LSR, and that suzetrigine was safe and generally well-tolerated in the trial. The clinical trial also included a placebo reference arm, which showed a similar within-group reduction. We hypothesize that a high placebo response in this clinical trial led to a lack of separation of the suzetrigine and placebo response curves. We believe we can innovate in pain clinical trial design to better control the placebo effect, and succeed in pivotal development with suzetrigine. We plan to advance suzetrigine into pivotal development in LSR, pending discussions with regulators on trial design and the regulatory package.\nIn keeping with our serial innovation approach, we are advancing multiple additional NaV1.8 inhibitors and NaV1.7 inhibitors, which could be used alone or in combination, for the treatment of acute pain and chronic neuropathic pain\n.\nAPOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease \nInherited mutations in the APOL1 gene play a causal role in the biology of severe proteinuric kidney diseases referred to as AMKD. In AMKD, the kidney’s filtering units known as the glomeruli, and within them the cells known as podocytes, are damaged, leading to leakage of protein into the urine, deterioration in kidney function, scarring, and, ultimately, permanent kidney damage. Patients with proteinuria who inherited two copies of the APOL1 mutations demonstrate rapid progression to end-stage kidney disease. Some patients with AMKD have the histological finding of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (“FSGS”) and co-morbidities such as hypertension. We are evaluating multiple novel small molecules that inhibit the function of the mutant APOL1 protein with the potential to treat APOL1-mediated kidney disease.\nIn a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial, patients with APOL1-mediated FSGS treated with inaxaplin on top of standard of care achieved a statistically significant, substantial, and clinically meaningful reduction of proteinuria, and inaxaplin was well tolerated by patients. Based on this positive Phase 2 data, we initiated pivotal development of inaxaplin in a single Phase 2/3 adaptive clinical trial in patients with AMKD in 2022. We completed t\nhe Phase 2B portion of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial and initiated the Phase 3 portion of the study in 2024. \nWe continue to enroll and dose people with AMKD in the Phase 3 portion of the global Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial (“AMPLITUDE”). We expect to complete enrollment in the interim analysis cohort in 2025 and apply for potential accelerated approval in the U.S., assuming a positive interim analysis.\nIn addition, we have initiated \na Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial (“AMPLIFIED”) evaluating inaxaplin as a treatment for people with AMKD and diabetes or other co-morbidities currently not eligible for the AMPLITUDE trial.\n8\nIgA Nephropathy and Other B Cell-Mediated Diseases\nIgAN is a serious, progressive, life-threatening chronic kidney disease that causes inflammation and damage to the kidneys. It is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, affecting approximately 300,000 people in the U.S. and Europe, and, in China, there are approximately 750,000 people diagnosed with IgAN. A high percentage of people with IgAN progress to end-stage kidney disease. While there are approved therapies for the treatment of IgAN, there are no approved therapies that specifically target the underlying cause of the disease. \nIgAN is thought to occur when the body produces an abnormal form of IgA, a type of antibody that normally helps the body fight infections. The body generates an abnormal immune response, including antibodies (autoantibodies), against this abnormal IgA, and these antibodies can combine to create larger molecules called immune complexes. These immune complexes can deposit in the kidneys, triggering damage and inflammation, especially within the glomeruli, impairing the kidneys’ ability to properly filter waste and fluid. \nIn 2024, we acquired Alpine and its lead asset, povetacicept, which has the potential of being a “pipeline-in-a-product.” Povetacicept is a dual antagonist of BAFF and APRIL, which play key roles in pathogenesis of IgAN and multiple other autoimmune diseases via their roles in the activation, differentiation and/or survival of B cells, T cells and innate immune cells. Povetacicept is a protein therapeutic based upon an engineered TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor) domain. It has demonstrated higher binding affinity and greater potency in preclinical studies versus other inhibitors of BAFF and/or APRIL and has demonstrated potential best-in-class efficacy in a clinical trial in people with IgAN. Povetacicept is being studied as a once every four weeks subcutaneous injection, with the aim of at home self-administration upon commercialization.\nIn 2024, we initiated RAINIER, our global Phase 3 pivotal trial of povetacicept versus placebo in approximately 480 people with IgAN, which is enrolling and dosing people in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The clinical trial design contemplates a pre-planned interim analysis evaluating the change from baseline in urine protein-to-creatine ratio (“UPCR”) after a certain number of patients reach 36 weeks of treatment. If positive, the interim analysis may serve as the basis to seek accelerated approval in the U.S. The final analysis will occur when patients reach two years of treatment and will evaluate total eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) slope. \nWe expect to complete enrollment in the interim analysis cohort in 2025 and apply for potential accelerated approval in the U.S., assuming a positive interim analysis.\nIn January 2025, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai Lab Limited (“Zai”) for the development and commercialization of povetacicept in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan region and Singapore. Under this collaboration, Zai will help advance the povetacicept clinical trials and make the regulatory submissions in the licensed territories. Zai will also be responsible for commercialization activities in the licensed territories, if povetacicept becomes an approved product. \nWe believe povetacicept holds the potential to transform multiple B-cell mediated diseases and deliver on its potential as a pipeline-in-a-product, with significant market opportunity across multiple therapeutic areas. In addition to IgAN, we are evaluating povetacicept as a treatment for other B cell-mediated autoimmune kidney diseases in the RUBY-3 basket trial and as a treatment for autoimmune cytopenias in the RUBY-4 basket trial. Both of these basket trials are ongoing, and we expect data in some of these conditions in 2025. \nType 1 Diabetes\nT1D is a chronic metabolic disorder caused by insufficient insulin secretion by the beta cells in the pancreas. In patients with T1D, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the person’s own immune system, resulting in a lack of insulin and impairment of blood glucose control. While insulin therapy allows patients to live for decades with the disease, challenges of insulin therapy include inadequate control of blood sugar (both hyper- and hypo-glycemia), a substantial burden of care on patients and families, and long-term vascular complications. Current standards of care do not address the underlying causes of the disease, and there are limited treatment options beyond insulin for the management of T1D.\nWe are developing non-autologous (allogeneic) fully differentiated, stem-cell derived islet cell therapies designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, with the goal of delivering a functional cure. We are pursuing multiple programs for the transplant of functional islets into patients, including: transplantation of islet cells alone followed by standard, chronic immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, implantation of the islet cells inside a \n9\nnovel immunoprotective device, alternative approaches to immunosuppression that could be used with the implanted islet cells, and development of hypoimmune islet cells to optimize protection of the implanted islet cells from the immune system.\nZimislecel, our first program, is a stem cell-derived, allogeneic, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, using standard immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells. The Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial is designed as a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zimislecel, and has been expanded to include a total of 50 people. We expect to complete enrollment and dosing in the Phase 3 portion of this clinical trial in 2025 and, assuming positive data, we expect to file for approval after patients have completed one year of insulin-free follow-up. Data presented demonstrate unprecedented efficacy and curative potential. Safety data are consistent with the immunosuppressives, the perioperative period, and past medical history. In addition, we have initiated a clinical trial evaluating zimislecel in people with T1D who have had a kidney transplant. \nIn our second program, we are evaluating VX-264, in which zimislecel is encapsulated in an immunoprotective device that is implanted in patients, which we believe can obviate the need for immunosuppressive therapy. We are enrolling and dosing patients with VX-264 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VX-264. Part A of the study dosed patients with a partial dose of cells/devices and a stagger between patients, Part B dosed patients with a full target dose and a stagger between patients, and Part C will dose at full target dose without a stagger between patients. We expect to share Part B full-dose data from this clinical trial in 2025.\nIn our third program, research is directed toward developing hypoimmune cells by gene-editing zimislecel prior to differentiation into fully differentiated islets in order to cloak them from the immune system. This program continues to advance in pre-clinical development. We are also pursuing alternative approaches to immunosuppression that could be used with zimislecel.\nMyotonic Dystrophy Type 1 \nDM1 is an inherited disease that results in the weakening and destruction of skeletal muscles over time. Muscle weakness, muscle wasting and myotonia (sustained muscle contraction and difficulty relaxing muscles) are the hallmark features of DM1. It is a serious life-shortening disease with no approved treatments. \nVX-670, our lead approach for DM1, holds the potential to address the underlying cause of DM1. VX-670 is an oligonucleotide connected to a cyclic peptide to promote effective delivery into cells. We completed the single ascending dose portion of the global Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the first candidate, VX-670, in patients with DM1. We are enrolling and dosing the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-670. We also have a small molecule program for DM1 in preclinical development. \nAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\nADPKD is a life-shortening genetic kidney disease characterized by the growth of numerous kidney-enlarging cysts that impair kidney function and can ultimately lead to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation, and premature death. Kidney cysts can also lead to severe abdominal pain, cyst infection, blood in the urine and kidney stones, all of which significantly impair quality of life. Around half of patients with ADPKD experience kidney failure by the age of 60.\nVX-407 is a first-in-class small molecule corrector that is designed to target the underlying cause of ADPKD in people with a subset of PKD1 variants. We are nearing completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating VX-407 and expect to advance VX-407 into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in people with ADPKD in 2025.\nCOMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR MEDICINES\nOur commercialization efforts focus on supporting the appropriate use of ALYFTREK, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, ORKAMBI, KALYDECO, CASGEVY and JOURNAVX in the markets where these products have been approved. Our teams are responsible for promoting products to health care providers, ensuring our products are distributed effectively, ensuring the safe use of our products, and obtaining reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets. In parallel, our government affairs and public \n10\npolicy group advocates for policies that promote life sciences innovation and increase awareness of the diseases on which we are focusing with state and federal legislatures, government agencies, public health officials and other policymakers. \nCommercialization of CF Medicines \nIn the U.S., we primarily sell our CF products to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors. In international markets, we sell our CF products primarily through distributor arrangements and to retail pharmacies, as well as to hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported. We also have established programs in the U.S. that provide our CF products to qualified uninsured or underinsured patients at no charge or at a reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria. \nOur U.S. field-based CF commercial team is comprised of a small number of individuals to support commercialization of our medicines for CF. We focus our CF marketing efforts in the U.S. on a relatively small number of physicians and health care professionals who write most of the prescriptions for CF medicines. Many of these physicians and health care professionals are located at a limited number of accredited centers in the U.S. focused on the treatment of CF. In international markets, we or our distributors have small sales forces that support TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO in jurisdictions where these products are approved. \nIn December 2024, the FDA approved ALYFTREK in the U.S. as a treatment for people with CF 6 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation or another mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ALYFTREK. This includes people with CF with one of 31 mutations who are now eligible for a CFTR modulator for the first time. ALYFTREK demonstrated non-inferiority to TRIKAFTA in ppFEV\n1\n, a measure of lung function, and an improvement in sweat chloride levels as compared to TRIKAFTA, and we believe that this medicine has the potential to improve the care of patients with CF. ALYFTREK has the additional benefit of a once-daily dosing regimen and may lead to a new standard in CF care, reinforcing our established position as the leading company in CF. In addition, this new triple combination regimen has a lower royalty burden than our other CF medicines. We believe ALYFTREK presents an opportunity for three types of patients: (i) those who are currently on a CFTR modulator who may want to switch to ALYFTREK, (ii) those patients who have not yet been initiated on a CFTR modulator or been eligible for a CFTR modulator, and (iii) those who have discontinued from another CFTR modulator. We are supporting the launch of ALYFTREK through our existing commercial infrastructure.\nALYFTREK is under regulatory review in the U.K., the E.U., Canada, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. \nAdditionally, in December 2024, the FDA approved the expanded use of TRIKAFTA for the treatment of people with CF 2 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or a mutation that is responsive to TRIKAFTA based on clinical and/or in vitro data. With this approval, 94 additional non-F508del CFTR mutations have been added to the TRIKAFTA label, and approximately 300 additional people with CF in the U.S. are now eligible to receive TRIKAFTA as a treatment.\nCommercialization of CASGEVY\nWe are continuing the commercial launch of CASGEVY, following approvals in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Canada and Switzerland. We expect to obtain additional regulatory approvals for CASGEVY in 2025. We estimate approximately 60,000 people with severe SCD and TDT are or could become eligible for CASGEVY in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.\nAs CASGEVY is the first CRISPR-based therapy to be approved, our global launch strategy is focused on educating physicians, patients and caregivers, payors, and policymakers about the significant disease burden of SCD and TDT and the availability of CASGEVY as a treatment option. We have also established a global manufacturing network to ensure adequate production and supply of CASGEVY at commercial scale. Given the geographic concentration of patients, we expect to reach the majority of patients through our specialty commercial model, which is comprised of a small number of field-based individuals. Because the administration of CASGEVY requires specialized experience in stem cell transplantation, we are engaging with experienced hospitals to establish a network of authorized treatment centers across the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. We have activated more than 50 authorized treatment centers across the U.S., Europe, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE, and we are working to activate additional centers.\n Our teams are actively engaged with key treatment centers, policymakers and third-party payors to ensure that patients who may be eligible for CASGEVY have access to this potentially curative therapy. We are seeking broad access with \n11\ngovernment and commercial payors for CASGEVY. In the U.S., there is broad coverage of CASGEVY in the private and public payer space, initially through single case agreements as medical policies are finalized. In addition, we have recently reached an agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to participate in its cell and gene therapy access model, which may enable additional access mechanisms for states and authorized treatment centers. In England, we have secured access for eligible people with TDT and SCD. In the E.U., we are working with national health authorities to achieve access and reimbursement and have secured reimbursed access for people with SCD or TDT in Luxembourg, we have established a hospital-based reimbursement for CASGEVY in Austria, and the Italian Medicines Agency has approved early access for CASGEVY, on a case-by-case basis, to treat people with TDT or SCD. In the Middle East, we have reached a hospital-based reimbursement for people with SCD or TDT in Saudi Arabia, and for national reimbursement for eligible people in Bahrain. We are actively working to expand access to CASGEVY across Europe and the Middle East. \nWe are currently treating patients across multiple geographies and more than 50 patients have initiated cell collection. The first commercial patient was infused with CASGEVY in the third quarter of 2024. \nCommercialization of JOURNAVX\n \nIn January 2025, JOURNAVX was approved by the FDA as a treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe acute pain. We believe JOURNAVX has the potential to establish a new standard of care for the estimated 80 million patients in the U.S. who are prescribed a medicine for their acute pain each year. Approximately half of these patients are prescribed opioids, which, while effective, have significant safety and tolerability concerns, and addictive potential. JOURNAVX provides effective relief of moderate-to-severe acute pain, has a favorable safety and tolerability profile, and based on its mechanism of action, does not have addictive potential.\nOur commercial focus at launch for JOURNAVX is securing broad access and investing to ensure a seamless experience for patients and physicians. We are engaging with key health care professionals, formulary decision makers and payers to establish the conditions for rapid patient access and uptake. Our commercial field team is engaging stakeholders to support the launch of JOURNAVX in hospitals and other healthcare settings in the U.S. In addition, we are working to secure broad stocking agreements with national retail pharmacies and regional chains, to ensure access to JOURNAVX for patients across the U.S.\nWe are also focused on ensuring there is equal access to non-opioid options for pain relief. We continue to see momentum from federal and state policymakers to support the appropriate use of non-opioid pain medications, including addressing financial and other administrative barriers, such as utilization management, to accessing non-opioid options. In addition, as a part of our commitment to patients, we are offering financial and copay support programs for eligible patients who are prescribed JOURNAVX. \nReimbursement of Approved Therapies\nOur CF medicines are used by patients in more than 60 countries, and TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO is reimbursed or accessible in more than 50 of these countries outside the U.S. We expect to continue to focus significant resources to maintain reimbursement and obtain expanded reimbursement for our CF medicines and pipeline therapies in ex-U.S. markets. \nIn SCD and TDT, CASGEVY is approved in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Canada and Switzerland, and we are actively engaged with relevant stakeholders to obtain broad access and reimbursement with government and commercial payors for CASGEVY. CASGEVY is broadly reimbursed by third-party payors in the U.S., including the federal government. Currently in the U.S., across commercial and government payors, all eligible CASGEVY patients have case-by-case coverage through single case agreements, and we have signed agreements with national and regional payors, which cover over 250 million lives, to provide access to CASGEVY. Within Medicare, to help address this issue, we applied for and CMS has granted a new technology add-on payment for CASGEVY when used for the treatment of SCD for Medicare patients. Within Medicaid, we have engaged all of the Medicaid administrators in all 50 U.S. states, focused on the 25 states with the highest prevalence of SCD patients, and have confirmed pathways to reimbursement in all 25 of those priority states. In addition, in February 2023, the U.S. Administration established a new demonstration program to help pay for cell and gene therapies in diseases such as SCD through the CMS program known as The Cell and Gene Therapy Access Model (“CGT Access Model”). The CGT Access Model was designed to provide an opportunity to accelerate and enhance broad Medicaid access for eligible patients across all 50 U.S. states by allowing state Medicaid agencies to delegate authority to CMS to coordinate and facilitate outcomes-based payment arrangements (“OBAs”) with cell and gene therapy \n12\nmanufacturers, such as ours. In December 2024, we reached an agreement with CMS to expand access by participating in the CGT Access Model for SCD to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries. \nFor CASGEVY in ex-U.S. markets, we anticipate some early access programs initially and in parallel we are pursuing long-term reimbursement arrangements. We have successfully achieved national reimbursement in England, Luxembourg, and Bahrain for people with TDT or SCD, and secured hospital-based reimbursement for patients in Saudi Arabia and Austria. We continue to engage with payors in the U.K., the E.U., and the Middle East. \nFor JOURNAVX in the U.S., we have been working with government and commercial payors pre- and post-approval to support rapid and broad access, including to accelerate targeted contracting and formulary additions at both select payors and targeted hospital systems. In addition, we are finalizing contracts with private and government payors, as well as hospital group purchasing organizations.\nSTRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS AND COLLABORATIONS\nAs part of our business strategy, we seek to license or acquire technologies, products, product candidates, and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. In addition, we establish business relationships with collaborators to support our research activities and to lead or support development and/or commercialization of certain product candidates. We expect to continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions, licenses and collaborations that may be similar or different from the transactions that we have engaged in previously.\nStrategic Transactions\nIn May 2024, we acquired Alpine for approximately $5.0 billion. Alpine’s lead molecule, povetacicept, is \na highly potent and effective dual antagonist of BAFF and APRIL. We are evaluating povetacicept for the potential treatment of IgAN in a Phase 3 clinical trial and for the treatment of other serious autoimmune diseases in Phase 2 clinical trials. \nWe believe povetacicept has the potential to treat multiple diseases or conditions and become a pipeline-in-a-product, with significant market opportunity across multiple therapeutic areas. \nIn addition to Alpine, we have made additional acquisitions which have expanded and advanced our pipeline, including: \n•\nIn 2017, we enhanced our CF portfolio through our acquisition of certain CF assets, including deutivacaftor, from Concert Pharmaceuticals Inc. In December 2024, the FDA approved ALYFTREK (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor) \nfor people with CF 6 years of age and older. \n•\nIn 2019, we established our T1D program through our acquisition of Semma, a privately held company focused on the use of stem cell-derived human islets as a potentially curative treatment for T1D. We are evaluating zimislecel for the potential treatment of T1D in a Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial. We expect to complete enrollment and dosing in the Phase 3 portion of this clinical trial in 2025. In addition, our second clinical program in T1D, VX-264, in which zimislecel is encapsulated in an immunoprotective device, is ongoing.\nWe expect to continue to identify and make acquisitions to expand and advance our pipeline and business. \nCollaboration and Licensing Arrangements\nJoint Development and Commercialization Agreement with CRISPR\nIn December 2017, we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement (“Original JDCA”) with CRISPR, pursuant to which we are co-developing and co-commercializing CASGEVY for SCD and TDT. We entered into the Original JDCA following our exercise of an option \nto co-develop and co-commercialize the hemoglobinopathies program that was contained in the collaboration agreement that we entered into with CRISPR in 2015. \nIn April 2021, we and CRISPR amended and restated the Original JDCA (the “A&R JDCA”). Pursuant to the A&R JDCA, the parties agreed to, among other things, (a) adjust the governance structure for the collaboration and adjust the responsibilities of each party thereunder; (b) adjust the allocation of net profits and net losses between the parties; and (c) \n13\nexclusively license (subject to CRISPR’s reserved rights to conduct certain activities) certain intellectual property rights to us relating to the products that may be \nresearched\n, developed, manufactured and commercialized under such agreement. \nPursuant to the A&R JDCA, we lead global development, manufacturing and commercialization of CASGEVY, with support from CRISPR. Subject to the terms and conditions of the A&R JDCA, we have the right to conduct all research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities relating to the product candidates and products under the A&R JDCA (including CASGEVY) throughout the world, subject to CRISPR’s reserved right to conduct certain activities.\nIn connection with the A&R JDCA, we made a $\n900.0\n million upfront payment to CRISPR in the second quarter of 2021. CRISPR earned an additional one-time $\n200.0\n million milestone payment upon receipt of marketing approval of CASGEVY from the FDA.\nWe and CRISPR shared equally all expenses incurred under the Original JDCA. On July 1, 2021, with respect to CASGEVY, the net profits and net losses incurred pursuant to the A&R JDCA began to be allocated 60% to us and 40% to CRISPR, subject to certain adjustments, while all other product candidates and products continue to have net profits and net losses shared equally between the parties. \nEither party may terminate the A&R JDCA upon the other party’s material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or, in our case, in the event that CRISPR becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, winding up, or similar circumstances. Either party may terminate the A&R JDCA in the event the other party commences or participates in any action or proceeding challenging the validity or enforceability of any patent that is licensed to such challenging party pursuant to the A&R JDCA. We also have the right to terminate the A&R JDCA for convenience at any time after giving prior written notice.\n \nIf circumstances arise pursuant to which a party would have the right to terminate the A&R JDCA on account of an uncured material breach, such party may elect to keep the A&R JDCA in effect and cause such breaching party to be treated as if it had exercised its opt-out rights with respect to the products associated with such uncured material breach and the royalties payable to the breaching party would be reduced by a specified percentage.\nEither party may opt out of the development of a product candidate under the A&R JDCA after predetermined points in the development of the product candidate, on a candidate-by-candidate basis. In the event of such opt-out, the party opting-out will no longer share in the net profits and net losses associated with such product candidate and, instead, the opting out party will be entitled to high single to mid-teen percentage royalties on the net sales of such product, if commercialized.\nIn-License Agreements\nWe have entered into various agreements pursuant to which we have obtained access to technologies from third parties and are conducting research and development activities with collaborators. Pursuant to these arrangements, we have obtained development and commercialization rights to resulting product candidates. Depending on the terms of the arrangements, we may be responsible for the costs of research activities, required to make upfront payments and/or milestone payments upon the achievement of certain research, development, and commercial objectives, and/or pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. Our current in-license agreements include:\n•\nCRISPR Therapeutics AG.\n In addition to our arrangement with CRISPR described above, we have exercised options to exclusively license treatments for specific targets, including CF, that were subject to the research program under the collaboration agreement we entered into with CRISPR in 2015. In 2019, we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to CRISPR’s intellectual property for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) and DM1 gene-editing products through a new agreement with CRISPR. In 2023, we obtained non-exclusive rights to CRISPR’s intellectual property for the development of hypoimmune gene-edited cell therapies for T1D through a new agreement with CRISPR.\n•\nModerna, Inc.\n \nIn 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Moderna for the identification and development of mRNA therapeutics encoding CFTR for the treatment of CF. \nIn December 2022, the FDA cleared our\n Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”)\n for VX-522, an mRNA therapeutic we are developing with Moderna pursuant to this collaboration. The multiple ascending dose portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VX-522 in people with CF is ongoing. We expect to share data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2025.\n•\nEntrada Therapeutics, Inc.\n In 2022, we established a collaboration with Entrada focused on enabling efficient intracellular delivery of an oligonucleotide for DM1. This collaboration includes VX-670, an investigational candidate for the treatment of DM1 that is in clinical development. \nWe completed the single ascending dose portion \n14\nof the global Phase 1/2 clinical trial for VX-670 in people with DM1. We are enrolling and dosing the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-670.\nOut-license Agreements\nWe have entered into various agreements pursuant to which we have out-licensed rights to certain product candidates to third-party collaborators. Pursuant to these out-license arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for all costs related to the continued development of such product candidates and obtain development and commercialization rights to these product candidates. Depending on the terms of the arrangements, our collaborators may be required to make upfront payments, milestone payments upon the achievement of certain research and development objectives and/or pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products licensed under the agreement. \nIn January 2025, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai for the development and commercialization of povetacicept in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan region and Singapore. Under this collaboration, Zai will help advance the povetacicept clinical trials and make the regulatory submissions in the licensed territories. Zai will also be responsible for commercialization activities in the licensed territories, if povetacicept becomes an approved product. \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation\nIn 2004, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, as successor in interest to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., to support research and development activities. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, as amended, we have agreed to pay tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens on covered compounds first synthesized and/or tested during a research term on or before February 28, 2014, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor and tezacaftor and royalties ranging from low-single digits to mid-single digits on net sales of certain compounds first synthesized and/or tested between March 1, 2014 and August 31, 2016, including elexacaftor. We do not have any royalty obligations on compounds first synthesized and tested on or after September 1, 2016. For combination products, such as ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, and ALYFTREK sales are allocated equally to each of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the combination product, and royalties are then paid for any royalty-bearing components included in the combination.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nPatents and other intellectual property rights such as trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights are critical to our business. We actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as appropriate. In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information.\nPatents provide a period of exclusivity that can make it more difficult for competitors to market and use our technology. We own and control patents and pending patent applications that relate to compounds, formulations, synthetic routes, intermediates, devices, treatment of diseases, and other inventions.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we typically apply for patents several years before a product receives marketing approval. Under current law, a patent expires 20 years from its first effective filing date. Since the drug development process may last for many years, there may be a period of time in which we have an issued patent but not marketing approval to sell the drug. To compensate for patent term lost while a product is in clinical trials and undergoing review for marketing approval, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates (“SPCs”) in some countries. In addition to patent protection, we receive regulatory exclusivity from U.S. and European regulatory agencies for the active pharmaceutical and biological agents and, where applicable, their approved orphan indications for a certain time period. Regulatory exclusivity runs concurrently with patent exclusivity and provides complementary protection for our products.\nFor our approved commercial products, and those in development, we own or hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to several hundred patents around the world. In the U.S., once an NDA, or a supplement thereto, is approved we are required to list with the FDA each U.S. patent with claims that cover our product or a method of using the product. The FDA publishes the patents we list in a book referred to as the Orange Book. We have thirteen issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in KALYDECO, its marketed formulations, and/or its approved indication. \n15\nWe have 22 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in ORKAMBI, its marketed formulations, and/or its approved indication. We have 25 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in SYMDEKO, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication. We have 28 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in TRIKAFTA, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication. We have 35 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in ALYFTREK, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication. We expect to have an issued patent listed in the Orange Book that covers the active pharmaceutical ingredient in JOURNAVX, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication.\nProducts approved by the FDA under a Biologics Licensing Application (“BLA”), including CASGEVY, receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. from a product’s approval date. Additionally, we have licenses to dozens of issued U.S. patents that cover CASGEVY, its approved indication, and/or its manufacture. Products approved by the FDA under a BLA are not subject to the Orange Book patent listing requirement.\nThe table below sets forth the year of projected expiration for the basic product patent covering each of our approved products. For products that are combinations of two or more active ingredients, the table lists the projected expiration of the latest expiring patent covering any of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (lumacaftor for ORKAMBI, tezacaftor for SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, elexacaftor for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO and vanzacaftor for ALYFTREK). Unless otherwise noted, patent term extensions, and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below and may extend protection. In some instances, we also own later-expiring patents and applications relating to solid forms, formulations, methods of manufacture, or the use of these drugs in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. In some cases, however, such patents may not protect our drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent.\nProduct\nExpiration Year\nof U.S. Basic Product Patent\nExpiration Year\nof European Basic Product Patent\nKALYDECO\n2027\n  2027 \n1\nORKAMBI\n2031\n  2030\n 1\nSYMDEKO/SYMKEVI\n2027\n  2033\n 1\nTRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO\n2037\n2037\nCASGEVY\n  2035 \n2\n    2034\n 3, 4\nALYFTREK\n2039\n2039\nJOURNAVX\n2040\n2040\n1 \nExpiration date reflects SPCs granted in the five major European markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.).\n2 \nExpiration year reflects the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, which expires later than the basic product patent for this product in this market.\n3 \nExpiration year reflects the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in the E.U., which expires later than the basic product patent for this product in this market. \n4\n Product is approved in Great Britain with regulatory exclusivity until November 2033, which is later than the expiration of the basic product patent.\nIn addition to protecting our marketed products, we actively file patent applications in the U.S. and in foreign countries on inventions relating to our pipeline. For example, we also own and/or control U.S. and foreign patents and/or patent applications relating to the following:\n•\nOther CF potentiators and correctors and many other related compounds, and the use of those compounds for the treatment CF.\n•\nVX-522 and other mRNA-based approaches for treating CF.\n•\nVX-993, VX-973, and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of pain. \n•\nInaxaplin and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of AMKD.\n•\nPovetacicept for the treatment of IgAN.\n•\nZimislecel, VX-264, and other cell-based approaches for treating T1D.\n16\n•\nVX-670 for the treatment of DM1.\n•\nVX-407 and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of ADPKD.\n•\nOther pre-clinical and clinical candidates and the use of such candidates to treat specified diseases.\n•\nThe manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions, related solid forms, formulations, dosing regimens, and methods of use of many of the above compounds.\nWe and CRISPR intend to rely upon a combination of rights, including patent rights, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivities to protect CASGEVY. CRISPR has licensed certain rights to a worldwide patent portfolio that covers various aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 editing platform technology including, for example, compositions of matter and methods of use, including their use in targeting or cutting DNA, from Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier. In addition to Dr. Charpentier, this patent portfolio has named inventors who assigned their rights to the Regents of the University of California or the University of Vienna, to whom we refer, together with Dr. Charpentier, as the CVC Group. CRISPR has non-exclusive or co-exclusive rights to the patent rights that protect the core CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. For example, certain third parties, including competitors, have reported obtaining a license to rights in this patent portfolio in certain fields. In addition, patents and patent applications in this patent portfolio are the subject of adversarial proceedings in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions, including proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), between the CVC Group and, separately, Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC (“Sigma-Aldrich”), ToolGen, Inc. (“ToolGen”), and the Broad Institute, Harvard University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (collectively, “Broad”). To date, both the CVC Group and Broad have obtained granted patents that purport to cover aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 editing platform technology. The patents and patent applications within the patent portfolios of the CVC Group, Broad, Sigma-Aldrich and/or ToolGen are, or may in the future be, involved in proceedings similar to interferences or priority disputes in Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. In December 2023, we entered into an agreement with Editas Medicine, Inc. (“Editas”), providing us a non-exclusive sublicense to certain patents relating to CRISPR/Cas9 technology, owned by Broad and Harvard, which are licensed to Editas. In addition to the patent portfolios licensed from Dr. Charpentier, Broad, and Harvard, we own patents and/or patent applications relating to the composition, manufacture, and use of CASGEVY.\nFrom time to time, we enter into exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements for proprietary third-party technology used in connection with our research activities. These license agreements typically provide for the payment by us of a license fee but may also include terms providing for milestone payments or royalties for the development and/or commercialization of our drug products arising from the related research.\nWe cannot be certain that issued patents we own or license will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. \nThe existence of patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, \ninter partes\n reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of intellectual property rights that may be claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. \nMANUFACTURING \nAs we market and sell our approved products and advance our product candidates through clinical development toward commercialization, we continue to build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. We rely on internal capabilities and a global network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials, as well as our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials. In addition to establishing supply chains for each new approved product, we must adapt our supply chain for existing products to include additional formulations that are often required to treat younger patients or to increase scale of production for existing products. We are focused on ensuring the stability of the supply chains for our current products, including KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, ALYFTREK, CASGEVY, JOURNAVX, and for our pipeline programs. In addition, we are focused on identifying and ensuring efficient manufacturing and delivery processes for the biological and cell and genetic therapies we are developing, including our stem cell therapy program for T1D and biologics manufacturing for povetacicept and other product candidates.\n17\nWe have established our own small molecule manufacturing capabilities in Boston, which we use for clinical trial and commercial supplies, including certain manufacturing steps related to our commercial supply of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO. We expect to continue to rely on third parties to meet our commercial supply needs, including for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, CASGEVY, ALYFTREK, JOURNAVX, and pipeline programs, and a significant portion of our clinical supply needs for the foreseeable future. We have established and continue to evaluate additional manufacturing capacity for our current and future products, including recently approved ALYFTREK for CF, and JOURNAVX for pain.\nOur supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing our product and product candidates, including obtaining all necessary supplies, is a multi-step global endeavor. In general, these raw materials and other necessary supplies are available from multiple sources. Third-party contract manufacturers, including some in China, perform different parts of our manufacturing process. Contract manufacturers supply us with raw materials, convert these raw materials into drug substance and/or convert the drug substance or product into final dosage form. In addition, third parties assist us with packaging, warehousing, and global distribution of our products. Establishing and managing this global supply chain for each of our products and product candidates require a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. \nThe manufacturing processes for biological and cell and genetic therapies are more complex than those required for small molecule drugs and require different systems, equipment, facilities, and expertise. Additionally, we are unable to utilize a single process for all of our biological and cell and genetic therapies; they must be customized for each program and therapy. We are investing and plan to continue to invest significant resources in expanding and strengthening our manufacturing, infrastructure and capabilities, such as cGMP clinical manufacturing, both independently and through third-party networks, in an effort to develop and commercialize our biological and cell and genetic therapies. We have secured agreements for povetacicept and our T1D cell therapy program to meet our anticipated demands. We continue to evaluate additional suppliers for all of our late-stage clinical programs for additional capacity and redundancy to support commercial supply. \nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce or process cell culture reagents and gene-editing components, such as Cas9 protein and guide RNA molecules for clinical trials and commercial supply of CASGEVY, and to generate gene-edited cells to supply CASGEVY. We continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supply of CASGEVY. The manufacturing process for CASGEVY involves a number of steps prior to the final infusion of drug product into patients. Following mobilization and collection of blood cells from the patient, cells are transferred to a manufacturing site where HSPCs are purified and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing is performed. The edited cellular product, called CASGEVY, is frozen and transported back to the authorized treatment center where it is stored prior to infusion into the patient. Each step must be completed successfully, and in a timely manner, requiring coordination between us, authorized treatment centers, third-party manufacturers and shipping vendors. We are making significant investments to secure additional capacity and to coordinate manufacturing, testing, and logistics activities at a larger scale across multiple facilities to serve the geographies in which we are treating and expect to treat additional patients with CASGEVY.\nWe have established manufacturing capabilities in the Boston area to support our T1D program. In addition, to further expand our capabilities in cell therapy manufacturing, we have a strategic agreement with Lonza to support the manufacture of our portfolio of investigational allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell therapies. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to produce drug substance and finished drug product for clinical trials for povetacicept. \nWe have developed systems and processes to track, monitor, and oversee our and our third-party manufacturers’ activities, including a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers comply with cGMP and the foreign jurisdictional equivalents when applicable. We devote substantial time, resources and effort in the areas of production, quality control, and quality assurance to maintain cGMP compliance. We regularly evaluate the performance of our third-party manufacturers with the objective of confirming their continuing capabilities to meet our needs efficiently and economically. Manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic, are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and other U.S. and foreign government authorities. Although we actively engage with regulatory authorities, the timing of inspections and regulatory approvals for each of these facilities is the remit of the manufacturer and not within our control and may be delayed for a number of reasons.\n18\nCOMPETITION\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive research efforts, rapid technological progress, and intense competition. There are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our drugs are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in a larger concentration of resources among a smaller number of our competitors. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and human resources than we do. \nWe believe that competition in our industry is based on, among other factors, innovative research, the effective and rapid development of product candidates, the ability to market and obtain reimbursement for products and the ability to establish effective patent protection. We face competition based on the safety and efficacy of our product and product candidates, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent protection and other factors. Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer, or more affordable products than we are able to develop or commercialize or obtain more effective patent protection. As a result, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would adversely affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our product candidates, if approved, would achieve and maintain market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products. Future competitive products may render our products, or future products, obsolete or noncompetitive. Another key element of remaining competitive in our industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientific, technical and management personnel to conduct our research activities and advance our development programs, including with the commercial expertise to effectively market our products. \nOur success in rapidly developing and commercializing our products may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of potential treatments. In addition, clinical trials conducted by our competitors could take place simultaneously with our own trials and may slow down our pace of development if we are unable to recruit sufficient clinical trial subjects. If one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a marketable treatment, our revenues from our current products and/or additional products, if then approved, could face significant competitive pressure.\nMany other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investing resources for the discovery and development of small molecules and biologic and cell and gene therapies to treat the same disease areas for which we are developing therapies in our pipeline. If any of these competitors develop or successfully commercialize products involving therapies competitive with our pipeline therapies, the potential return on our investment in those pipeline therapies could be impacted.\nCystic Fibrosis\nA number of companies are seeking to identify and develop product candidates for the treatment of CF, including CFTR modulators and other therapies intended to address the underlying causes of CF.\nSionna Therapeutics, Inc. has multiple CFTR modulators in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development, including assets in-licensed from AbbVie Inc. in July 2024, and additional CFTR modulators in preclinical development. Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. was developing potential CFTR modulator therapies prior to its acquisition by Yumanity Therapeutics, Inc. (“Yumanity”). Following the merger, Yumanity out-licensed the CF program to Fair Therapeutics. In February 2024, HIT-CF Europe, a research project from CF-Europe, a federation of European patient advocacy groups, initiated a Phase 2b trial of a combination of Fair Therapeutics’ CFTR modulators in European CF patients with rare mutations of the CFTR gene. \nOther therapeutic approaches include addressing CF utilizing nucleic acid therapies, which are compounds that allow expression of a functional CFTR protein and are relevant for the more than 5,000 people with CF who cannot make full-length CFTR protein and cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Nucleic acid therapies are under development by companies such as Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., ReCode Therapeutics, Inc., Krystal Biotech, Inc., Spirovant Sciences, Inc. Boehringer Ingelheim International, GmbH, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Inc and SpliSense, Ltd. \nSickle Cell and Beta Thalassemia\nThere are multiple approved small molecule and biologic treatments for SCD and beta thalassemia, including products from Novartis International AG (“Novartis”), and Bristol Myers Squibb together with Merck & Co. In addition, bluebird bio, \n19\nInc. (“bluebird”) obtained FDA approval of its gene therapy, ZYNTEGLO\n™\n (betibeglogene autotemcel) in August 2022 for the treatment of patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions. bluebird withdrew its marketing authorizations for Zynteglo from both the E.U. and U.K. in early 2022. In late 2023, bluebird also obtained FDA approval for its gene therapy for SCD, LYFGENIA\n™\n (lovotibeglogene autotemcel). In September 2024, Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) voluntarily withdrew OXBRYTA\n®\n (voxelotor) from all markets. Authorization for Novartis’ ADAKVEO\n®\n (crizanlizumab) has been revoked in the U.K. and in Europe, however, this drug remains approved for use in the U.S. by the FDA.\nVarious companies and private academic/medical institutes are developing therapies for the treatment of SCD or beta thalassemia utilizing CRISPR technology, lentiviral vectors, or transcription activator-like effector nuclease, gene correction, base, or prime editing. For example, Beam Therapeutics has a base-editing asset in clinical development for SCD. In addition, Agios Pharmaceuticals’ Supplemental New Drug Application for PYRUKYND\n® \n(mitapivat) is under review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with non-transfusion dependent and transfusion dependent alpha- or beta thalassemia. Mitapivat is also in Phase 3 for SCD.\nPain\nThe acute pain market largely consists of conventional analgesics, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and local anesthetics, low-cost generics, and reformulations aiming to provide safer, more tolerable, or more convenient therapies. Peripheral neuropathic pain is a type of chronic pain caused by injury or dysfunction of peripheral nerves. The peripheral neuropathic pain market largely consists of generic anticonvulsants and anti-depressant drugs.\nSeveral companies are pursuing clinical development of novel mechanisms of action for acute and chronic pain indications, including NaV1.8 inhibitors in Phase 1 clinical trials by Latigo Bio, Merck, and SiteOne Therapeutics. Several additional NaV1.8/1.7 inhibitors are in preclinical development for pain, and there are several other compounds with other mechanisms of action in development, including programs by Eli Lilly and Company (“Eli Lilly”) and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nT1D\nThe T1D standard of care of exogenous insulin injections continues to progress as multiple companies are developing novel insulin formulations, advanced pumps and glucose sensors, and fully closed loop systems. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are actively engaged in the research and development of products for T1D, including strategies to prevent the destruction of beta cells, to protect beta cell function, or to replace missing beta cells, as well as other cell therapy approaches such as immune evasive technologies to hide the cell from the immune system, micro- and macro-encapsulation technologies that potentially require no immunosuppression, and islets cell in combination with immunosuppression. In addition to CellTrans, Inc.’s LANTIDRA™ (donislecel), the first FDA-approved cadaveric islet therapy for the treatment of T1D, other companies developing cell therapies for T1D, either directly or through partnerships, include Novo Nordisk A/S, Eli Lilly, Sernova Corp, Sana Biotechnology, Inc., Seraxis, Inc., and Evotec A.G.\nAMKD\nThere are no approved therapies for AMKD. People with chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) take angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to treat hypertension; steroids and immunosuppressants to reduce proteinuria; and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of CKD progression. These CKD treatments may reduce proteinuria, but do not stop the rapid disease progression seen in AMKD patients. Several companies have early programs developing APOL1-targeted assets, including AstraZeneca, Maze Therapeutics, and OmniAb. Eli Lilly’s Janus kinase inhibitor (baricitinib) is being investigated in AMKD patients in a Phase 2 study by Duke University.\nIgAN\nIgAN is a rapidly evolving landscape with multiple potentially disease-modifying therapies in late-stage clinical development. There are three novel therapies for IgAN approved in major markets: Calliditas’ TARPEYO\n®\n/KINPEYGO\n® \n(delayed release budesonide), Travere Therapeutics’ FILSPARI\n® \n(sparsentan), a dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist, and Novartis’ FABHALTA\n®\n (iptacopan), a complement factor B inhibitor. Programs in late-stage clinical development include Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd’s sibeprenlimab (anti-APRIL mAb), Vera Therapeutics’ atacicept (dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor), RemeGen’s telitacicept (dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor), Novartis’ zigakibart (anti-APRIL mAb), and other programs from Novartis, Roche (and partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals), and AstraZeneca. Other mid-stage clinical \n20\nprograms include anti-CD38 mAbs from Biogen and Takeda. In addition, there is significant global preclinical and earlier stage clinical development activity for IgAN.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nOur operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the U.S., Europe and other countries. In the U.S., Europe and other countries, our products are subject to rigorous regulations governing their testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, and advertising and promotion. As a result of these regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming. The regulatory requirements applicable to drug and biologic development, approval, and marketing are subject to change. In addition, regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulations, guidance or interpretations will change.\nUnited States Government Regulation\nNew Drug Application and Biologics License Application Approval Processes\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:\n•\ncompletion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), and other applicable regulations;\n•\nsubmission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials in the U.S. may begin;\n•\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;\n•\nsubmission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or a BLA;\n•\nsatisfactory completion of a pre-approval FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and\n•\nFDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.\nOnce a drug or biologic is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal pharmacology and toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND, which seeks FDA approval to test the drug or biologic in humans. Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is submitted. \nIf the FDA accepts the IND, the drug or biologic can then be studied in human clinical trials to determine if the product candidate is safe and effective. Clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years and are expensive. These three phases, which are subject to considerable regulation, are as follows:\n•\nPhase 1. \nThe drug or biologic initially is introduced into a limited number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some drugs or biologics for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the drug or biologic may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.\n•\nPhase 2. \nClinical trials are next initiated in a limited patient population with the specified disease or condition the drug or biologic is intended to treat to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug or biologic candidate for the disease or condition it is intended to treat and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.\n21\n•\nPhase 3. \nClinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug or biologic and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.\nIt is possible that Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold or suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, and the occurrence of serious adverse events must also be reported. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the \nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\n website.\nPost-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.\nThe results of drug or biologic development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug or biologic, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the drug or biologic. The FDA reviews each NDA or BLA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts it for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. \nOnce the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a drug or biologic is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA or BLA should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is manufactured and tested. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.\nThe FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, submission of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form. \nExpedited Review and Approval\nThe FDA has developed a number of distinct approaches to make new drugs or biologics available as rapidly as possible in cases where there is no available treatment or there are advantages over existing treatments.\nThe FDA may grant “accelerated approval” to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For accelerated approval, the product must have an effect on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit. These studies are known as “confirmatory trials.” Approval of a drug may be withdrawn, or the labeled indication of the drug changed if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug or biologic. \nThe FDA may grant “fast track” status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product’s development plan and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of an NDA or BLA for FDA review \n22\nbefore the entire submission is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval.\n“Breakthrough Therapy” designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs or biologics that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all of the benefits of fast-track designation in addition to robust FDA-sponsor interaction and communication to help to identify the most efficient and expeditious path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.\n“Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy,” (“RMAT”) designation is a process created by the 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016. A product is eligible for RMAT designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious disease or condition, and if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of RMAT designation include the benefits available to breakthrough therapies, including potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. \nThe FDA may grant “priority review” status to a product that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review an NDA or BLA, with the goal to take action on the application within six months from when the application is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review.\nManufacturing Quality Control\nAmong the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures continually conform with cGMP. Manufacturers must devote substantial time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control, and quality assurance to maintain cGMP compliance. Material changes in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, may result in additional regulatory review and approval. The FDA, and other regulatory agencies, conduct periodic visits to inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with the applicable regulations and requirements imposed when the product was approved, regulatory or judicial enforcement action may be initiated, which may include a warning letter, suspension of manufacturing, product seizure, or an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and/or recall of products previously shipped. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of our products. Future FDA, state, and foreign inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt manufacture or distribution of our products or require substantial resources to correct.\nPost-approval Requirements\nOnce an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, the sponsor of an approved drug in the U.S. may not promote that drug for unapproved, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an unapproved use in accordance with the practice of medicine. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of unapproved uses, as well as false or misleading promotion. Further, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. \nProducts we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:\n•    record-keeping requirements;\n•    reporting of adverse experiences with the product;\n•    providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;\n23\n•    drug sampling and distribution requirements;\n•    notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;\n•    complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and\n•    complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.\nFailure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the drug or biologic development process, approval process or after approval, may subject us or our collaborators to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:\n•    restrictions on marketing or manufacturing of the product; \n•    safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n•    refusal to approve or delay in review of pending applications;\n•    withdrawal of an approval or the implementation of limitations on a previously approved indication for use;\n•    imposition of a clinical hold, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) or other safety-related limitations;\n•    warning letters or “untitled letters;”\n•    product seizures, recalls, or detentions, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n•    total or partial suspension of production or distribution; \n•    consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or\n•    injunctions, fines, disgorgement, refusals of government contracts, or civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA typically advises that patients treated with gene therapy undergo follow-up observations for potential adverse events for a 15-year period. As part of the FDA approval of CASGEVY for the treatment of SCD and TDT, we are required to conduct two post-marketing requirement (“PMR”) safety studies to assess the long-term risk of hematologic malignancies and off-target genome editing effects by CRISPR/Cas9. Both PMR safety studies are consistent with the FDA’s guidance for industry on Long Term Follow-up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products. \nUnited States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity\nUpon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an IND for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years.\nIf the FDA approves a drug product that contains a new chemical entity not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. \nBiologics are also entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the “BPCIA”), which was passed as Title VII to the ACA. The law provides a pathway for approval of products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity, the period of time during which an innovator’s clinical data cannot be used by other companies, from the time of first licensure of the product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product \n24\nwas first licensed. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed below. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar. There have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts as well as judicial challenges seeking to repeal, modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. While none of those efforts have focused on changes to the provisions of the ACA related to the biosimilar regulatory framework, if the ACA is repealed, substantially modified, or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.\nIf the NDA or BLA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days each existing exclusivity (patent and regulatory) related to the product.\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. \nIf a drug or biologic that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug or biologic for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our products for seven years if a competitor first obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, for the same disease or condition for which we were seeking approval. KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO, TRIKAFTA, ALYFTREK and CASGEVY have been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA.\nWe may pursue orphan drug designation for certain of our future product candidates. Even if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the product candidate for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing novel therapies. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent different drugs from being approved for the same condition. Moreover, orphan drug exclusivity may not prevent the approval of another sponsor’s product that is considered to be the same drug for a different disease or condition, even where such product could be prescribed for an unapproved indication that is protected by orphan drug exclusivity. Even after an orphan drug is approved, regulators may subsequently approve the same drug made by another manufacturer for the same condition if the regulator concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug or biologic nor gives the drug or biologic any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nForeign Regulation\nWe conduct clinical trials and market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have clinical trial, product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Thus, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the E.U., before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.\nUnder the E.U. regulatory system, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for orphan medicines, medicines produced by biotechnology, and those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes, and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. In addition to the centralized procedure, the E.U. also has a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision.\n25\nAdditionally, our European headquarters and European research facility are located in the U.K. Despite the U.K. formally withdrawing from the E.U. on January 31, 2020, a number of E.U. regulations were retained in U.K. law. The U.K. government has communicated an intent to remove or replace some of these E.U. provisions, which may increase some regulatory divergence between the U.K. and the E.U. Given the uncertainty as to what changes may be incorporated into U.K. law, it is unclear if any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRegulations Concerning Reimbursement\nSales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products will be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed health care organizations. Increasingly, these third-party payors are becoming stricter in the ways they evaluate and reimburse medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of many governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our revenues. Decisions by third-party payors to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product.\nIn the U.S., we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, Medicare, and other governmental pricing programs. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low-income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs, which includes select inpatient drugs for which there is “direct reimbursement.” Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid and Medicare programs. \nAny company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also must participate in the 340B drug pricing program (the “340B program”), and the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, requires participating companies to agree to charge statutorily defined “covered entities” no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for covered outpatient drugs. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on pricing data calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The FSS pricing program, which is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), also requires participating companies to extend discounted prices to the VA, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and Public Health Service. Similar to the 340B program, FSS prices are calculated utilizing pricing data reported by us to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis.\nThe Medicare program includes “Part A” that generally covers certain hospital services for eligible beneficiaries. In general, Part A covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing, and hospice care. Most individuals are enrolled in Medicare Part A upon reaching age 65 (although other individuals qualify for Part A, including those receiving services for end stage renal disease). Prescription drugs that are used as part of an inpatient hospital stay will be covered by Medicare Part A, and these products typically are paid as part of a bundled or composite rate (e.g., diagnosis related group).\nThe Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under “Part D,” Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs such as our acute pain and CF medicines. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutics committee. U.S. government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. \nPrivate payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. As a result, any reduction in payment that results from Part D reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors for our products. Additionally, private payors, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S., are adopting more aggressive utilization management techniques, and are increasingly applying restrictive plan designs that can impact patients and manufacturers and they continue to push for significant discounts and rebates from manufacturers. As a consequence, these payors may not cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at levels that disadvantage them relative to competitive products.\n26\nThe U.S. government has shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs for medicines and has enacted reforms at the state and federal level designed to, among other things, modify prescription drug reimbursement amounts and methodologies, and otherwise control health care costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) was enacted in March 2010 and was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA was designed to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs, impose an annual fee on branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, subject biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. Additionally, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted, establishing a Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, a Medicare inflationary rebate, and a redesign of the Part D benefit structure. Certain drugs, including our CF medicines and CASGEVY, are excluded from the IRA negotiation program. Nevertheless, other elements of the IRA may have a material impact on our business, including the redesign of the Part D benefit and the new Manufacturer Discount Program, which will require manufacturers to take on more of the beneficiary cost previously subsidized by the federal government through the application of increased drug discounts. Under the Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (“NOPAIN”) Act, CMS reimbursement for novel, oral, non-opioids will include an add-on payment when the drug is used in the hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings. We expect that JOURNAVX, our recently approved medicine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain, will qualify for inclusion on the list of applicable drugs under the NOPAIN Act. \nWe anticipate that the U.S. government will continue to engage in activities seeking to address drug pricing and reimbursement. Furthermore, certain states have enacted laws establishing Prescription Drug Affordability Boards (“PDABs”). Some state PDABs, including those in Colorado, Maryland, Washington, and Minnesota, either have the authority or have defined a pathway pursuant to which they may be granted the authority to establish upper payment limits for prescription drugs. In certain states, there is pending litigation that would establish a PDAB or expand the authority of an existing PDAB.\nIn Europe and other foreign jurisdictions, the success of our products depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because patients are generally unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a new product may begin while pricing and reimbursement terms are under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete reimbursement negotiations prior to the commencement of commercial supply of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely country-by-country and region-by-region. For example, the member states of the E.U. can restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and can control the prices of prescription drugs. In addition, many ex-U.S. government payors require companies to provide health economic assessments of products, which are evaluated by government agencies set up for this purpose. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the total amount of money that a company may receive for supply of a drug. Countries also may consider increasing mandatory discounts over time in an attempt to manage increased demands on healthcare budgets. Reimbursement discussions in foreign countries often result in a reimbursement price that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the product in the U.S. In addition, reimbursement discussions may take a significant period of time resulting in commercialization delays. In some countries where reimbursement has not yet been obtained, or where there are a limited number of eligible people and our medicines or therapies are unregistered, the governments of such countries may agree to purchase our medicines and therapies on an unlicensed and/or named patient basis. Reimbursement for our products cannot be assured because a country or region may only provide for reimbursement on terms that we do not deem adequate. Further, many ex-U.S. governments have introduced or are in the process of introducing legislation focusing on cost containment measures in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of these laws where finalized, the final form of laws under consideration, and their relevant practical application, are unknown at this time, but may lead to lower prices, paybacks, or other forms of discounts or special taxes.\nOther Regulations\nPharmaceutical companies are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the False Claims Act (“FCA”), and other state and federal laws and regulations. In the U.S., the Anti-Kickback Statute generally makes it illegal to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in return for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal health care program. The FCA prohibits knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary \n27\nitems or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the FCA may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity, manufacturing regulations, or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.\nLaws and regulations also have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers, require manufacturers to adopt certain compliance standards or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include U.S. federal and state “sunshine” provisions. The federal sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, physicians assistants, advanced practice registered nurses, and teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain requirements that are subject to interpretation. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.\nWe are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. We are also subject to U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (“the Bribery Act”), which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the U.K. generally will be subject to the Bribery Act.\nOur collection and use of personal data as part of our business activities is subject to various privacy and data security laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies, in the U.S., E.U., U.K., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and other jurisdictions. Such laws and regulations have the potential to affect our business materially, continue to evolve and increasingly are being enforced.\nOur present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances are or may be applicable to our activities. In addition, as we expand our pipeline and contemplate different approaches that may incorporate the use of medical devices, such approaches may necessitate compliance with regulatory laws applicable to medical devices, including those governing the testing, manufacture, approval, distribution, and marketing of medical devices. Furthermore, the extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.\nWe have a global corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent, and mitigate healthcare fraud and abuse risk through, among other things, the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. We will continue to devote substantial resources to enhance and expand our corporate compliance program as necessary to help us manage and mitigate our evolving compliance risk environment as our business grows and expands globally. Even with these measures, however, we cannot guarantee compliance with the various complex laws and regulations to which we are subject now or in the future.\nEMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 6,100 employees. Of these employees, approximately 5,100 were based in the U.S. and approximately 1,000 were based outside the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective \n28\nbargaining agreement. A small number of employees outside the U.S. are covered by such agreements due to local law or industry requirements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry and from universities and research institutions. At times, when industry conditions are positive, we may face challenges in recruiting and retaining employees across the biotechnology industry due to industry job market dynamics.\nWe rely on skilled, experienced, and innovative employees to conduct the operations of our company. The biotechnology industry is very competitive, and recruiting and retaining such employees is important to the continued success of our business. We are committed to building an outstanding, committed, and passionate team, and we focus on a culture that values all employees. We focus on recruiting, retaining, and developing qualified and talented employees from a diverse range of backgrounds to conduct our research, development, commercial, and other business activities because we believe that each employee brings unique perspectives and strengths, and by embracing these strengths, we can do our best work for patients. \nWe view diversity through a broad lens that encompasses culture, backgrounds, experiences, and worldview to foster creativity and innovation. Our initiatives include learning, resources, and forums that promote belonging in our workplaces; five global employee resource networks that promote connectivity and collaboration across levels and functions; and investments to support equal opportunity in our surrounding communities. \nTo promote our employees’ continued well-being, we offer comprehensive benefits and resources, including those focused on health and income protection, such as life insurance and retirement savings programs. We continue to promote and enhance wellness tools supporting our employees’ mental, social, physical and financial health. We continually review and augment our programs to include benefits that support the evolving needs of our workforce. \nIn addition, we provide our employees with career development and advancement opportunities, including job rotations, mentoring, and managerial training. We are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders and have developed programs focused on manager excellence, talent and succession for critical roles in our organization. \nOTHER MATTERS\nFinancial Information and Significant Customers\nWe operate in one segment, pharmaceuticals.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2024 as compared to 2023 are discussed below. For a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2023 as compared to 2022, please refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as set forth below.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative \nmedicines \nfor people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. We have seven approved medicines: five that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (“CF”), a life-threatening genetic disease, one that treats severe sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (“TDT”), life shortening inherited blood disorders, and one that treats moderate-to-severe acute pain. Our clinical-stage pipeline includes programs in CF, SCD, beta thalassemia, acute and peripheral neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, IgA nephropathy and other autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, type 1 diabetes, myotonic dystrophy type 1, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.\n In December 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved ALYFTREK (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor), our once-daily next-in-class triple combination for the treatment of people with CF 6 years of age and older, and our fifth CF medicine. Collectively, our five medicines, led by TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), are being used to treat nearly three quarters of the approximately 94,000 people with CF in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada. Through approvals of new medicines, label expansions, and expanded reimbursement, we are focused on increasing the number of people with CF who are eligible and able to receive our medicines. In December 2024, the FDA approved the expanded use of TRIKAFTA for the treatment of people with CF 2 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene or a mutation that is responsive to TRIKAFTA. With this approval, 94 additional non-F508del CFTR mutations have been added to the TRIKAFTA label, and approximately 300 additional people with CF in the U.S. are now eligible for TRIKAFTA. In addition, we are evaluating our CF medicines in additional patient populations, including younger children, with the goal of having small molecule treatments for all people who have at least one mutation in their CFTR gene that is responsive to our CFTR modulators. We also are pursuing messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”) and genetic therapies for people with CF who do not make full-length CFTR protein and, as a result, cannot benefit from our current CF medicines.\nCASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel), our ex-vivo, non-viral CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy, is approved in the U.S., the European Union (“E.U.”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (“Saudi Arabia”), the Kingdom of Bahrain (“Bahrain”), the United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”), Switzerland and Canada for the treatment of people 12 years of age and older with SCD or TDT. We estimate approximately 60,000 people with severe SCD or TDT are or could become eligible for CASGEVY in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. \nIn January 2025, the FDA approved JOURNAVX, our selective non-opioid NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of people with moderate-to-severe acute pain. We have begun our commercial launch of JOURNAVX in the U.S. for eligible adults. In addition, we are enrolling and dosing patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating suzetrigine for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain. In December 2024, we announced Phase 2 clinical trial results showing that treatment with suzetrigine demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful within-group reduction in pain on the numeric pain rating scale for people with lumbosacral radiculopathy (“LSR”), a form of peripheral neuropathic pain. The clinical trial also included a placebo reference arm, which showed a similar within-group reduction. Suzetrigine was safe and generally well-tolerated in the Phase 2 clinical trial. We hypothesize that a high placebo response in this clinical trial led to a lack of separation of the suzetrigine and placebo response curves. We believe we can innovate in pain clinical trial design to better control the placebo effect, and succeed in pivotal development with suzetrigine. We plan to advance suzetrigine into pivotal development in LSR, pending discussions with regulators on trial design and the regulatory package.\n70\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenues\nIn 2024, our net product revenues increased to $11.0 billion as compared to $9.9 billion in 2023, primarily due to increased TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO product revenues resulting from strong performance and demand globally, including expansions into younger age groups and label extensions, and higher net realized pricing in the U.S.\nExpenses\nOur total research and development (“R&D”), and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased to $5.1 billion in 2024 as compared to $4.3 billion in 2023, primarily due to continued investment to support additional therapies in mid-to-late stage development and increased commercial investments to support launches of our therapies globally. In 2024, total acquired in-process research and development expenses (“AIPR&D”) of $4.6 billion included $4.4 billion related to our acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (“Alpine”). Cost of sales were 14% of our net product revenues in 2024 as compared to 13% in 2023, with the increase primarily due to costs associated with CASGEVY.\nCash\nOur total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 as compared to $13.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 primarily due to cash paid to acquire Alpine and repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by cash flows provided by other operating activities.\nNote: Charts above may not add due to rounding.\nBusiness Updates\nMarketed Products\nCystic Fibrosis\nWe expect to grow our CF business by increasing the number of people with CF who are eligible and able to receive our medicines. \nWe have revised estimates for the number of people with CF in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada from approximately 92,000 to approximately 94,000 people. Additionally, we continue to secure formal reimbursement in multiple additional countries that collectively comprise approximately 15,000 additional people with CF. Approximately 10,000 of those additional people with CF are eligible for treatment with CFTR modulators. We previously served many of these markets through named patient sales. \nRecent progress in activities expanding our CF business is included below:\n•\nIn December 2024, the FDA approved ALYFTREK (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor), the once-daily next-in-class combination CFTR modulator for the treatment of people with CF 6 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation or another mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ALYFTREK, which includes a total of 303 CFTR mutations. Regulatory submissions for ALYFTREK, including in the U.K., the E.U., Canada, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand, are currently under review.\n71\n•\nIn December 2024, the FDA approved the expanded use of TRIKAFTA for the treatment of people with CF with 94 additional non-F508del CFTR mutations. TRIKAFTA is now approved in the U.S. for a total of 272 CFTR mutations. We have also submitted regulatory applications to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO for the treatment of people with CF and rare responsive mutations.\n•\nWe entered into an extended long-term reimbursement agreement with NHS England providing access to KAFTRIO, SYMKEVI and ORKAMBI, and continued access to KALYDECO, for existing and future eligible CF patients in England. We have entered into similar reimbursement agreements in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. These reimbursement agreements include access to any future license extensions of these medicines.\n•\nKAFTRIO is reimbursed in all 27 countries of the E.U.\nSickle Cell Disease and Beta Thalassemia\n•\nCASGEVY is now approved in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Canada and Switzerland for people 12 years of age and older with SCD or TDT. \n•\nWe have activated more than 50 authorized treatment centers globally, and more than 50 patients have initiated cell collection. We expect significant growth in the number of new patients initiating cell collection throughout 2025.\n•\nWe entered into a reimbursement agreement with NHS England for eligible people with SCD to access CASGEVY, consistent with the reimbursement agreement reached in August 2024 with NHS England for eligible people with TDT to access CASGEVY.\n•\nThe Italian Medicines Agency has approved early access for CASGEVY, on a case-by-case basis, for the treatment of people with TDT and SCD.\nAcute Pain\n•\nIn January 2025, the FDA approved JOURNAVX for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adults. We are working to secure broad stocking agreements for JOURNAVX with national retail pharmacies and regional pharmacy chains. We expect to begin shipping JOURNAVX to pharmacies nationwide by the end of February, with retail availability beginning shortly thereafter.\n•\nWe expect that JOURNAVX will be qualified for the add-on payment under the Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (“NOPAIN”) Act, which provides for a separate payment in the hospital outpatient or surgical center setting for FDA-approved non-opioid treatments for pain.\nPipeline\nWe continue to advance a diversified pipeline of potentially transformative medicines for serious diseases utilizing a range of modalities. Recent and anticipated progress in activities supporting these efforts is included below: \nCystic Fibrosis\n•\nWe are enrolling and dosing in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ALYFTREK in children with CF 2 to 5 years of age who have at least one F508del mutation or a mutation responsive to triple combination CFTR modulators.\n•\nIn collaboration with Moderna, Inc. (“Moderna”), we are developing VX-522, a CFTR mRNA therapeutic for the treatment of people with CF who do not produce full-length CFTR protein. \nThe multiple ascending dose portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for VX-522 is underway, with data expected in the first half of 2025. In the U.S., the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for VX-522.\n•\nWe continue to advance new oral small molecule combination therapies through preclinical and clinical development with the aim of achieving normal levels of CFTR function. The most advanced of the next generation of CFTR modulators have completed, or are in the process of completing, Phase 1 clinical trials. We also are investigating additional potential treatments for people with CF who do not make full-length CFTR protein and cannot benefit from CFTR modulators.\n72\nSickle Cell Disease and Beta Thalassemia\n•\nWe have completed enrollment of children 5 to 11 years of age with SCD or TDT in two global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating CASGEVY, and we expect to complete dosing of this age group in 2025.\n•\nWe continue to advance preclinical assets for myeloablative conditioning agents that would have milder side-effects and could be used in connection with CASGEVY, which could broaden the eligible patient population. \nAcute Pain\n•\nWe are enrolling and dosing patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating an oral formulation of VX-993, a next-generation selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain following bunionectomy surgery.\n•\nWe are enrolling and dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an intravenous formulation of VX-993.\n•\nThe FDA has granted Fast Track Designation to VX-993 in moderate-to-severe acute pain in both the oral and intravenous formulations.\n•\nWe are advancing multiple NaV1.7 inhibitors, including in combination with NaV1.8 inhibitors, through research and earlier stages of development for both acute and peripheral neuropathic pain.\nPeripheral Neuropathic Pain\n•\nA Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating suzetrigine is enrolling and dosing patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain. The FDA has granted suzetrigine Breakthrough Therapy designation in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n•\nIn December 2024, we announced Phase 2 clinical trial results for suzetrigine as a treatment for LSR, a form of peripheral neuropathic pain. The clinical trial met its primary endpoint, but the suzetrigine arm did not separate from the placebo reference arm. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating suzetrigine in LSR, pending discussions with regulators on the regulatory package and optimized trial design. \n•\nWe are enrolling and dosing patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the oral formulation of VX-993, a next generation NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\nAPOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease\n•\nInaxaplin is our small molecule for the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney disease (“AMKD”). We continue to enroll and dose people with AMKD in the Phase 3 portion of the global Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial (“AMPLITUDE”). We expect to complete enrollment in the interim analysis cohort in 2025 and apply for potential accelerated approval in the U.S., assuming a positive interim analysis.\n•\nWe initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial (“AMPLIFIED”) evaluating inaxaplin as a treatment for people with AMKD and diabetes or other co-morbidities who are not currently eligible for the AMPLITUDE Phase 2/3 pivotal trial. \n•\nThe FDA granted\n \nBreakthrough Therapy designation to inaxaplin for APOL1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (“FSGS”) and the EMA granted Orphan Drug and PRIME designations to inaxaplin for AMKD. \nIgA Nephropathy and Other B Cell-Mediated Diseases\n•\nIn May 2024, we acquired Alpine, whose lead compound was povetacicept, a dual inhibitor of B cell activating factor (“BAFF”) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (“APRIL”) pathways. We are developing povetacicept as a potentially best-in-class approach to treat immunoglobulin A (“IgA”) nephropathy (“IgAN”), a serious progressive, autoimmune kidney disease that can lead to end-stage renal disease. \n•\nWe are enrolling and dosing patients in the U.S., Europe and Asia in our global pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating povetacicept in people with IgAN (“RAINIER”). The trial is designed to have a pre-planned interim analysis \n73\nevaluating the change from baseline in urine protein creatinine ratio (“UPCR”) after a certain number of patients reach 36 weeks of treatment. If positive, the interim analysis may serve as the basis for seeking accelerated approval in the U.S. Final analysis will occur at two years of treatment, with a primary endpoint of total eGFR slope through Week 104. We expect to complete enrollment in the interim analysis cohort in 2025 and apply for potential accelerated approval in the U.S., assuming a positive interim analysis.\n•\nWe are evaluating povetacicept as a potential treatment for additional B cell-mediated renal diseases in the RUBY-3 basket trial and hematologic conditions in the RUBY-4 basket trial. Both of these trials are ongoing\n, and we expect data in some of these conditions in 2025. \nType 1 Diabetes\n•\nZimislecel is an allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, using standard immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells. We are evaluating zimislecel as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes (“T1D”) in a sequential, three-part Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We expect to complete enrollment and dosing in the Phase 3 portion of this Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial in 2025 and, assuming positive data, we expect to file for potential approval after patients have completed one year of insulin-free follow-up. In addition, we have initiated a clinical trial evaluating zimislecel in people with T1D who have had a kidney transplant. \n•\nOur second program in T1D evaluates VX-264, which encapsulates zimislecel in a novel device designed to eliminate the need for immunosuppression. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VX-264. We have completed Part A of this clinical trial and we are enrolling and dosing people with TID in Part B of the clinical trial, where patients receive the full-target dose with a stagger period between patients. Part C will dose at a full target dose without a stagger between patients. We expect to share Part B full-dose data from this clinical trial in 2025. \n•\nOur hypoimmune islet cell program uses CRISPR/Cas9 technology to gene-edit the same allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islets used in the zimislecel and VX-264 programs. The goal is to cloak the cells from the immune system to explore another possible path to eliminate the need for immunosuppressive therapy. This program continues to progress through the research stage. We are also pursuing alternative approaches to immunosuppression that could be used with zimislecel. \nMyotonic Dystrophy Type 1\n•\nOur lead approach for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (“DM1”), VX-670, was in-licensed from Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. (“Entrada”). VX-670 is an oligonucleotide connected to a cyclic peptide to promote effective delivery into cells, which holds the potential to address the underlying cause of DM1.\n•\nWe completed the single ascending dose portion of the global Phase 1/2 clinical trial for VX-670 in people with DM1. We are enrolling and dosing the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-670. \nAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\n•\nWe are nearing completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VX-407 in healthy volunteers, our first-in-class small molecule corrector that targets the underlying cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (“ADPKD”) in people with a subset of PKD1 variants. In 2025, we expect to advance VX-407 into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in people with ADPKD.\nExternal Innovation\nRecent investments in external innovation are included below.\n•\nIn January 2025, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai Lab Limited (“Zai”) for the development and commercialization of povetacicept in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan region and Singapore. Under this collaboration, Zai will help advance the povetacicept clinical trials, make the regulatory submissions in these territories, and will be responsible for commercialization activities in these territories, if povetacicept becomes an approved product. \n74\n•\nIn December 2024, we entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Orna Therapeutics (“Orna”) to utilize Orna’s novel and proprietary lipid nanoparticle delivery solutions to enhance our efforts in developing next generation gene-editing therapies for patients with SCD and TDT.\nOur Business Environment\nIn 2024, our net product revenues came primarily from the sale of our medicines for the treatment of CF. Our CF strategy involves continuing to develop and obtain approval and reimbursement for treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all people with CF and increasing the number of people with CF eligible and able to receive our medicines. We are continuing to progress commercialization of CASGEVY, which has received marketing approvals in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Switzerland and Canada for the treatment of SCD and TDT. In addition, we have begun our commercial launch of JOURNAVX for the treatment of acute pain, which received marketing approval in the U.S. in January 2025. We also continue to advance our pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of serious diseases outside of CF, SCD, TDT, and acute pain.\nOur strategy is to combine transformative advances in the understanding of causal human biology and the science of therapeutics to discover and develop innovative medicines. This approach includes advancing multiple compounds or therapies from each program, spanning multiple modalities, into early clinical trials to obtain patient data that can inform selection of the most promising therapies for later-stage development, as well as to inform discovery and development efforts. We aim to rapidly follow our first-in-class therapies that achieve proof-of-concept with potential best-in-class candidates to provide durable clinical and commercial success.\nIn pursuit of new product candidates and therapies in specialty markets, we invest in research and development. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in product development and may provide product candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. To supplement our internal research programs, we acquire technologies and programs and collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations, as needed, to advance research in our areas of therapeutic interest and to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy.\nDiscovery and development of a new pharmaceutical or biological product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise. Across the industry, most potential drug or biological products never progress into development, and most products that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. Our investments in product candidates are subject to considerable risks. We closely monitor our research and development activities, and frequently evaluate our pipeline programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. This process can result in rapid changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.\nOur business also requires ensuring appropriate manufacturing and supply of our products. As we advance our product candidates through clinical development toward commercialization and market and sell our approved products, we build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. We rely on a global network of third parties, including some in China, and our internal capabilities to manufacture and distribute our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials and to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials. In addition to establishing supply chains for each new approved product, we adapt our supply chain for existing products to include additional formulations or to increase scale of production for existing products as needed. Our foreign third-party manufacturers and suppliers may be subject to U.S. legislation, including the BIOSECURE Act, sanctions, trade restrictions and other foreign regulatory requirements which could increase costs or reduce the supply of material available to us, or delay the procurement or supply of such material. The processes for biological and cell and genetic therapies can be more complex than those required for small molecule drugs and require additional investments in different systems, equipment, facilities and expertise. We are focused on ensuring the stability of the supply chains for our current products, as well as for our pipeline programs. \nSales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. Reimbursement for our products, including our potential pipeline therapies, cannot be assured and may take significant periods of time to obtain. We dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets.\n75\nIn the U.S., we have worked successfully with third-party payors to promptly obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our CF medicines. In addition, we are working with U.S. government and commercial payors with respect to CASGEVY and JOURNAVX. We anticipate broad access with government and commercial payors for CASGEVY in the U.S., and we have recently entered into multiple agreements with government and commercial health insurance providers to provide such access. For JOURNAVX in the U.S., we have been working with government and commercial payors pre- and post-approval to support rapid and broad access. We plan to continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states, to ensure that payors recognize the significant benefits that all our therapies provide and provide patients with appropriate levels of access to our medicines and therapies now and in the future. We cannot, however, predict how changes in the law, including through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and passage of state laws (e.g., transparency laws and prescription drug affordability boards), will affect our ability to negotiate successfully with third-party payors and distribute our products. Similarly, in ex-U.S. markets, we seek government reimbursement for our medicines on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis, as required. This is necessary for each new medicine, as well as for label expansions for our current medicines. We are working with ex-U.S. payors with respect to CASGEVY, and we are pursuing long-term reimbursement agreements. We have secured reimbursed access for people with SCD or TDT in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Luxembourg, and England. In addition, the Italian Medicines Agency has approved early access for CASGEVY, on a case-by-case basis, to treat people with SCD and TDT. We expect to continue to focus significant resources to expand and maintain reimbursement for our CF medicines, CASGEVY, JOURNAVX, and, ultimately, our pipeline therapies, in U.S. and ex-U.S. markets.\nStrategic Transactions\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire technologies, products, product candidates and other businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. We have acquired multiple biotechnology companies over the last several years and expect to continue to identify and evaluate such opportunities. The accounting for these acquisitions can vary significantly based on whether we conclude the transactions represent business combinations or asset acquisitions. In 2024, we acquired Alpine for approximately $5.0 billion in cash. Alpine’s lead molecule, povetacicept, has shown potential to treat multiple diseases or conditions and become a pipeline-in-a-product. We accounted for the Alpine transaction as an asset acquisition because povetacicept represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets that we acquired. As a result, $4.4 billion of the fair value attributed to povetacicept was expensed as AIPR&D in 2024. In 2019 and 2022, we acquired Semma Therapeutics, Inc. (“Semma”) and ViaCyte, Inc. (“ViaCyte”), respectively, pursuant to which we established and accelerated the development of our T1D program. We accounted for each of these acquisitions as a business combination.\nPlease refer to our critical accounting policies, “Acquisitions,” for further information regarding the significant judgments and estimates related to our acquisitions.\nCollaboration and In-Licensing Arrangements\nWe enter into arrangements with third parties, including collaboration and licensing arrangements, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of products, product candidates, and other technologies that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts.\nOver the last several years, we entered into collaboration agreements with a number of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics AG (“CRISPR”), Entrada, and Moderna. Generally, when we in-license a technology or product candidate, we make upfront payments to the collaborator, assume the costs of the program and/or agree to make contingent payments, which could consist of milestone, royalty and option payments. Most of these collaboration payments are expensed as AIPR&D, including, a $75.0 million milestone paid to Entrada in 2024, and, in 2023, total payments of $242.6 million to Entrada and total upfront and milestone payments of $170.0 million to CRISPR related to T1D. These payments were expensed to AIPR&D because they were primarily attributable to acquired in-process research and development for which there was no alternative future use. However, depending on many factors, including the structure of the collaboration, the stage of development of the acquired technology, the significance of the in-licensed product candidate to the collaborator’s operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged, the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly. We expect to continue to identify and evaluate collaboration and licensing opportunities that may be similar to or different from the collaborations and licenses that we have engaged in previously.\n76\nJoint Development and Commercialization Agreement with CRISPR\nIn 2017, we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement with CRISPR (the “CRISPR JDCA”), which we amended and restated in 2021.\nPursuant to the CRISPR JDCA, we lead global development, manufacturing and commercialization of CASGEVY, with support from CRISPR. We also conduct all research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities relating to other product candidates and products under the CRISPR JDCA throughout the world subject to CRISPR’s reserved right to conduct certain activities.\nCASGEVY was approved by the FDA in December 2023 for the treatment of SCD. In connection with this approval, we made a $200.0 million milestone payment to CRISPR in January 2024, which we accrued to “Other current liabilities” and recorded within “Other intangible assets, net” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. We are recording intangible asset amortization expense to “Cost of sales” related to this intangible asset. Subsequent to receiving marketing approval for CASGEVY, we continue to lead the research and development activities under the CRISPR JDCA, subject to CRISPR’s reserved right to conduct certain activities. We are reimbursed by CRISPR for its 40% share of these research and development activities, subject to certain adjustments, and we record this reimbursement from CRISPR as a credit within “Research and development expenses.” We also share with CRISPR 40% of the net commercial profits or losses incurred with respect to CASGEVY, subject to certain adjustments, which is recorded to “Cost of sales.” The net commercial profits or losses equal the sum of the product revenues, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses that we have recognized related to the CRISPR JDCA.\nPrior to receiving marketing approval from the FDA for CASGEVY in December 2023, we accounted for the CRISPR JDCA as a cost-sharing arrangement, with costs incurred related to CASGEVY allocated 60% to us and 40% to CRISPR, subject to certain adjustments. In 2023 and 2022, we recognized net reimbursements from CRISPR as credits to “Research and development expenses” and to “Selling, general and administrative expenses,” related to CRISPR’s share of the CRISPR JDCA’s operating expenses.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nIn 2024 and 2023, our AIPR&D included $4.6 billion and $527.1 million, respectively, related to upfront, contingent milestone, or other payments pursuant to our business development transactions, including the asset acquisitions, collaborations, and licenses of third-party technologies described above. Please refer to Note B, “Collaboration, License and Other Arrangements,” for further information regarding our asset acquisitions, collaboration, in-license agreements.\nOut-licensing Arrangements\nWe also have out-licensed certain development programs to collaborators who are leading the development or commercialization of these programs, either globally or within certain geographic regions. Pursuant to these out-licensing arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for the research, development, and commercialization costs associated with these programs, and we are entitled to receive contingent milestone and/or royalty payments. As a result, we do not expect to incur significant expenses in connection with these programs and have the potential for future collaborative and royalty revenues resulting from these programs. None of our out-license agreements had a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations during the three years ended December 31, 2024.\nAs noted above, in January 2025, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai for the development and commercialization of povetacicept in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan region and Singapore. \n77\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages and per share amounts)\nProduct revenues, net\n$\n11,020.1 \n12%\n$\n9,869.2 \n11%\n$\n8,930.7 \nAcquired in-process research and development expenses\n4,628.4 \n**\n527.1 \n356%\n115.5 \nOther operating costs and expenses\n6,624.6 \n20%\n5,510.1 \n22%\n4,507.8 \n(Loss) income from operations\n(232.9)\n(106)%\n3,832.0 \n(11)%\n4,307.4 \nOther non-operating income (expense), net\n481.4 \n(12)%\n547.8 \n**\n(75.0)\nProvision for income taxes\n784.1 \n3%\n760.2 \n(16)%\n910.4 \nNet (loss) income\n$\n(535.6)\n(115)%\n$\n3,619.6 \n9%\n$\n3,322.0 \nNet (loss) income per diluted common share\n$\n(2.08)\n$\n13.89 \n$\n12.82 \nDiluted shares used in per share calculations\n257.9 \n260.5 \n259.1 \n** Not meaningful\nRevenues\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nTRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO\n$\n10,238.6 \n14%\n$\n8,944.7 \n16%\n$\n7,686.8 \nOther product revenues\n781.5 \n(15)%\n924.5 \n(26)%\n1,243.9 \nTotal revenues\n$\n11,020.1 \n12%\n$\n9,869.2 \n11%\n$\n8,930.7 \nProduct Revenues, Net\nIn 2024, our net product revenues increased by $1.2 billion, or 12%, as compared to 2023. Increases in our TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO product revenues were due to strong performance and demand globally, including expansions into younger age groups and label extensions, and higher net realized pricing in the U.S. The decrease in our “Other product revenues” was primarily the result of CF patients switching to TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO from our other CF products. In 2024, “Other product revenues” included $10.0 million related to CASGEVY. There were no ALYFTREK sales in 2024.\nOur net product revenues from the U.S. and from ex-U.S. markets were as follows: \n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nUnited States\n$\n6,684.9 \n11%\n$\n6,040.4 \n6%\n$\n5,699.3 \nex-U.S.\n4,335.2 \n13%\n3,828.8 \n18%\n3,231.4 \nProduct revenues, net\n$\n11,020.1 \n12%\n$\n9,869.2 \n11%\n$\n8,930.7 \nIn 2025, we expect our net product revenues to increase due to the approval of ALYFTREK for CF in the U.S., continued demand globally for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, including in younger age groups and from label expansions, increased CASGEVY patient infusions, and contribution from the launch of JOURNAVX.\n78\nOperating Costs and Expenses\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nCost of sales\n$\n1,530.5 \n21%\n$\n1,262.2 \n17%\n$\n1,080.3 \nResearch and development expenses\n3,630.3 \n15%\n3,162.9 \n25%\n2,540.3 \nAcquired in-process research and development expenses\n4,628.4 \n**\n527.1 \n356%\n115.5 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n1,464.3 \n29%\n1,136.6 \n20%\n944.7 \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n(0.5)\n**\n(51.6)\n**\n(57.5)\nTotal costs and expenses\n$\n11,253.0 \n86%\n$\n6,037.2 \n31%\n$\n4,623.3 \n** Not meaningful\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales primarily consists of third-party royalties payable on net sales of our CF products as well as the cost of producing inventories. Pursuant to our agreement with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of ALYFTREK, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, KALYDECO, and ORKAMBI, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens, with lower royalties on sales of ALYFTREK and TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO than for our other products. Over the last several years, our cost of sales has been increasing due to increased net product revenues. Our cost of sales as a percentage of our net product revenues was 14% and 13% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in costs of sales as a percentage of our net product revenues was primarily due to costs associated with CASGEVY following its regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2025, we expect our total cost of sales to increase due to expected increased net product revenues, CASGEVY contract manufacturing costs, and costs associated with JOURNAVX, partially offset by lower royalties due to sales of ALYFTREK.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nResearch expenses\n$\n804.5 \n14%\n$\n705.6 \n13%\n$\n626.7 \nDevelopment expenses\n2,825.8 \n15%\n2,457.3 \n28%\n1,913.6 \nTotal research and development expenses\n$\n3,630.3 \n15%\n$\n3,162.9 \n25%\n$\n2,540.3 \nOur research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our products and product candidates. We do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual products or product candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. We assign external costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research by individual program. Our internal costs are greater than our external costs. All research and development costs for our products and product candidates are expensed as incurred.\nOver the past three years, we have incurred $9.3 billion in research and development expenses associated with product discovery and development. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. In addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and the disease indication being targeted. The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. Therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our product candidates to market are not available. \n79\nAny estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our product candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. Until we have data from Phase 3 clinical trials, we cannot make a meaningful estimate regarding when, or if, a clinical development program will generate revenues and cash flows.\nResearch Expenses\n2024\nChange %\n2023\nChange %\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nResearch Expenses:\nSalary and benefits\n$\n210.7 \n14%\n$\n184.1 \n15%\n$\n159.5 \nStock-based compensation expense\n112.1 \n21%\n92.4 \n10%\n84.0 \nOutsourced services and other direct expenses\n271.4 \n15%\n237.0 \n25%\n189.6 \nIntangible asset impairment charge\n— \n**\n— \n**\n13.0 \nInfrastructure costs\n210.3 \n9%\n192.1 \n6%\n180.6 \nTotal research expenses\n$\n804.5 \n14%\n$\n705.6 \n13%\n$\n626.7 \n** Not meaningful\nOur research expenses have been increasing over the last several years as we invested in our pipeline and expanded our cell and genetic therapy capabilities, resulting in increased headcount and stock-based compensation expense, and outsourced services, other direct expenses, and infrastructure costs.

Growth in internal headcount over the last several years has increased our stock-based compensation expense, which has historically fluctuated and is expected to continue to fluctuate from one period to another based on the probability of achieving milestones associated with our performance-based awards. In 2024, development expenses also included compensation expense associated with cash-settled unvested equity awards related to our acquisition of Alpine. Outsourced services and other direct expenses in 2024 were similar to 2023 as increased expenses to support our T1D program were offset by the completion of our Phase 3 trials for ALYFTREK and JOURNAVX and the commercialization of CASGEVY. In 2025, we expect our development expenses to continue to increase due to our advancing pipeline programs, including our IgAN, pain and T1D programs.\n80\nAcquired In-process Research and Development Expenses\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses\n$\n4,628.4 \n**\n$\n527.1 \n356%\n$\n115.5 \n** Not meaningful\nIn 2024, AIPR&D included $4.4 billion resulting from our acquisition of Alpine, which was accounted for as an asset acquisition, the $75.0 million milestone to Entrada, and a $40.0 million upfront payment to Orna. In 2023, AIPR&D consisted of our $225.1 million upfront payment to Entrada, $100.0 million upfront payment and $70.0 million T1D research milestone to CRISPR, $47.5 million acquisition of a novel GPCR program from Septerna, and various other payments. Our AIPR&D has historically fluctuated, and is expected to continue to fluctuate, from one period to another due to upfront, contingent milestone, and other payments pursuant to our existing and future business development transactions, including collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n2024\n% Change\n2023\n% Change\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n1,464.3 \n29%\n$\n1,136.6 \n20%\n$\n944.7 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 29% in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to increased commercial investments to prepare for the launch of JOURNAVX and support the launch of CASGEVY, and stock-based compensation expense. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in 2025 to support these new product launches and additional investments in infrastructure to scale our organization.\nContingent Consideration \nIn 2024, the fair value of our contingent consideration decreased by $0.5 million. In 2023, the fair value of our contingent consideration decreased by $51.6 million primarily due to our determination that additional pre-clinical studies of the delivery system for our gene-editing components for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) would be required. In future periods, we expect the fair value of contingent consideration to increase or decrease based on, among other things, our estimates of the probability of achieving and the timing of these contingent development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as the time value of money and changes in market interest rates.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased from $614.7 million in 2023 to $598.1 million in 2024, primarily due to decreased cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities following our acquisition of Alpine in the second quarter of 2024. Our future interest income is dependent on the amount of, and prevailing market interest rates on, our outstanding cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities.\nInterest Expense \nInterest expense was $30.6 million in 2024, as compared to $44.1 million in 2023. The majority of our interest expense in these years was related to imputed interest expense associated with finance leases for our corporate headquarters in Boston. As discussed in Note L, “Leases,” our corporate headquarters leases were amended in August 2024, which resulted in an accounting classification change from finance to operating leases. As a result, we expect our interest expense to decrease in future periods because operating lease expenses are recorded within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\n81\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was expenses of $86.1 million and $22.8 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts primarily related to net unrealized losses resulting from changes in the fair value of certain of our strategic equity investments, which consist of investments in our collaborators that may be public or privately-held companies. To the extent that we continue to hold strategic equity investments in publicly traded biotechnology companies, we expect that our other income (expense), net will continue to fluctuate in future periods due to the volatility in the stock prices of these companies that impacts the fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of our investments in publicly traded companies was $36.6 million. We discuss these potential future fluctuations further in Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include changes in tax laws, variability in the amount and allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses, the levels of certain deductions and credits, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, acquisitions and third-party collaboration and licensing transactions.\nOur provision for income taxes was $784.1 million for 2024 and $760.2 million for 2023. In 2024, our 315.5% effective tax rate was materially different than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the $4.4 billion of non-deductible AIPR&D resulting from our acquisition of Alpine, which significantly lowered our pre-tax income. The non-deductible AIPR&D was partially offset by a benefit from a research and development tax credit study that was completed in 2024 and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nIn 2023, our 17.4% effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a benefit from a research and development tax credit study that was completed in 2023 and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table summarizes the components of our financial condition as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n4,569.6 \n$\n10,369.1 \nMarketable securities\n1,546.3 \n849.2 \nLong-term marketable securities\n5,107.9 \n2,497.8 \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n$\n11,223.8 \n$\n13,716.1 \n(18)%\nWorking Capital:\nTotal current assets\n$\n9,596.4 \n$\n14,144.2 \n(32)%\nTotal current liabilities\n(3,564.6)\n(3,547.4)\n—%\nTotal working capital\n$\n6,031.8 \n$\n10,596.8 \n(43)%\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, total working capital was $6.0 billion, which represented a decrease of $4.6 billion from $10.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 primarily due to cash paid to acquire Alpine.\n82\nCash Flows\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities\n$\n(492.6)\n$\n3,537.3 \n$\n4,129.9 \nInvesting activities\n$\n(3,770.0)\n$\n(3,141.7)\n$\n(321.1)\nFinancing activities\n$\n(1,494.9)\n$\n(562.2)\n$\n(67.7)\nOperating Activities \nCash used in operating activities was $492.6 million in 2024 as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $3.5 billion in 2023. The largest driver of the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was cash paid to acquire Alpine.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities were $3.8 billion and $3.1 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The largest portion of our investing activities in each year were net purchases of available-for-sale debt securities. \nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities were $1.5 billion and $562.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our financing activities in each year were primarily related to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and payments related to our employee stock benefit plans.\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\nWe intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities together with our operating profitability as our primary source of liquidity. We expect that cash flows from our product sales together with our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. The adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future sales of currently marketed products, and the potential introduction of one or more new product candidates to the market, our business development activities and the number, breadth and cost of our research and development programs.\nCredit Facilities & Financing Strategy\n We may borrow up to a total of $500.0 million pursuant to a revolving credit facility that we entered into in July 2022 and could repay and reborrow amounts under this revolving credit agreement without penalty. Subject to certain conditions, we could request that the borrowing capacity be increased by an additional $500.0 million, for a total of $1.0 billion. Negative covenants in our credit agreement could prohibit or limit our ability to access this source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, the facility was undrawn, and we were in compliance with these covenants.\nWe may also raise additional capital by borrowing under credit agreements, through public offerings or private placements of our securities, or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. We will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nWe have significant future capital requirements, including:\n•\nExpected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities, manufacture and commercialize our existing and future products, and to operate our organization.\n•\nCash that we pay for income taxes.\n•\nRoyalties we pay related to sales of our CF products.\n83\n•\nFacility, operating and finance lease obligations as described below.\n•\nFirm purchase obligations related to our supply and manufacturing processes.\nIn addition, other potential significant future capital requirements may include:\n•\nWe have entered into certain agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts. Certain of our transactions, including collaborations, licensing arrangements, and asset acquisitions, include the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets and/or commercial targets. Other transactions include the potential for future lease-related expenses and other costs. Our obligation to fund these research and development and commercialization efforts and to pay these potential milestones, expenses and royalties is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause their discontinuance. We may enter into additional agreements, including acquisitions, collaborations, licensing arrangements and equity investments, which require additional capital.\n•\nTo the extent we borrow amounts under our existing credit agreement, we would be required to repay any outstanding principal amounts in 2027.\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $1.4 billion remaining authorization available under our $3.0 billion Share Repurchase Program that our Board of Directors approved in February 2023. This program does not have an expiration date and can be discontinued at any time. We expect to fund these programs through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated by operations. \nAdditional information on several of our future capital requirements is provided below.\nResearch and Development Costs\nWe have ongoing clinical trials of product candidates at various stages of clinical development. Our clinical trial costs are dependent on, among other things, the size, number, and length of our clinical trials. These costs can increase as product candidates move from earlier-stage clinical trials into later-stage clinical development.\nLeases\nWe account for the majority of our real estate leases and each of our embedded leases with contract manufacturing organizations as operating leases. These include leases for our corporate headquarters at Fan Pier in Boston, Massachusetts and office and laboratory space at the Jeffrey Leiden Center for Cell and Genetic Therapies (the “Jeffrey Leiden Center”) near our corporate headquarters. We amended our corporate headquarters leases in 2024 to, among other terms, extend the lease termination dates from December 2028 to June 2044. Our lease for the Jeffrey Leiden Center commenced in 2021 pursuant to an initial 15-year lease term for this building. We also have several embedded leases with contract manufacturing organizations related to the manufacturing and commercialization of our products with remaining lease terms up to 8 years as of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our largest finance lease relates to the lease for our research site in San Diego, California, which commenced in 2019 pursuant to an initial 16-year lease term.\nOur total future minimum lease payments for our leases for each of the next five years and in total are included in Note L, “Leases.” The total future undiscounted minimum lease payments were $2.7 billion and $189.0 million related to our operating and finance leases, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. To support future product development and commercialization efforts, we may enter into additional lease agreements, which require additional capital.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. \n84\nChanges in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.\nWe believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:\n•\nrevenue recognition;\n•\nacquisitions, including intangible assets, goodwill and contingent consideration;\n•\ninventories; and\n•\nincome taxes.\nOur accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in Note A, “Nature of Business and Accounting Policies.”\nRevenue Recognition\nProduct Revenues, Net\nWe generate product revenues from sales in the U.S. and in international markets. We sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors in the U.S., which account for the largest portion of our total revenues. Our customers in the U.S. subsequently resell our products to patients, health care providers, or authorized treatment centers (“ATCs”) for CASGEVY. We contract with government agencies so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. We make international sales primarily through distributor arrangements and to retail pharmacies, as well as to hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported customers. In certain markets, we may not utilize a specialty distributor or specialty pharmacy to distribute CASGEVY. In these markets, we sell CASGEVY directly to ATCs. We recognize net product revenues from sales of our products when our customers obtain control of our products, which typically occurs upon delivery to customers for our small molecule products, including CF, and upon infusion of our gene-therapy products, including CASGEVY. Revenues from our product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price, which requires us to make several significant estimates regarding the net sales price. \nThe most significant estimate we are required to make for our product revenues is related to government, commercial, and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, collectively rebates. The values of the rebates provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. To estimate our total rebates, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. We track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. We adjust our estimated rebates based upon new information as it becomes available, including information regarding actual rebates for our products. Claims by third-party payors for rebates are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known.\n85\nThe following table summarizes activity related to our product revenue accruals for rebates for 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n(in millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n838.6 \nProvision related to 2022 sales\n2,977.2 \nAdjustments related to prior year(s) sales\n(10.4)\nCredits/payments made\n(2,514.0)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n1,291.4 \nProvision related to 2023 sales\n3,481.4 \nAdjustments related to prior year(s) sales\n(6.5)\nCredits/payments made\n(3,064.7)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n1,701.6 \nProvision related to 2024 sales\n3,673.0 \nAdjustments related to prior year(s) sales\n(42.1)\nCredits/payments made\n(3,725.4)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n1,607.1 \nWe have also entered into annual contracts with government-owned and supported customers in international markets that limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive for our products. Upon exceeding the annual reimbursement amount provided by the customer’s contract with us, products are provided free of charge, which is a material right. If we estimate that the annual reimbursement amount under a contract will be exceeded for an annual period, we defer a portion of the consideration received, which includes upfront payments and fees, for shipments made up to the annual reimbursement limit as “Other current liabilities.” Once the annual reimbursement limit has been reached, we recognize the deferred amount as revenue when we deliver the free products. To estimate the portion of the consideration received to be recognized as revenue and the portion of the amount to be deferred, we rely on our forecast of the number of units we will distribute during the applicable annual period in each international market in which our contracts with government-owned and supported customers limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. Our forecasts are based on, among other things, our historical experience.\nThe preceding estimates and judgments materially affect our recognition of net product revenues. Changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material effect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.\nAcquisitions \nAs part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire products, product candidates and other technologies and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. \nWe are required to make several significant judgments and estimates to determine the accounting treatment for each acquisition transaction. If we determine that substantially all the fair value associated with an acquisition is concentrated in a single asset, or the acquisition does not constitute a business, we account for it as an asset acquisition. For example, we accounted for our $5.0 billion acquisition of Alpine in 2024 as an asset acquisition because povetacicept, Alpine’s lead molecule, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets that we acquired. As a result, $4.4 billion of the fair value attributed to povetacicept was expensed to AIPR&D in 2024. If the fair value that we acquired in an acquisition is distributed among more than one asset, and the acquisition constitutes a business, we account for it as a business combination.\nFor an asset acquisition involving rights to intellectual property related to in-process research and development that is not yet associated with a product that has achieved regulatory approval, we generally expense our upfront payment to AIPR&D, because there is no alternative future use for the asset that was acquired.\n86\nFor business combinations, we are required to make several significant judgments and estimates to calculate and allocate the purchase price to the assets that we have acquired and the liabilities that we have assumed on our consolidated balance sheet. The most significant judgments and estimates relate to the fair value of the in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities related to these business combinations. Based on these judgments and estimates, the fair value of the goodwill that we record as a result of these business combinations may be material.\nIn-process Research and Development Intangible Assets\nAs of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $603.6 million of in-process research and development assets on our consolidated balance sheet within “Other intangible assets, net,” which primarily relate to our T1D clinical program established through our acquisitions of Semma and ViaCyte.\nWe characterize in-process research and development assets on our consolidated balance sheets as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. We test our in-process research and development intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. When we determine that an indefinite-lived intangible asset has become impaired or we abandon the associated research and development project, we write down the carrying value to its fair value and record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs. For example, we recorded a $13.0 million impairment of an in-process research and development intangible asset to “Research and development expenses” in 2022 due to a decision to revise the scope of certain acquired gene-editing programs. If one of our product candidates achieves regulatory approval, the in-process research and development intangible assets associated with the product candidate become finite-lived intangible assets as described below.\nWe use significant judgment to determine the fair value of our in-process research and development assets and have utilized either the multi-period excess earnings or the relief from royalty methods of the income approach. Each method requires us to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success, revenue projections and growth rates, and appropriate discount and tax rates. The multi-period excess earnings method also requires us to estimate development and commercial costs. The relief from royalty method also requires us to estimate the after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the asset that we acquired.\nContingent Consideration\nWe may owe Exonics former equity holders up to $678.3 million upon the achievement of certain events associated with research programs focused on DMD and other severe neuromuscular diseases, including DM1. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $76.9 million and $77.4 million, respectively, of liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets attributable to the fair value of these contingent development and regulatory payments.\nWe record an increase or a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and in our consolidated statement of income on a quarterly basis. We determine the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method of the income approach, which requires us to make estimates of the timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievement and the corresponding estimated probability of technical and regulatory success rates. We use significant judgment in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions during each reporting period. Reasonable changes in these assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. Due to the early stage of Exonics’ programs, these significant assumptions could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nIn November 2023, we determined that additional pre-clinical studies of the delivery system for our gene-editing components for DMD will be required. As a result, we revised our estimates regarding the timing of the development and regulatory milestones and the probability of achieving those milestones, which reduced the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration as of December 31, 2023.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had goodwill of $1.1 billion on our consolidated balance sheets. During 2024, we did not have any business development transactions accounted for as a business combination. Goodwill reflects the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. Thus, the goodwill that we record is dependent on the significant judgments and estimates inherent in these fair values. We have one reporting unit for goodwill reporting purposes. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, and more \n87\nfrequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We have not identified any goodwill impairment to date.\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $222.3 million and $236.3 million, respectively, of finite-lived intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet within “Other intangible assets, net.” These finite-lived intangible assets primarily relate to $208.0 million of CASGEVY regulatory approval milestones recorded in 2023. \nWe amortize our finite-lived intangible assets related to our marketed products, which represent the majority of our finite-lived intangible assets, using the straight-line method within “Cost of sales” over the remaining estimated life of the assets beginning in the period in which regulatory approval is achieved or the assets are acquired and continuing through the period that we no longer have either exclusive rights to market the products associated with the assets or in-license rights to the intellectual property underlying the assets. We test finite-lived intangible assets for impairment if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If we determine that the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. When we determine that a finite-lived intangible asset has become impaired, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs.\nInventories\nWe capitalize inventories prior to regulatory approval when we consider the related product candidate to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and expect to recover the related costs. In making this determination, we evaluate, among other factors, the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities, information regarding the product candidate’s safety and efficacy, and the outlook for commercial sales, including the existence of any competition. During the first quarter of 2024, following positive results related to our Phase 3 trials for JOURNAVX, we began capitalizing inventories produced in preparation for our planned product launch. In January 2025, we received approval from the FDA to market JOURNAVX in the U.S. Prior to making this determination, we expensed inventoriable and related costs associated with JOURNAVX, as well as ALYFTREK, as “Research and development expenses.”\nIncome Taxes \nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. If our estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is (i) not reflective of actual outcomes, (ii) modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, or (iii) revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal, our results of operations could be materially impacted. \nWe provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. On a periodic basis, we reassess our valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. Significant judgment is required in making these assessments to maintain or adjust our valuation allowances and, to the extent our future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at that time. As of December 31, 2024, we maintained a valuation allowance of $272.9 million related primarily to U.S. state tax attributes.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adjust our liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the uncertain positions. We are subject to tax laws and audits in multiple jurisdictions and significant judgment is required in making this assessment. Consequently, we regularly re-evaluate uncertain tax positions and consider various factors, including changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. As of December 31, 2024, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $706.2 million.\n88\n RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note A, “Nature of Business and Accounting Policies,” in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2024.",
