  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS \nLamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Lamb Weston”) is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products and is headquartered in Eagle, Idaho. We are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America and a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong presence in high-growth emerging markets. We offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent most of our value-added frozen potato product portfolio.\nWe were organized as a Delaware corporation in July 2016. Our common stock trades under the ticker symbol “LW” on the New York Stock Exchange.\n1\nTable of Contents\nSegments\nWe have two reportable segments: North America and International. For segment financial information, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 13, Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nNorth America\nOur North America segment primarily includes frozen potato products sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico to quick service and full-service restaurants and chains, foodservice distributors, non-commercial channels, and retailers. Our North America segment’s product portfolio includes frozen potatoes, commercial ingredients, and appetizers sold under the \nLamb Weston\n brand, as well as frozen potatoes sold under the Company’s owned or licensed brands, including \nGrown in Idaho\n and \nAlexia\n, other licensed equities comprised of brand names of major North American restaurant chains, customer labels, and retailers’ own brands.\nInternational\nOur International segment primarily includes frozen potato products sold outside of North America to quick service and full-service restaurant chains, foodservice distributors, non-commercial channels, and retailers. Our International segment’s product portfolio includes frozen potatoes, commercial ingredients, and appetizers sold under the \nLamb Weston\n brand, as well as many customer labels.\nJoint Venture Relationships\nWe hold a 50% ownership interest in Lamb-Weston/RDO Frozen (“Lamb Weston RDO”), a joint venture with RDO Frozen Co., that operates a single potato processing facility in the U.S. We provide all sales and marketing services to Lamb Weston RDO and receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture. We account for our investment in Lamb Weston RDO under the equity method of accounting. In addition, LW EMEA owns a 75% interest in a joint venture in Austria. This joint venture’s financial results are consolidated in our financial statements.\nFor more information, see Note 6, Other Assets, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nSales, Distribution and Customers\nWe benefit from strong relationships with a diverse set of customers. We sell our products through a network of internal sales personnel and independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain restaurants, wholesale, grocery, mass merchants, club retailers, specialty retailers, and foodservice distributors and institutions, including businesses, educational institutions, independent restaurants, regional chain restaurants, and convenience stores. We have long-tenured relationships with leading quick service and fast casual restaurant chains, global foodservice distributors, large grocery retailers, and mass merchants.\nProducts are generally shipped from warehouse distribution centers where they are consolidated for shipment to customers if an order includes products manufactured in more than one production facility or product category. Some customers also pick up their orders at distribution centers.\nA relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. In fiscal 2025, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of our net sales. In fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, our largest customer, McDonald’s Corporation, accounted for approximately 15%, 14%, and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023.\nResearch and Development\nWe leverage our research and development resources for both growth and efficiency initiatives. We seek to drive growth through innovation by creating new products, enhancing the quality of existing products, and participating in joint menu planning exercises with our customers. We also evaluate the sustainability impacts of our manufacturing processes and products in our research and development activities and continue to drive processing innovations aimed at reducing waste and water usage and improving food safety and quality.\n2\nTable of Contents\nTrademarks, Licenses and Patents\nOur trademarks are material to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the U.S. and most other geographic markets where the related food items are sold. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registrations are maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Our significant trademarks include \nLamb Weston, Lamb Weston Supreme, Lamb Weston Seeing Possibilities in Potatoes\n (and design), \nPossibilities in Potatoes\n (and design), \nLamb Weston Seasoned, Lamb Weston Private Reserve, Lamb Weston Stealth Fries, Lamb Weston Colossal Crisp, Lamb Weston Crispy on Delivery, Twister Fries\n, and \nCrissCut\n. We also sell certain products in connection with marks such as \nGrown in Idaho\n and \nAlexia\n, which we license from third parties.\nWe own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions, including packaging, manufacturing processes, equipment, formulations, and designs. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant, the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained, and, in most countries, the payment of fees to maintain the patents. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country, which may, in some countries, depend in part on appropriate patent marking and working the patents. \nRaw Materials\nOur primary raw materials are potatoes, edible oils, packaging, grains, starches, and energy inputs. We source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic, long-term grower relationships and short-term annual contracts. In the U.S., most of the potato crop used in our products is grown in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. In Europe, growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. We also have grower relationships in potato growing regions in Canada, China, Australia, and Argentina that support our processing facilities in those countries. We believe that the grower networks to which we have access provide a sufficient source of raw potato inputs year-to-year. We source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers, and we source packaging and energy inputs through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types.\nThe prices paid for these raw materials, as well as other raw materials used in making our products, generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, fuel prices, energy costs, labor, freight transportation, logistics, general U.S. and global economic conditions, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. The prices of raw materials can fluctuate as a result of these factors. \nDuring fiscal 2025, we continued to face increased costs for the primary raw materials for our products, including potatoes, edible oils, packaging, grains, starches, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through long-term relationships, contracting strategies, and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists, as well as, through our pricing and productivity initiatives. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks related to our input costs.\nManufacturing\nWe operate 26 production facilities for our products. See “Item 2. Properties” for more information about our production facilities. In addition to our own production facilities, we source a portion of our products under “co-packing” agreements, a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies. We regularly evaluate our co-packing arrangements to ensure the most cost-effective manufacturing of our products and to utilize company-owned production facilities most effectively.\nInternational Operations \nAt May 25, 2025, we had operations in 32 countries, with sales support in each of these countries and production and processing facilities in eight countries. See Note 13, Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Also see “Item 2. Properties,” for more information on our production and other facilities. For a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the U.S., see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. \n3\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nThe value-added frozen potato products industry in North America, Europe and other international markets is highly competitive. Competitors include large North American and European frozen potato product companies that compete globally, as well as local and regional companies. The international markets are highly fragmented with increased production capacity recently being added by local companies in emerging markets like Saudi Arabia and India. Significant competitors include Agristo NV, Aviko B.V., Cavendish Farms Corporation, Clarebout Potatoes NV, Farm Frites International B.V., J.R. Simplot Company, The Kraft Heinz Company, and McCain Foods Limited. Some of our competitors are larger and have substantially more financial, sales and marketing, and other resources than us. In addition, some local competitors are vertically integrated, which enables them to produce potato products at lower costs. We compete with producers of similar products on the basis of, among other things, customer service and support, value, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, price, and the ability to identify and satisfy customer and consumer preferences. The markets in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Industry Risks – Increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with competition in our industry.\nSeasonality\nOur inventory levels, net sales, segment adjusted EBITDA, and cash flows are affected by seasonality. In general, our segment adjusted EBITDA percentage tends to be highest in our fiscal third quarter, reflecting the cost benefits of freshly harvested potatoes. We typically harvest potatoes in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. and Europe in July through October, which is primarily in our fiscal second quarter. While the quality of potatoes affects production efficiency, overall, freshly harvested potatoes process more efficiently in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs. We typically hold 50 to 60 days of finished goods inventory on a first-in-first-out basis, so the costs incurred from our fiscal second quarter harvest, which are generally favorable, will flow through our income statement in our fiscal third quarter. Inventory levels also tend to be higher in our fiscal third quarter, requiring more working capital at that time. In general, net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns.\nThe number of days of inventory on hand exceeded our typical levels the last two fiscal years primarily due to lower sales volume compared to forecasted amounts. We have working capital initiatives underway to decrease inventories in line with historical levels.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe that our employees and our workplace culture are among our most important assets, and that our employees are integral to our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. Attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent globally with the right skills to drive our mission, vision, and values are central components of our strategies for long-term growth. As of July 17, 2025, we had approximately 10,100 employees, of which approximately 3,100 employees work outside of the U.S. As of July 17, 2025, approximately 30% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements with terms that we believe are typical for the industry in which we operate. Most of the union workers at our facilities are represented under contracts that expire at various times over the next several years. Of the hourly employees who are represented by these contracts, 65% are party to a collective bargaining agreement currently in negotiations or scheduled to expire over the course of the next twelve months. As the agreements expire, we believe they will be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to the parties.\nHealth and Safety\nOur employees’ health, safety, and well-being are our highest priority. We strive for world-class safety at each of our facilities. This means we continuously focus on creating a zero-incident culture. To help achieve this goal, we foster safety leadership throughout the organization as part of our comprehensive environment, health, safety, and sustainability management system. Through ongoing communications, routine assessments of our safety programs, safety and job-related training, daily risk assessments at facilities, defined standards, and safety measures, we strive to improve our safety performance each year. \n4\nTable of Contents\nTotal Rewards \nOur compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our employees. We are committed to equal pay for equal work. As part of this commitment, we regularly review our compensation practices and benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors such as an employee’s role and experience, job location, and performance. In addition to base salaries, many employees also participate in an annual short-term incentive program and may also receive long-term equity awards. Benefits for U.S. employees include an employee savings 401(k) plan and company matching contributions, health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, wellness incentives, annual on-site health screenings, paid time-off, family leave, parental leave, employee assistance programs, and tuition reimbursement opportunities. Benefits for employees outside of the U.S. vary by country but are generally market competitive and representative of prevalent local company sponsored benefit programs. Eligibility for, and the level of, compensation and benefits vary depending on an employee’s full-time or part-time status, work location, job and career level, and tenure with the Company. We regularly review our compensation and benefit programs with the aim of keeping them competitive and designed to meet our employees’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is important to attract and retain the best available talent.\nRecruitment, Training, and Development\nWe believe maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our ongoing success and is a key aspect of succession planning efforts across the organization. We use recruitment vehicles, including partnerships with universities and communities, local and national organizations, and various social media outlets, to attract strong talent to our organization. Our leadership and people teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by regularly reviewing strategic positions and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those roles, evaluating job skill sets to identify competency gaps, and creating developmental plans to facilitate employee professional growth. We invest in our employees through training and development programs, including both custom internal training and external learning resources, utilizing both live and virtual learning experiences, on the job experiences, rotational assignments, annual and mid-year manager reviews and coaching. These offerings are designed to position employees to execute with excellence in their current roles, accelerate their learning curves, and grow their careers by taking advantage of continuing learning opportunities. For example, in our production facilities, we provide multiple training sessions focused on quality and safety. We also hold courses focused on leadership development for employees and people leaders across our global organization. In addition, with both in-person and our e-learning resources, employees can also focus on timely and topical development areas, including leadership capabilities, management excellence, functional skill building, and inclusion. \nCulture and Employee Engagement\nWe believe that having a workplace culture that supports and values all employees is critical to our success. We believe a workforce with varied perspectives enhances decision-making and drives innovation. We seek to provide a work environment that fosters respect, inclusion, fairness, and dignity, and is free of harassment, discrimination, or fear of retaliation.\nTo understand employee sentiments, we conduct a comprehensive survey every other year of our global workforce, as well as periodic short pulse surveys in between the comprehensive surveys. This survey was completed in fiscal 2025 and was administered and analyzed by an independent third-party provider. The survey results were then reviewed by our executive leadership team and our Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board”). Department leaders were also given the engagement survey results and tasked with taking action based on their employees’ anonymous feedback (both quantitative and qualitative). By considering the results of the survey and implementing actions based on our findings, both at an aggregate enterprise level as well as at department, business, and work group levels, we believe that we have been able to enhance our workplace culture and improve overall employee engagement levels.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWe are also committed to creating and building a culture of giving. We encourage and enable our employees to support many charitable causes. This includes engaging in volunteer programs promoted by the Company or employees. Our locations also manage their own community outreach programs through local giving committees, which provide opportunities for employees to financially engage with local nonprofits and volunteer their time. Annually, we make cash grants through the Lamb Weston Foundation, including through our Pay it Forward program, which gives our employees a role in directing some of the Foundation’s funds. In addition, we offer a matching gifts program to employees and directors, paid volunteer time off, non-profit board service grants, and an employee dependent scholarship program. Further, we have implemented a volunteer reward program that allows employees to provide monetary donations to organizations where they volunteer and established the Team Member Relief Fund to provide financial support to employees experiencing hardships such as catastrophic events, illness, domestic violence, and other unforeseen circumstances.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following are our executive officers as of July 17, 2025: \nName\nTitle\nAge\nMichael J.

Rivershore Lane, Eagle, Idaho 83616. \nThe information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.\n7\nTable of Contents\nFood Safety and Labeling\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, including, among other things, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). This comprehensive and evolving regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, labeling, packaging, and safety of food, including compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. In addition, the Nutrition Label Reform Act of 2016 and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA prescribe the format and content in which specific nutrition information is required to appear on the labels of food products. We are also subject to regulation by certain other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nIn addition, our operations and products are subject to state and local regulation, including the registration and licensing of production facilities, enforcement by state health agencies of various state standards, and the registration and inspection of facilities. Compliance with federal, state, and local regulation is costly and time-consuming. Enforcement actions for violations of federal, state, and local regulations may include seizure and condemnation of products, cease and desist orders, injunctions, voluntary or mandatory recalls or market withdrawals of products, and monetary penalties. We believe that our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety Regulations\nWe are subject to a number of foreign, domestic, federal, state, and local laws and other regulations relating to the protection of human health, the environment and the safety and health of personnel. These requirements apply to a broad range of our activities, including: the regulation and discharge of pollutants into the air, land and water; the identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, spill prevention and reporting of, and emergency response in connection with, hazardous materials and chemical substances; noise and odor emissions from our facilities; and safety and health standards, practices, and procedures that apply to the workplace and the operation of our facilities. \nIn order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts of money and other resources from time to time to: (i) construct or acquire new equipment, (ii) acquire or amend permits to authorize facility operations, (iii) modify, upgrade, or replace existing and proposed equipment, and (iv) clean up or decommission our facilities or other locations in accordance with regulatory requirements. Our capital and operating budgets include planned costs and expenses associated with complying with these laws and other requirements. \nWe expect to spend approximately $100 million in fiscal 2026 to comply with environmental regulations, including those related to discharges into the air, land, and water. These projects largely focus on wastewater treatment at our production facilities. Further, we expect to spend about $500 million in the aggregate over the next six years to comply with government environmental regulations and permit limitations. It is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions, estimates and project completion dates may change, and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects, varying costs or changes in environmental laws and regulations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks—If we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations applicable to our business, we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties” of this Form 10-K.\nAvailable Information\nWe make available, free of charge on our website at www.lambweston.com, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition, which we refer to in this filing as “MD&A,” should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto. Discussions of fiscal 2023 items and fiscal year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024, which we filed with the SEC on July 24, 2024. Results for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.\nOur MD&A is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We have also presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative expenses (“SG&A”), and Adjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement the financial information included in this report. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted SG&A, and Adjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings, and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income, gross profit, SG&A, and equity method investment earnings, as applicable. For more information, refer to the “Results of Operations” and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” sections below.\nOverview\nLamb Weston is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products. We are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America and are a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong and growing presence in high-growth emerging markets. We offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent most of our value-added frozen potato product portfolio. \nDuring fiscal 2025, we operated our business in two reportable segments: North America and International. We report net sales and adjusted EBITDA by segment and on a consolidated basis. Net sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. For additional information on our reportable segments, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below and Note 13, Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.\nExecutive Summary \nWe ended the year with improved trends in customer wins and retention, leading to volume growth for the full year. Inflationary pressure persisted in fiscal 2025, which contributed to consumer uncertainty and lower overall restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand. To compete in this highly competitive environment, we supported our customers with price and trade investments. Halfway through the year, we made important changes to adapt to the evolving environment and put our business on a path back to growth. We announced our FY25 Restructuring Plan, which included the permanent closure of one of our manufacturing facilities, temporarily curtailing certain production lines across our manufacturing network in North America, and other operating and capital expense reductions. We continue to make important changes to adapt to the evolving environment. On July 23, 2025, we outlined “Focus to Win,” a new strategic plan to focus on four pillars including (1) prioritizing markets and channels, (2) strengthening customer partnerships, (3) achieving executional excellence and (4) setting the pace for industry-leading innovation. This strategic plan includes our Cost Savings Program which is expected to deliver at least $250 million of annualized run rate savings by the end of fiscal year 2028. Approximately $200 million of these annualized cost savings are expected by the end of fiscal year 2027. In addition, we expect to generate approximately $120 million of working capital improvements, compared to current levels, by the end of fiscal 2027. In connection with the Cost Savings Program, we expect to recognize total pre-tax cash charges of $70 million to $100 million, most of which will be paid in fiscal 2026.\nA detailed review of our fiscal 2025 performance compared to fiscal 2024 is included in the “Results of Operations” and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” sections below. For more information related to the FY25 Restructuring Plan, see Note 4, Restructuring, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements” of this Form 10-K.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOutlook \nIn fiscal 2026, we expect continued pressure on consumers from macroeconomic and geopolitical factors and that global restaurant traffic will remain approximately even with fiscal 2025 levels. We believe customers and consumers will continue to prioritize french fries as a menu and at home item and that our customer win momentum that began in the second half of fiscal 2025 and the contribution of a 53rd week in fiscal 2026, with the additional week falling in the fourth quarter, will increase sales volumes, despite continued soft restaurant traffic. We expect earnings will decline as they are pressured by carryover price investments and new investments in fiscal 2026, overall input cost increases, net of the benefit of lower raw potato costs, incremental depreciation from the capacity expansions in the Netherlands and Argentina, and increased compensation and benefits as we normalize incentives, which will only be partially offset by benefits from the FY25 Restructuring Plan and Cost Savings Program. Our outlook does not include additional impacts of evolving trade policies, including additional changes in tariffs and retaliatory countermeasures.\nOn July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”). Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, \nIncome Taxes\n, requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. We expect the OBBBA to primarily provide cash tax timing benefits with no material impact to the effective tax rate. We are evaluating the OBBBA impact and will provide further information related to the estimated effect on our fiscal 2026 financials in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ending August 24, 2025.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended May 25, 2025 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 26, 2024\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2025\n2024\n%\nIncrease (Decrease)\nSegment net sales\nNorth America\n$\n4,265.2 \n$\n4,363.2 \n(2)%\nInternational\n2,186.1 \n2,104.4 \n4%\n$\n6,451.3 \n$\n6,467.6 \n—%\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nNorth America\n$\n1,101.4 \n$\n1,263.1 \n(13)%\nInternational\n$\n253.7 \n$\n331.9 \n(24)%\nNet Sales\nLamb Weston’s net sales declined $16.3 million to $6,451.3 million in fiscal 2025. Price/mix declined 2%, reflecting the impact of planned investments in price and trade support in a competitive environment to attract and retain customers globally. The decrease in price/mix was mostly offset by a 2% increase in volume, primarily in the International segment and included fully replacing the combined regional, small, and retail customer volume lost, primarily in North America, in the prior year during the Company’s transition to a new ERP system in the second half of fiscal 2024. Volume increased despite a decrease in global restaurant traffic in fiscal 2025, compared to fiscal 2024.\nNorth America segment net sales declined $98.0 million, or 2%, to $4,265.2 million. Price/mix declined 3%, reflecting planned investments in price and trade driven by an increasingly competitive market, with moderate offsets in channel and product mix. Despite a low single-digit percentage point decline related to softer North America restaurant traffic in fiscal 2025, compared with fiscal 2024, volume increased 1%. Increased regional, small, and retail customer volume more than offset low single-digit volume declines with large chain customers, in North America, which were primarily in the first half of the year. \nInternational segment net sales increased $81.7 million, or 4%, to $2,186.1 million. Volume increased 5%, which reflects growth related to new customer wins and growth with existing customers in all regions. Price/mix declined 1%, which reflects pricing actions in key international markets in response to the continued competitive environment. \n28\nTable of Contents\nGross Profit\nGross profit declined $368.1 million versus the prior fiscal year to $1,398.6 million. Adjusted Gross Profit declined $298.2 million versus the prior fiscal year to $1,460.5 million, driven primarily by increased manufacturing costs per pound, including higher factory burden absorption. In response to softer restaurant traffic and to reduce inventory levels, we temporarily curtailed production in fiscal 2025. In addition, key input costs increased low-single-digits, including: potato, labor, and packaging costs, as well as $57.6 million of incremental depreciation expense largely associated with the Company’s recent capacity expansions in China, the U.S. and the Netherlands. Transportation and warehousing costs increased in the low double-digits, primarily related to higher warehouse inventories. The increased costs were partially offset by lapping an estimated $88 million of pre-tax losses associated with the ERP transition in fiscal 2024; $85.1 million pre-tax charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes; and an estimated $9 million incremental pre-tax loss related to the voluntary product withdrawal initiated in the fourth quarter of the prior year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A declined $67.9 million versus the prior fiscal year to $633.5 million. Adjusted SG&A declined $30.3 million to $643.9 million, primarily related to lapping higher expenses associated with the ERP transition in the prior year, a $13.9 million decrease in advertising and promotion expenses, and the benefit of cost savings associated with the FY25 Restructuring Plan, partially offset by $14.6 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to our ERP transition in the prior year and higher compensation and benefit expenses.\nRestructuring Expense\nRestructuring expense was $100.0 million, which was related to the FY25 Restructuring Plan. For more information, see Note 4, Restructuring, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.\nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income was $357.2 million, down $368.3 million versus the prior fiscal year, and diluted EPS was $2.50, down $2.48 from the prior fiscal year. \nAdjusted EBITDA declined $196.2 million from the prior fiscal year to $1,220.5 million, reflecting lower Adjusted Gross Profit partially offset by lower Adjusted SG&A. \nNorth America Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined $161.7 million to $1,101.4 million, reflecting investments in price and trade, higher manufacturing costs per pound (which largely reflected higher factory burden absorption related to temporarily curtailed production as part of our effort to reduce inventory to current demand levels), and higher transportation and warehousing costs per pound. These cost increases were partially offset by lapping an approximately $83 million negative impact of the ERP transition in the prior year and lower Adjusted SG&A in fiscal 2025, including a $9.5 million decrease in advertising and promotion expenses.\nInternational Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined $78.2 million to $253.7 million. Higher net sales and lower Adjusted SG&A were offset by an increase in manufacturing costs per pound, including mid-to-high single-digit increases in raw potato costs, primarily in the first half of the year and incremental costs related to the start-up of the new production line in the Netherlands. Higher warehouse inventories also led a mid-to-high single-digit increase in warehousing costs. These costs more than offset lapping a $9.9 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes, approximately $9 million, net of allocated losses related to the voluntary product withdrawal, and an approximately $5 million negative impact related to the ERP transition in the prior year.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net in fiscal 2025 increased $44.2 million, or 33%, to $180.0 million. The increase in interest expense, net was driven by a decline of $23.6 million of capitalized interest in fiscal 2025, compared to the prior fiscal year, and higher borrowings during the year. The increase in our total debt reflected increased borrowing under a new term loan agreement. For more information, see Note 8, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 was 28.6%, versus 24.1% in fiscal 2024, with the increase largely attributable to foreign losses without tax benefits and a higher proportion of overall earnings in our International segment. Our effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of U.S. state taxes, foreign taxes, permanent differences, and discrete items.\nFor further information on income taxes, see Note 3, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nEquity method investment earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures were $15.2 million and $26.0 million for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The results for the current and prior fiscal years reflect earnings associated with the Company's 50 percent interest in Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen, an unconsolidated potato processing joint venture in Minnesota.\nAdjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings was slightly down at $25.7 million compared to $26.0 million the prior fiscal year. The prior fiscal year included a $10.8 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. The decrease in equity method investment earnings reflects lower net sales and higher manufacturing costs per pound, primarily related to softer restaurant traffic contributing to lower production and increased factory burden absorption.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary source of our liquidity is from cash flow from operations. We generated $868.3 million of cash from operations in fiscal 2025. We use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt service. A substantial portion of our operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nWe ended fiscal 2025 with $70.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.2 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. \nCash Flows\nBelow is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities:\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n(in millions, except percentages)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash flows provided by (used for):\nOperating activities\n868.3 \n798.2 \nInvesting activities\n(648.0)\n(984.1)\nFinancing activities\n(225.0)\n(48.0)\n(4.7)\n(233.9)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n4.0 \n0.5 \nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n(0.7)\n(233.4)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n71.4 \n304.8 \nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\n70.7 \n71.4 \n30\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities\nDuring fiscal 2025, cash provided by operating activities increased $70.1 million to $868.3 million, compared to $798.2 million for fiscal 2024. The increase primarily related to $349.1 million of favorable changes in working capital, primarily attributable to reduced inventories and a favorable change in accrued liabilities related to changes in compensation and benefit accruals in the prior year.\n Inventory days on hand at the end of fiscal 2025 declined eight days compared with fiscal 2024. This was partially offset by a\n $279.0 million decrease in net income, adjusted for non-cash income and expenses\n. See “Results of Operations” in this MD&A for more information related to the \ndecrease\n in income from operations.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $648.0 million of cash in fiscal 2025, compared with $984.1 million in fiscal 2024. \nThe \ndecrease\n was \nprimarily attributable to reduced cash expenditures in fiscal 2025 as our strategic capacity expansion projects in China and the U.S. were completed in fiscal 2024 and our capacity expansion in the Netherlands was completed in the first half of fiscal 2025. We expect our capacity expansion project in Argentina will begin production in August 2025.\nWe expect to use approximately $500 million for investing activities in fiscal 2026, primarily related to maintenance and facility modernization, as well as expenditures related to environmental projects largely focused on wastewater treatment at our production facilities. \nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2025, we used $225.0 million of net cash for financing activities. We had net proceeds of $42.8 million from our revolving credit facility and other short-term credit facilities held by subsidiaries and $500 million of proceeds from our amended term loan facility that was used primarily to repay an existing term loan facility and outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We used $294.4 million to repurchase an aggregate of 4,867,449 shares at a weighted-average price of $57.94 per share and withheld 216,317 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. In addition, we paid $206.9 million in cash dividends to common stockholders. \nDuring fiscal 2024, proceeds from short-term borrowings and debt issuances were $756.9 million, of which $164.9 million were short-term and $592.0 million related to upsizing our term loan borrowing capacity in connection with entering into a new term loan credit agreement in May 2024. We repaid $401.1 million of debt and financial obligations, which primarily included repayments towards the Term A-2 loan facility and Euro loan facility in connection with entering into new term loan and revolving credit agreements. We used $225.3 million of cash to repurchase 2,294,654 shares of our common stock at an average price of $91.51 per share, and we withheld 146,259 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the year. In addition, we paid $174.0 million in cash dividends to common stockholders. \nFor more information about our debt, including among other items, our revolving credit agreement, term loan facilities, interest rates, maturity dates, and covenants, see Note 8, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. At May 25, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreements.\nObligations and Commitments\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements, potato supply agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations. The unconditional purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding arrangements entered into in the normal course of business to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. \n31\nTable of Contents\nA summary of our material cash requirements for our known contractual obligations as of May 25, 2025 are as follows:\n(in millions)\nTotal\nPayable within 12 Months\nShort-term borrowings and long-term debt, including current portion (a)\n$\n4,148.2 \n$\n448.6 \nInterest on long-term debt (b)\n876.9 \n184.4 \nLeases (a)\n150.5 \n28.8 \nPurchase obligations and capital commitments (a)\n1,011.0 \n309.0 \nTotal\n$\n6,186.6 \n$\n970.8 \n_____________________________________________________\n(a)\nSee the below Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part II, Item 8.

See Note 8, Debt and Financing Obligations, for more information on debt payments and the timing of expected future payments.\n•\nLeases\n. \nSee Note 9, Leases, \nfor more information on our operating and finance lease obligations and timing of expected future payments. The total obligation amount for leases includes imputed interest.\n•\nPurchase obligations and capital commitments\n. See Note 14, Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees, and Legal Proceedings, for more information on our purchase obligations and the timing of future payments and capital commitments in connection with the expansion and replacement of existing facilities and equipment.\n(b)\nAmounts represent estimated future interest payments assuming our long-term debt is held to maturity and using interest rates in effect as of May 25, 2025. This does not reflect a reduction for future estimated capitalized interest amounts.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of May 25, 2025 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results. These estimates require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the estimates described below as our critical accounting estimates. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of significant accounting policies. We review the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board.\nWe have made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our Consolidated Financial Statements may be affected.\nSales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Sales promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, and volume-based incentives. The estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and redemption rates, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories.\n32\nTable of Contents\nTrade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. The costs of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability. The estimate of trade promotions is inherently difficult due to information limitations as the products move beyond distributors and through the supply chain to operators. Estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs, with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends and include the following: quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities, current and past trade-promotion spending patterns, the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category, and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs.\nThe determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer demand for our products and promotion participation, particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products. Final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event. Because of the complexity of some of these trade promotions, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are different from our estimates. As additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. At May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, we had $88.2 million and $90.0 million, respectively, of accrued trade promotions payable recorded in “Accrued liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.\nInherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and expectations about future outcomes. Management judgments are required for the following items:\n•\nManagement reviews deferred tax assets for realizability. Valuation allowances are established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision. \n•\nWe establish accruals for unrecognized tax benefits when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, we believe that an uncertain tax position does not meet the recognition threshold of ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes\n. These contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, the expiration of the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax return, case law and emerging legislation. While it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution for any particular matter, we believe that the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits at May 25, 2025, reflect the estimated outcome of known tax contingencies as of such date in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes under ASC 740. \n•\nWe recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. We have not recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-U.S. earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. While we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above and made by management are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 3, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. \n33\nTable of Contents\nNew and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a listing of new and recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial information included in this report, we have presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted SG&A, and Adjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in analyzing what management views as our core operating performance for purposes of business decision making. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information because they (i) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses and other items affecting comparability between periods, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our core operating performance across periods, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our financial results. In addition, we believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and the reconciliations to those GAAP financial measures, provides investors with additional tools to understand the factors and trends affecting our underlying business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as alternatives for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP that are also presented in this report. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, gross profit, SG&A, equity method investment earnings, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way we do.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet income (a)\n$\n357.2 \n$\n725.5 \nInterest expense, net\n180.0 \n135.8 \nIncome tax expense\n143.1 \n230.0 \nIncome from operations including equity method investment earnings\n680.3 \n1,091.3 \nDepreciation and amortization (b)\n378.2 \n306.2 \nUnrealized derivative gains\n(23.1)\n(24.9)\nForeign currency exchange losses\n15.2 \n28.6 \nBlue chip swap transaction gains\n(21.1)\n(18.0)\nItems impacting comparability:\nRestructuring Plan and other expenses\n185.8 \n— \nShareholder activism expense\n5.2 \n— \nInventory step-up from acquisition\n— \n20.7 \nIntegration and acquisition-related items, net\n— \n12.8 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,220.5 \n$\n1,416.7 \n_____________________________________________________\n(a)\nNet income included:\ni.\nRestructuring plan expenses of $185.8 million ($143.7 million after-tax, or $1.01 per share) related to the FY25 Restructuring Plan announced on October 1, 2024, for fiscal 2025.

Fiscal year 2024 included an estimated $40 million loss ($30 million after-tax, or $0.20 per share) related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The total charge to the reporting segments was approximately $19 million to the North America segment and approximately $21 million to the International segment.\nix.\nIn fiscal 2024, we estimate that we incurred approximately $95 million of losses ($72 million after-tax) related to the ERP transition in the fiscal third quarter, including approximately $83 million in the North America segment, approximately $5 million in the International segment, and $7 million of unallocated corporate costs.\nx.\nIn fiscal 2024, we recorded a $95.9 million charge ($72.9 million after-tax, or $0.50 per share) related to a write-off of excess raw potatoes.
