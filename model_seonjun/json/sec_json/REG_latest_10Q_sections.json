These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"guidance,\" and other similar language.  However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking.  While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risk factors, including, without limitation, risk factors relating to:\n•\nthe current economic and geopolitical environments\n•\npandemics or other health crises\n•\noperating retail-based shopping centers\n•\nreal estate investments\n•\nthe environment affecting our properties \n•\ncorporate matters\n•\nour partnerships and joint ventures\n•\nfunding strategies and capital structure\n•\ninformation management and technology\n•\ntaxes and the Parent Company’s qualification as a REIT\n•\nthe Company’s stock price.\nAs more specifically described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (\"2024 Form 10-K\") and in Part II, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" in this Report.  When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our most recent 2024 Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our other filings with and submissions to the SEC.  If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.  Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as and to the extent required by law.\n \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") presentations, we use and report certain non-GAAP financial measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results.  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP financial measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.\nWe do not consider non-GAAP financial measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders.  The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects of the Company.\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include the following:\n \n•\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (\"AFFO\") \nis an additional performance measure we use that reflects cash available to fund the Company’s business needs and distribution to shareholders.  AFFO is calculated by adjusting Core Operating Earnings (\"COE\") for (i) capital expenditures necessary to maintain and lease our portfolio of properties, (ii) debt cost and derivative adjustments and (iii) stock-based compensation.\n•\nCore Operating Earnings \nis an additional performance measure we use because the computation of Nareit Funds from Operations (\"\nNareit FFO\n\") includes certain non-comparable items that affect our period-over-period performance.  Core Operating Earnings excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses, (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt, (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from straight-line rents, above and below market rent amortization, and debt and derivative mark-to-market amortization, and (iv) other amounts as they occur.\n•\nNareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\") \nis a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which Nareit defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sales and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships and joint ventures.  We compute Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition.\nCompanies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions.  Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sale and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs.  This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations.\n•\nNet Operating Income (\"NOI\")\n is the sum of base rent, percentage rent, termination fee income, tenant recoveries, other lease income, and other property income, less operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, ground rent, termination expense, and uncollectible lease income.  NOI excludes straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees.  We also provide disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses.\nManagement believes that NOI is a useful measure for investors because it provides insight into the core operations and performance of our properties, independent of the capital structure, financing activities, and non-operating factors. By focusing on property-level performance, NOI allows investors to compare the performance of our real estate assets across periods and with those of other REIT peers in the industry, facilitating a clearer understanding of trends in occupancy, rental income, and operating expense management. In addition to its relevance for investors, management uses NOI as a key performance metric in making operational and strategic decisions. NOI is used to evaluate income generated from shopping centers (i.e., return on assets) and to guide decisions on capital investments. These decisions may include acquisitions, redevelopments, and investments in capital improvements.\n \n•\nPro-rata\n information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our economic share (based on our ownership interest) in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.\nWe provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP.  We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of assets, liabilities, operating results, and other metrics, along with certain other non-GAAP financial measures, makes comparisons of our operating results to those of other REITs more meaningful.  The Pro-rata information provided is not, nor is it intended to be, presented in accordance with GAAP.  The Pro-rata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets, liabilities, and operating results of the properties in our portfolio.\nThe Pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets, liabilities, and operating results of properties in our portfolio.  We do not control the unconsolidated real estate partnerships, and the Pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items.  The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital.  Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our Pro-rata share.\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe presentation of Pro-rata information has limitations which include, but are not limited to, the following:\no\nThe amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and\no\nOther companies in our industry may calculate their Pro-rata interest differently, limiting the comparability of Pro-rata information.\nBecause of these limitations, the Pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP.  We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the Pro-rata information as a supplement.\n•\nPro-rata\n \nSame Property NOI\n is a key non-GAAP financial measure commonly used by REITs to evaluate operating performance. It is calculated on a proportionate ownership basis for properties held during the comparable reporting periods, excluding revenue and expenses related to non-same properties during the periods. \nManagement believes this measure provides investors with a useful and consistent comparison of the Company’s operating performance and trends.  Management uses Pro-rata Same Property NOI as a supplemental measure to assess property-level performance, excluding the effects of corporate-level expenses, financing costs, and non-operating activities. This measure allows investors to evaluate trends in revenue and expense growth for properties that have been consistently operated during the periods.\nOther Defined Terms\nThe following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results, and are included in this document:\n•\nAnchor Space \nis a space equal to or greater than 10,000 SF.\n•\nDevelopment Completion\n is a Property in Development that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations.  Once deemed complete, the property is termed a Retail Operating Property.\n•\nA \nNon-Same Property\n is any property, during either calendar year period being compared, that was acquired, sold, a Property in Development, a Development Completion, or a property under, or being positioned for, significant redevelopment that distorts comparability between periods.  Non-retail properties and corporate activities, including the captive insurance program, are part of Non-Same Property.\n•\nProperty In Development\n includes properties in various stages of ground-up development.\n•\nProperty In Redevelopment \nincludes Retail Operating Properties under redevelopment or being positioned for redevelopment.  Unless otherwise indicated, a Property in Redevelopment is included in the Same Property pool.\n•\nRedevelopment Completion\n is a Property in Redevelopment that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90% of total estimated project costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95% for the Company owned GLA related to the project, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations, if applicable.\n•\nRetail Operating Property\n is any retail property not termed a Property in Development.  A retail property is any property where the majority of the income is generated from retail uses.\n•\nSame Property\n is a Retail Operating Property that was owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared.  This term excludes Properties in Development, prior year Development Completions, and Non-Same Properties.  Properties in Redevelopment are included unless otherwise indicated.  \n•\nShop Space\n is a space under 10,000 SF.\nOverview of Our Strategy\nRegency Centers Corporation began operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993.  All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through our Operating Partnership, Regency Centers, L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through our real estate partnerships.  As of September 30, 2025, the Parent Company owned approximately 97.9% of the outstanding Common Units and 100% of the Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership.\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are a preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of neighborhood and community shopping centers predominantly located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics.  As of September 30, 2025, we had full or partial ownership interests in 485 retail properties.  Our properties are high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers primarily anchored by market leading grocers and principally located in suburban markets within the country's most desirable metro areas, and contain approximately 58.6 million square feet (\"SF\") of gross leasable area (\"GLA\").  \nOur mission is to create thriving environments for retailers and service providers to connect with surrounding neighborhoods and communities.  Our vision is to elevate quality of life as an integral thread in the fabric of our communities.  Our portfolio includes thriving properties merchandised with highly productive grocers, restaurants, service providers, and best-in-class retailers that connect with their neighborhoods, communities, and customers.\n \nOur values:\n•\nWe are our people: Our people are our greatest asset, and we believe that our highly skilled and talented team makes us better.\n•\nWe do what is right: We act with unwavering standards of honesty and integrity.\n•\nWe connect with our communities: We promote philanthropic ideas and strive for the betterment of our neighborhoods by giving our time and financial support.\n•\nWe are responsible: Our duty is to balance purpose and profit, being good stewards of capital and the environment for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n•\nWe strive for excellence: When we are passionate about what we do, it is reflected in our performance.\n•\nWe are better together: When we listen to each other and our customers, we will succeed together.\nOur goals are to:\n•\nOwn and manage a portfolio of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored primarily by market leading grocers and principally located in suburban trade areas in the most desirable metro areas in the United States.  We believe that this strategy will result in highly desirable and attractive centers with best-in-class retailers.  These centers should command higher rental and occupancy rates resulting in excellent prospects to grow NOI;\n•\nCreate shareholder value by increasing earnings and dividends per share that generate total returns at or near the top of our shopping center peers;\n•\nMaintain an industry leading, disciplined development and redevelopment platform to create exceptional retail centers that deliver favorable returns;\n•\nSupport our business activities with a conservative capital structure, including a strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs together with a carefully constructed debt maturity profile; and\n•\nImplement resiliency and governance practices through our Corporate Responsibility program to support and enhance our business goals and objectives.\nExecuting on our Strategy\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we had Net income attributable to common shareholders of $314.7 million as compared to $303.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025:\n•\nOur Pro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees, grew 5.5%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to improvements in base rent from increases in year over year occupancy rates, contractual rent steps in existing leases, and positive rent spreads on comparable new and renewal leases.    \n•\nWe executed 1,418 new and renewal leasing transactions representing 5.3 million Pro-rata SF with positive rent spreads of 10.4% during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 1,503 leasing transactions representing 6.3 million Pro-rata SF with positive rent spreads of 9.0% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  Rent spreads are calculated on all executed leasing transactions for comparable Retail Operating Property spaces, including spaces vacant greater than 12 months.\n•\nAt September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024, and September 30, 2024, our total property portfolio was 96.0%, 96.3%, and 95.6% leased, respectively.  At September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024, and September 30, 2024 our same property portfolio was 96.4%, 96.7%, and 96.0% leased, respectively.\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers:\n•\nEstimated Pro-rata project costs of our current in process development and redevelopment projects totaled $668.1 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $497.3 million at December 31, 2024.\n•\nDevelopment and redevelopment projects completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 represented $48.4 million of estimated net project costs, with an average stabilized yield of 14.3%.  A stabilized yield for development and redevelopment projects represents the incremental NOI (estimated stabilized NOI less NOI prior to project commencement) divided by the total project costs. \nWe maintained liquidity and the financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities:\n•\nIn February 2025, we received a credit rating upgrade to A- with a stable outlook from S&P Global Ratings. \n•\nOn May 13, 2025, the Company issued $400 million of senior unsecured notes due 2032, at a par value of 99.279% and a coupon of 5.0% (the \"2025 Notes\"). \n•\nIn July 2025, in connection with the acquisition of five operating properties, the Operating Partnership issued 2,773,087 Common Units and assumed $150 million of secured mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% and an average remaining term of approximately 12 years.\n•\nThe Company settled forward sales agreements entered into during 2024 under its ATM program as follows:\no\nIn August 2025, the Company issued 673,172 shares of common stock and received $49.2 million of net proceeds.\no\nSubsequent to quarter end, in October 2025, the Company issued an additional 666,205 shares of common stock and received $49.1 million of net proceeds. Upon completion of these settlements, the Company had fully settled all forward sales agreements entered into during 2024.\n•\nSubsequent to quarter end, on October 1, 2025, the Company received a property distribution from its Regency-GRI real estate partnership. The distribution involved 11 of the 66 properties within the partnership and the Company received five of these properties, which had an aggregate fair value of approximately $113 million, and assumed an existing fixed rate mortgage loan on one property of $10 million maturing January 2026 with an interest rate of 3.95%. The remaining six properties were distributed to the other partner.\n•\nWe have $646.3 million of loans maturing during the next 12 months, of which, $250 million was repaid upon maturity on November 3, 2025, and Regency's pro-rata share of maturities within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships which we intend to refinance or pay-off as they mature. \n•\nAt September 30, 2025, we had $1.46 billion available on the Line, which expires on March 23, 2028 unless we exercise the available options to extend the expiration for either or both of two additional consecutive six-month periods, in which case the term will be extended in accordance with any such option exercise.\nEconomic Conditions\nRefer to the Estimated Risks and Uncertainties section in Note 1 — Organization and Significant Accounting Policies, as these risks and uncertainties could have a material impact on future results of operations and trends.\n \nProperty Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes general

rent PSF on signed Shop Space leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 is $41.39 PSF, which is higher than the weighted average annual base rent PSF of all Shop Space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of $36.91 PSF.  New and renewal rent spreads, compared to prior rents on these same spaces leased, were positive at 10.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 9.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDiversification and Concentration of Tenant Risk\nWe seek to reduce our risk by limiting dependence on any single tenant.

We seek to mitigate potentially adverse impacts through maintaining a high quality portfolio, diversifying our geographic and tenant mix, replacing less successful tenants with stronger operators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive customer traffic, and investing in suburban trade areas with compelling demographic populations benefiting from high levels of disposal income.\n \nWe recognize that current economic conditions including, but not limited to, the potential impacts of tariffs and trade deals, inflation, cost and availability of labor, including potential labor shortages related to deportations or threat of deportations, increasing energy prices and interest rates, supply chain disruptions, access to and cost of credit, and new tax and regulatory changes  have introduced additional macroeconomic uncertainty. These economic conditions could place further financial strain on retailers by raising costs and compressing margins. The potential for a recession and the severity and duration of any economic downturn could negatively impact our existing tenants and their ability to continue to meet their lease obligations.\nAlthough base rent is derived from long-term lease contracts, tenants that file for bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.  As a result, in a tenant bankruptcy situation it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  Additionally, we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and significant downtime to re-lease the vacated space.  In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues.  At September 30, 2025, the tenants who are currently in bankruptcy and which continue to occupy space in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 0.2% of our Pro-rata annual base rent.\n \nResults of Operations\nComparison of the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nChanges in revenues are summarized in the following table:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree months ended September 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase rent\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n265,289\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n246,531\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18,758\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecoveries from tenants\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n92,406\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n84,795\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,611\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage rent\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,950\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,155\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(205\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncollectible lease income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(342\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n395\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther lease income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,536\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n507\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight-line rent\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,743\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,163\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,580\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove/below market rent amortization, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,784\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,726\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal lease income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n377,761\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n349,057\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28,704\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther property income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,089\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,444\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,355\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement, transaction, and other fees\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,720\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,765\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(45\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n387,570\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n360,266\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27,304\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal lease income increased by $28.7 million primarily due to the following:\n•\n$18.8 million increase from billable Base rent, mainly from the following:\no\n$12.2 million net increase from same properties, including:\n▪\n$6.8 million net increase due to increases from occupancy, contractual rent steps in existing leases, and positive rental spreads on new and renewal leases;\n▪\n$4.3 million increase due to redevelopment projects becoming operational; and \n▪\n$1.1 million increase related to our acquisitions of the remaining ownership interests in and resulting consolidation of operating properties previously held in unconsolidated real estate partnerships;\no\n$5.9 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties in 2025 as compared to 2024 activity; and\no\n$1.2 million increase from rent commencements at completed development properties; partially offset by \no\n$0.5 million decrease due to dispositions of operating properties.\n•\n$7.6 million increase from contractual Recoveries from tenants which represents their proportionate share of the operating, maintenance, insurance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.  We provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP.  We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of operating results, along with other non-GAAP financial measures, may assist in comparing our operating results to other REITs.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP financial measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported non-GAAP financial measures could change.  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the beginning of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n \nWe do not consider non-GAAP financial measures as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders.  The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided, including as set forth below.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro-rata Same Property NOI (Non-GAAP

Regency's Pro-rata share of unconsolidated investment partnerships, net of Pro-rata share attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe use cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our investment activities, and maintain financial flexibility.  A significant portion of our cash flows from operations is distributed to our common shareholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain our status as a REIT.\nExcept for $200 million of private placement debt, our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership.  All remaining debt is held by our Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries, or by our real estate partnerships.  The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor of the $200 million of outstanding debt of our Parent Company.  The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity, and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.\n \nWe continually assess our available liquidity and our expected cash requirements, including monitoring our tenant rent collections.  We have access to and draw on multiple financing sources to fund our operations and our long-term capital needs, including the requirements of our in process and planned developments, redevelopments, other capital expenditures, and the repayment of debt.  We expect to meet these needs by using a combination of the following: cash flows from operations after funding our common stock and preferred stock dividends, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from sale of real estate, mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing, distributions received from our real estate partnerships, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from sale of equity securities or the issuance of new unsecured debt.  We continually evaluate alternative financing options, and we believe we can obtain new financing on reasonable terms, although likely at higher interest rates than that of our debt currently outstanding, due to the current interest rate environment.\n \nWe are actively monitoring market conditions and evaluating strategies to mitigate interest rate risk. These strategies may include the use of interest rate swaps, caps, or forward-starting hedges to lock in rates on future debt issuances or refinancings. We are also prioritizing refinancing of maturing debt with long-duration fixed-rate debt where appropriate, to minimize future exposure to rate volatility.\nOn May 13, 2025, the Company issued $400 million of senior unsecured notes due 2032, at a par value of 99.279% and a coupon of 5.0%. The intended use of the net proceeds includes (i) to reduce the outstanding balance on the Line, (ii) for the repayment of $250 million of 3.90% unsecured public debt due November 1, 2025, upon it's maturity and (iii) for general corporate purposes, which may include the future repayment of other outstanding debt. Pending the maturity of the November 2025 unsecured public debt, we also temporarily invested a portion of the proceeds in commercial time deposits.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $646.3 million of debt maturing within the next 12 months, including $450 million of maturing unsecured public and private placement debt, of which $250 million was paid off at maturity on November 3, 2025, as well as Regency's pro-rata share of maturities within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which we intend to refinance or pay off as they mature. We currently expect to address these maturing obligations through a combination of refinancing,  available liquidity under our Line, and proceeds from potential property sales. We continually monitor capital markets and proactively manage our debt maturity profile to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.\nBased upon our available cash balance, sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs for the next year, although, in the longer term, we can provide no assurances.\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition to our $200.7 million of unrestricted cash, we have the following additional sources of capital available:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\nSeptember 30, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nATM program\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal offering amount\n\n\n$\n\n\n500,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable capacity\n\n\n$\n\n\n400,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine of credit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal commitment amount\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,500,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable capacity \n(1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,457,440\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaturity \n(2)\n\n\nMarch 23, 2028\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nNet of letters of credit issued against our Line.\n(2)\nThe Company has the option to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods.\nThe declaration of dividends is determined quarterly by, and in the discretion of, our Board of Directors.\n \nOn August 5, 2025, the Board:\n \n•\nDeclared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s common stock of $0.705 per share. The dividend was paid on October 2, 2025, to shareholders of record as of September 11, 2025.\n•\nDeclared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s Series A preferred stock of $0.390625 per share. The dividend was paid on October 31, 2025, to shareholders of record  of the Series A preferred stock  as of October 16, 2025.\n•\nDeclared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s Series B preferred stock of $0.367200 per share. The dividend was paid on October 31, 2025, to shareholders of record of the Series B preferred stock as of October 16, 2025.\nSubsequent to the period ended September 30, 2025, on October 27, 2025, our Board of Directors:\n•\nDeclared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.755 per share, representing an increase of $0.05 per share, or 7.1%, from the prior quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable on January 6, 2026, to shareholders of record as of December 15, 2025. \n•\nDeclared a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, which will be paid at a rate of $0.390625 per share on January 30, 2026.  The dividend will be payable to holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock as of the close of business on January 16, 2026.\n•\nDeclared a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock, which will be paid at a rate of $0.367200 per share on January 30, 2026.  The dividend will be payable to holders of record of the Series B Preferred Stock as of the close of business on January 16, 2026. \nWhile future dividends on shares of our common stock will be determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\n \nWe have historically generated sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our dividend distributions.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we generated cash flows from operations of $623.7 million and $598.8 million, respectively, and paid $395.8 million and $381.5 million in dividends to our common stock, preferred stock and unit holders.\n \nWe currently have development and redevelopment projects in various stages of planning, design and construction, along with a pipeline of potential projects for future development or redevelopment.  After funding our common and preferred stock and units dividend payment in October 2025, we estimate that we will require capital during the next 12 months of approximately $1,085.5 million related to leasing commissions, tenant improvements, in-process developments and redevelopments, capital contributions to our real estate partnerships, and repaying maturing debt.  These capital requirements may be impacted by tariffs and inflation, as well as potential shortages of labor employed by contractors,  resulting in increased costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and suppliers.  We continue to implement mitigation strategies including, but not limited to, entering into fixed cost construction contracts, pre-ordering materials, and other planning efforts.  Further, continued challenges from permitting delays and labor and material shortages may extend the time to completion of these projects.\nIf we start new developments or redevelopments, commit to property acquisitions, repay debt prior to maturity, declare future dividends, or repurchase shares of our common stock, our cash requirements will increase.  If we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease.\n \nWe endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets.  As of September 30, 2025, 86.9% of our consolidated real estate assets were unencumbered.  Our low level of encumbered assets allows us to more readily access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain borrowing capacity on the Line.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Line and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various customary financial covenants, which are described in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2024 Form 10-K.  We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2025, and expect to remain in compliance.\n \nSummary of Cash Flow Activity\nThe following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended September 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n623,744\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n598,813\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,931\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n(404,711\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(209,071\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(195,640\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n(75,322\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(366,265\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n290,943\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n\n\n$\n\n\n143,711\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23,477\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n120,234\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n\n\n$\n\n\n205,595\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n114,831\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90,764\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNet cash provided by operating activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $24.9 million due to:\n•\n$27.2 million increase in cash from operations due to the timing of receipts and payments, partially offset by \n•\n$2.3 million decrease in operating cash flow distributions from Investments in real estate partnerships.\nNet cash used in investing activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities changed by $195.6 million as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended September 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flows from investing activities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition of operating real estate, net of cash acquired of $4,273 and $14,143 in 2025 and 2024, respectively\n\n\n$\n\n\n(103,502\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(45,205\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(58,297\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal estate development and capital improvements\n\n\n \n\n\n(307,282\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(235,284\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(71,998\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from sale of real estate\n\n\n \n\n\n51,084\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n103,626\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(52,542\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from property insurance casualty claims\n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,257\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(5,257\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssuance of notes receivable\n\n\n \n\n\n(176\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(32,651\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32,475\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollection of notes receivable\n\n\n \n\n\n479\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,052\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,573\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments in real estate partnerships\n\n\n \n\n\n(12,399\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(25,771\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,372\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn of capital from investments in real estate partnerships\n\n\n \n\n\n12,162\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,859\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(697\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividends on investment securities\n\n\n \n\n\n1,232\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n296\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n936\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase of investment securities\n\n\n \n\n\n(99,770\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(99,035\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(735\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from sale of investment securities\n\n\n \n\n\n53,461\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n103,785\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(50,324\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n$\n\n\n(404,711\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(209,071\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(195,640\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nSignificant changes in investing activities include:\n•\nWe paid $103.5 million in 2025 to purchase nine operating properties and one operating outparcel.

We intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisitions, existing building expansions, facade renovations, new out-parcel building constructions, and redevelopments related tenant improvement costs.  The size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan.  The timing and duration of these projects could also result in volatility in NOI.  See the tables below for more details about our redevelopment projects.\n•\nDevelopment costs are higher in 2025 due to the progress towards completion of our development projects in process.  See the tables below for more details about our development projects.\n•\nInterest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual costs incurred.  We cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor tenant opens for business.  If we reduce our development and redevelopment activity, the amount of interest that we capitalize may be lower than historical averages.\n•\nWe have a dedicated staff of employees who directly support our development program, which includes redevelopment of our existing properties.

The remaining notes payable float with SOFR and had a weighted average variable interest rate of 6.7%, based on rates as of September 30, 2025.  These fixed and variable rate notes payable are all non-recourse, and our Pro-rata share was $574.3 million as of September 30, 2025.  As notes payable mature, they will be repaid from proceeds from new borrowings and/or partner capital contributions.  Refinancing debt at maturity in the current interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense in future periods if rates remain elevated.\nWe are obligated to contribute our Pro-rata share to fund maturities if the loans are not refinanced, and we have the capacity to do so from existing cash balances, availability on our Line, and operating cash flows.  We believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  In the event that a real estate investment partner is unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the real estate partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call which would be secured by the partner's membership interest.\nManagement fee income\nIn addition to earning our share of net income or loss in each of these real estate partnerships, we recognized fees as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree months ended September 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended September 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement, transaction, and other fees\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,640\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,765\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20,471\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,896\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThere have been no material changes in our Critical Accounting Estimates from the information provided in the \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" section of \"Item 7.
