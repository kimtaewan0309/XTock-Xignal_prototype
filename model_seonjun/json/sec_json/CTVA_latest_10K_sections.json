Corteva was incorporated in Delaware in March 2018 and maintains its business headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. With one of the broadest and most productive new product pipelines in the agriculture industry, Corteva is focused on progressing science-based innovations, which aim to deliver a wide range of improved agriculture products and services to its customers. The company leverages its rich heritage of scientific achievement to advance its robust innovation pipeline and continue to shape the future of responsible agriculture. New products are crucial to solving farmers’ productivity challenges amid a growing global population while addressing natural resistance, evolving environmental environments and weather patterns, regulatory changes, safety requirements and competitive dynamics. The company’s investments\n \nseek to generate returns through providing farmers with technology-based and solution-based product offerings to meet these evolving production needs. Meanwhile, through Corteva’s unique routes to market, the company continues to work face-to-face with farmers around the world to understand their needs. \nThe company's broad portfolio of agriculture solutions fuels farmer productivity in approximately 110 countries. See Note 22 - Geographic Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for details on the location of the company's sales and property. \nOn June 1, 2019, Corteva, Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company through the completed separation (the “Separation”) of the agriculture business of DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (formerly known as DowDuPont Inc.) (“DuPont” or \"DowDuPont\").  \nAs a result of the Internal Reorganization (defined below), on May 31, 2019, EIDP was contributed to Corteva, Inc. and, as a result, Corteva, Inc. owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of EIDP. Shares of EIDP preferred stock, $3.50 Series and $4.50 Series, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Separation remain issued and outstanding and were unaffected by the Separation. Prior to March 31, 2019, Corteva, Inc. had engaged in no business operations and had no assets or liabilities of any kind, other than those incident to its formation.\nInternal Reorganizations and Business Separations\nSubsequent to the Merger, Historical Dow and EIDP engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps to realign their businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products (\"Internal Reorganization\"). On April 1, 2019, DowDuPont completed the separation of its materials science business into a separate and independent public company, Dow, Inc. \nOn April 1, 2019, Historical Dow entities, which held certain assets and liabilities aligned with Historical Dow’s agriculture business and the assets and liabilities associated with its specialty products business, respectively, were transferred and conveyed to DowDuPont.\nOn April 1, 2019 and May 1, 2019, EIDP’s materials science and specialty products entities, along with their respective assets and liabilities, were conveyed to Dow and DowDuPont, respectively. On May 2, 2019, DowDuPont conveyed Historical Dow agricultural entities to EIDP. \n 3\nTable Of Contents\nPart I\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS,\n \ncontinued\nOn May 6, 2019, the Board of Directors of DowDuPont approved the distribution of all the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Corteva, Inc., then a wholly-owned subsidiary of DowDuPont, to DowDuPont stockholders. On May 31, 2019, DowDuPont contributed EIDP to Corteva, Inc. and on June 1, 2019, the Separation was completed. Corteva, Inc.'s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"CTVA\" on June 3, 2019.\nSeparation Agreements\nIn connection with their ultimate separation, DuPont, Corteva, and Dow (together, the “Parties” and each a “Party”) have entered into certain agreements to effect the separation, provide for the allocation of DowDuPont’s assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including its investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) among the Parties, and provide a framework for Corteva's relationship with Dow and DuPont following the separations. The Parties entered into the following agreements:\n•\nSeparation and Distribution Agreement - Effective April 1, 2019, the Parties entered into an agreement that sets forth, among other things, governance of certain aspects of the Parties’ ongoing relationships after the completion of their respective separations (the \"Corteva Separation Agreement\").\n•\nTax Matters Agreement - The Parties entered into an agreement effective as of April 1, 2019, as amended on June 1, 2019, that governs their respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and other matters regarding taxes.\n•\nEmployee Matters Agreement - The Parties entered into an agreement effective as of April 1, 2019, that identifies employees and employee-related liabilities (and attributable assets) allocated (either retained, transferred and accepted, or assigned and assumed, as applicable) to the respective Parties.\n•\nIntellectual Property Cross-License Agreement - Effective as of April 1, 2019 Corteva and Dow, and effective June 1, 2019, Corteva and DuPont, entered into Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. The Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements set forth the terms and conditions under which the applicable Parties may use in their respective businesses, certain know-how (including trade secrets), copyrights, and software, and certain patents and standards, allocated to another Party pursuant to the Corteva Separation Agreement.\n•\nLetter Agreement - Effective as of June 1, 2019 DuPont and Corteva entered into a Letter Agreement. The Letter Agreement sets forth certain additional terms and conditions related to the Separation, including certain limitations on each party’s ability to transfer certain businesses and assets to third parties without assigning certain of such party’s indemnification obligations under the Corteva Separation Agreement to the other party to the transferee of such businesses and assets or meeting certain other alternative conditions.\nBusiness Segments\nThe company’s operations are managed through two reportable segments: Seed and Crop Protection. The Seed segment develops and supplies commercial seed combining superior germplasm with advanced traits to produce high yield potential for farmers around the world. The Crop Protection segment supplies products to protect crop yields against weeds, insects and disease, enabling farmers to achieve optimal results. The combination of these leading platforms creates one of the broadest portfolios of agriculture solutions in the industry. Additional information with respect to business segment results is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 39 of this report and Note 23 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n 4\nTable Of Contents\nPart I\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS,\n \ncontinued\nSeed\nThe Seed segment is a global leader in developing and supplying commercial seed combining advanced germplasm and traits that produce optimum yield for farms around the world. The company’s Seed segment is a leader in many key seed markets, including North America corn and soybeans, Europe corn and sunflower, as well as Brazil, India, South Africa and Argentina corn. The company offers trait technologies that improve resistance to weather, disease, insects, herbicides used to control weeds and enhance food and nutritional characteristics, and digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making to help maximize yield and profitability. \nA summary of the Seed segment’s net sales by major product line and geographic region (based on customer location) are as follows:\n \nProducts and Brands \nThe Seed segment’s major brands and technologies, by key product line, are listed below:\nSeed Solutions Brands\nPioneer\n® \nseeds; Brevant\n®\n seeds; Dairyland Seed\n®\n; Hoegemeyer\n® \nhybrids; Nutech\n®\n seed; Seed Consultants\n®\n; AgVenture\n® \nbrand; Cordius®, Licensing Division of Corteva Agriscience, DUO\n®\n hybrid corn, NEXSEM\n®\n corn, Nord\nTM\n semillas; PhytoGen\n®\n cotton; Pannar™\n \nbrand corn\nSeed Solutions Traits and Technologies\nENLIST™ corn; ENLIST E3™ soybeans; ENLIST™ cotton; Enlist™ weed control system;  Herculex® Insect Protection; Herculex® XTRA Insect Protection; Leptra® insect protection technology offering protection against above ground pests; PowerCore® corn, PowerCore® Ultra corn, PowerCore® Enlist™ corn, PowerCore® Ultra Enlist™ corn, POWERCORE® trait technology family of products; Optimum® AcreMax® family of products offering above and below ground insect protection; REFUGE ADVANCED® trait technology; SMARTSTAX® trait technology; NEXERA® canola trait; Omega-9 Oils; Pioneer® brand Optimum® AQUAmax® products; Pioneer® brand A-Series soybeans; Pioneer® brand Plenish® high oleic soybeans; ExpressSun® herbicide tolerant trait; Pioneer Protector® products for canola, sunflower and sorghum; Pioneer MAXIMUS® rapeseed hybrids; Qrome® corn; Clearfield® canola; PROPOUND™ advanced canola meal; Vorceed™ Enlist™ products; Conkesta®; Conkesta E3® soybeans; WideStrike™ Insect Protection; WideStrike™ 3 Insect Protection; Inzen® trait; BOLT® technology; STS® herbicide tolerant trait; MAXIMUS®  canola hybrids; CottonBest ® program; Brevant® Protector products; Optimum® GLY herbicide tolerance trait Optimum® AcreMax® insect protection; Optimum® AcreMax® Leptra® insect protection; Optimum® AcreMax® Xtra insect protection; Optimum® AcreMax® XTreme insect protection; Bovalta® BMR products; Optimum® Intrasect® insect protection; Optimum® Leptra® insect protection\nOther\nLumiGEN™ seed treatments; Lumisena™; Lumiverd®; Lumiscend®; Lumiscend® Pro; Lumisure®; Lumiflex™; Lumiante™; LumiTreo™; Dermacor™ X-100; Vertisan® ST; Lumiderm®; Lumivia™ CPL; Lumivia™ and Lumialza™\n 5\nTable Of Contents\nPart I\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS,\n \ncontinued\nIn connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines focused on rapidly ramping up differentiated technology solutions, in 2019 the company began accelerating the ramp up of the Enlist E3\nTM\n trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer\n®\n brands. Due to the five-year ramp-up of Enlist E3\nTM\n, the company significantly reduced the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield\n®\n and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend\n® \nherbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the Roundup Ready 2 Yield\n®\n and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend\n®\n traits thereafter for the remaining term of the non-exclusive license with the Monsanto Company. Refer to Prepaid Royalties within the Critical Accounting Estimates section on page 55 for additional information.\nDistribution\nThe Seed segment has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the company’s brands to customers, primarily through the company’s multi-channel, multi-brand strategy, which includes four differentiated channels: Pioneer agency model, regional brands, retail brands, as well as third parties through licensing and distribution channels.\nThe Pioneer agency model is unique to Corteva and represents sales made directly to farmers via independent sales representatives. Through this agency model, the company interacts directly with farmers at multiple points in the growing season, from prior to planting all the way through harvest. These regular interactions enable the company to provide the advice and service farmers need while giving the company real-time insights into the customers’ future ordering decisions. The company’s regional brands connect to customers through regional brand employees and farmer-dealer networks. Retail brands provide a one-stop shop for seed and chemistry solutions and may include sales to distributors, agricultural cooperatives, and dealers. Finally, Corteva out-licenses traits and germplasm to third parties.\nKey Raw Materials\nThe key raw materials for the Seed segment include corn and soybean seeds. To produce high-quality seeds, the company contracts with third-party growers globally. Corteva focuses on production close to the customer to provide the seed product, which is suitable for that region and its weed, insect and disease challenges, weather, soil and other conditions. The company conditions and packages the seeds using its own plants and third-party contract manufacturers. By striking a balance between owning production facility assets directly and contracting with third-party growers, the company believes it is best able to maintain flexibility to react to demand changes unique to each geography while minimizing costs. The company seeks to collaborate with strategic seed growers and share its digital agronomy and product management knowledge with them. The company’s third-party growers are an important part of its supply chain. Corteva provides them with rigorous training, planning tools and access to a system that tests and advances products matched to specific geographic needs.\nThe Seed segment's research and development (\"R&D\") and supply chain groups work seamlessly to select and maintain product characteristics that enhance the quality of its seed products and solutions. Corteva focuses on customer-driven innovation to deliver superior germplasm and trait technologies. With its large sets of digitized data and its seed field management solution, the company can manage its field operations efficiently and draw insights from data quickly and effectively. This allows the company’s supply chain to react quickly to changing customer needs and provides R&D with tremendous amounts of data to analyze and incorporate into resource allocation decisions. The company continues to invest in and build capabilities that drive value via data digitization and analytics that enable it to create an even more responsive and efficient answer to customer needs.\n 6\nTable Of Contents\nPart I\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS,\n \ncontinued\nCrop Protection\nThe Crop Protection segment serves the global agricultural input industry with products that protect against weeds, insects and other pests, and disease, and that support overall crop health both above and below ground via nitrogen management and seed-applied technologies. The segment's crop protection solutions and digital solutions provide farmers tools to improve productivity and profitability, and help keep fields free of weeds, insects and diseases. The company is a leader in global herbicides, insecticides, nitrogen stabilizers, pasture and range management herbicides and biologicals.\nA summary of the Crop Protection segment’s net sales by major product line and geographic region (based on customer location) are as follows:\n \nProducts and Brands\n \nThe Crop Protection segment’s major brands and technologies, by key product line, are listed below:\nInsect and Nematode Management\nCLOSER™; DELEGATE\n®\n; INTREPID\n®\n; ISOCLAST™; EXALT®; PEXALON™; TRANSFORM™; VYDATE\n®\n; OPTIMUM\n®\n; Reklemel™; SALIBRO™; PYRAXALT™; QALCOVA™; JEMVELVA™; RADIANT™; SENTRICON\n®\n; ENTRUST\n®\n SC; SUCCESS®; TRACER™; LANNATE®; EXPEDITION®; SPINTOR®\nDisease Management\nAPROACH PRIMA\n®\n; VESSARYA\n®\n; APROACH\n®\n; APROACH POWER\n®\n; VIOVAN\n®\n; TALENDO™; VERBEN\n®\n; EQUATION PRO\n®\n; EQUATION CONTACT\n®\n; ZORVEC™; INATREQ™; CURZATE™; TANOS\n®\n; BIM® MAX; BEAM®; FONTELIS™; ACANTO™; GALILEO\n®\n; UNIVOQ™\nWeed Control\nARYLEX\n®\n; ENLIST™ weed control system; ENLIST ONE™; BROADWAY™; RINSKOR™; MUSTANG\n®\n; GALLANT™; VERDICT\n®\n; KERB\n®\n; PIXXARO\n®\n; QUELEX™; KORVETTO\n®\n; REXADE™; GALLERY\n®\n; SNAPSHOT\n®\n; VIPER\n®\n; BELKAR\n®\n; WIDEMATCH\n®\n; PERFECTMATCH\n®\n; CLINCHER®; GARLON™; TORDON®; REMEDY®; PASTAR®; SONIC\n®\n; TEXARO\n®\n; KEYSTONE\n®\n; PACTO\n®\n; LIGATE\n®\n; DIMENSION\n®\n; TOPSHOT®; RICER\n®\n; LOYANT™; ROYANT®; JAGUAR®; AGIXA\nTM\n, NOVIXID\n®\n, NOVLECT™; REALM\n®\n Q; LONTREL\n®\n; GRAZON\n®\n; PAXEO\n®\n; RESICORE\n®\n REV; SPIDER\n®\n; STARANE\nTM\n; SURESTART\n®\n; COACT®; SIMPLICITY®; REZUVANT®; PALLAS™; DURACOR®; TOLVERA™; ONDECK®; GAPPER®; ELEVORE®; LADIVA®\nNitrogen Management\nINSTINCT\n®\n; N-SERVE\n®\n Nitrogen Stabilizer; FULTIME®; VOLLEY®\nBiologicals\nSTIMULATE™; UTRISHA™ N; BlueN™; STARTER™ and HARVEST MORE®\nOther\nLANDVisor™\n 7\nTable Of Contents\nPart I\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS,\n \ncontinued\nKey Raw Materials\nThe key raw materials and supplies for the Crop Protection segment include chlorinated pyridines derivatives, specialty intermediates and technical grade active ingredients, chlorine, and seed treatments. Typically, the company purchases major raw materials through long-term contracts with multiple suppliers, which sometimes require minimum purchase commitments. Certain important raw materials are supplied by a few major suppliers. The company expects the markets for its raw materials to remain balanced. The company relies on contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain inputs or key components for its product formulations. These inputs are sourced globally and the company generally formulates its products close to its end customers. Shifts in customer demand, reduced local availability of raw materials, and/or production capacity constraints may, at times, necessitate sourcing from an alternative geography. The company strives to maintain multiple high-quality supply sources for each input.\nCorteva’s supply chain strategy involves managing global supplies of active and intermediate ingredients sourced regionally with global best practices and oversight. Corteva’s supply strategy includes a robust and flexible global footprint to meet future portfolio growth. The company’s supply chain also provides competitive advantages including reducing time to meet customer requirements in regions while minimizing costs through the value chain.\nSeasonality\nCorteva’s sales are generally strongest in the first half of the calendar year, which aligns with the planting and growing season in the northern hemisphere. The company typically generates about 65 percent of its sales in the first half of the calendar year, driven by northern hemisphere Seed and Crop Protection sales. The company generates about 35 percent of its sales in the second half of the calendar year, led by Seed sales in the southern hemisphere. The seasonality in sales impacts both the Seed and Crop Protection segments. The company’s direct distribution channel, where products are shipped to farmers, is more affected by planting delays than its competitors. Generally speaking, unfavorable weather slows the planting season and can affect the company’s quarterly results and sales mix. Severe unfavorable weather, however, can impact overall sales. Accounts receivable tends to be higher during the first half of the year, consistent with the peak sales period in the northern hemisphere, with cash collection focused in the fourth quarter.\nHuman Capital Management\nCorteva aims to attract the best employees, to retain those employees through offering career development and training opportunities while also prioritizing their safety and wellness in an inclusive and productive work environment. The company’s strong employee base of approximately 22,000 employees, along with its commitment to Corteva’s core values, is a key element to the success of its business.\nWorkforce Composition.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, the company globally employs approximately 22,000 employees. In order to address regional specific customer needs within its global business, the company has a geographically diverse employee base with 47 percent, 21 percent, 20 percent, and 12 percent located in North America, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific regions, respectively. \nApproximately 2 percent of the United States workforce is unionized and another 13 percent of our global workforce participate in works councils and collective bargaining arrangements outside the United States. In 2024, the company did not experience any work stoppages due to strike or lockouts.\nSafety.  \nLiving safely is one of the company’s core values by which the company manages its business. The company has implemented safety programs and management practices to promote a culture of safety to protect its employees, as well as the environment. This includes required trainings for employees, as well as specific qualifications and certifications for certain operational employees. \nInclusion.  \nThe company has a robust inclusion and belonging vision and strategy, based upon the belief that embracing individual differences benefits the company by creating a workforce with a greater variety of skills and perspectives as a result of their differentiated backgrounds and experiences. Specific inclusion and belonging initiatives are identified and tracked to create a culture of belonging that is designed to create an inclusive environment where the best talent is attracted, retained, and engaged. Critical to creating this environment are company-sponsored employee business resource groups (“BRGs”) that support and promote certain mutual objectives of both the employee and the company, including community engagement and the professional development of employees. The BRGs are open to all employees and provide a voluntary space where employees can foster connections within a supportive environment. The company maintains nine global BRGs, each led by a member of the company’s senior leadership: Disability Awareness Network; Global African Heritage Alliance; Global \n 8\nTable Of Contents\nPart I\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS,\n \ncontinued\nIndigenous Peoples Alliance; Growing Asian Impact Network; Latin Network; Pride; Professional Learning Acceleration Network; Veteran’s Network; and Women’s Inclusion Network. \nThe company monitors its recruitment and talent development processes, in order to prevent and detect inequities and potentially discriminatory practices that could negatively impact the creation of an inclusive culture and the retention of key talent for our leadership pipeline. The company reviews its inclusion and belonging efforts through periodic engagement surveys and other measures. The results of the company’s efforts, along with its inclusion and belonging strategy, are reviewed periodically with the company’s management, and through annual reviews of the company’s leadership pipelines and inclusion and belonging programs with the People and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. \nExperienced Management.  \nThe company believes its management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute its strategy and advance its product pipelines and technology. The company's chief executive officer and business presidents have an average of approximately 20 years of agriculture experience and are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding its position as a global force in the agriculture industry. \nIntellectual Property\nCorteva considers its intellectual property estate, which includes patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, in the aggregate, to constitute a valuable asset of Corteva and actively seeks to secure intellectual property rights as part of an overall strategy to protect its investment in innovations and maximize the results of its research and development program. While the company believes that its intellectual property estate, taken as a whole, provides a competitive advantage in many of its businesses, no single patent, trademark, license or group of related patents or licenses is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of the company’s segments.\nTrade secrets are also an important element of the company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make Corteva products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. Corteva vigilantly protects its intellectual property. When the company discovers that its intellectual property has been unlawfully taken, it will take measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the company and/or unjust enrichment, as well as reporting the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate.\nPatents & Trademarks. \n Corteva continually applies for and obtains U.S. and foreign patents and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. Corteva’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company in the aggregate. The protection afforded by these patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. This significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2024, the company owned about 5,800 U.S. patents and about 10,600 active patents outside of the U.S. \nRemaining life of granted patents owned as of December 31, 2024:\nApproximate U.S.\nApproximate Other Countries\nWithin 5 years\n1,000\n2,200\n6 to 10 years\n2,100\n5,600\n11 to 15 years\n1,900\n2,600\n16 to 20 years\n800\n200\nTotal\n5,800\n10,600\nIn addition to its owned patents, the company owns approximately 3,900 patent applications.\nThe company also owns or has licensed a substantial number of trade names, trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and other countries, including approximately 1,800 registrations and 1,000 pending trademark applications in a number of jurisdictions.\nIn addition, the company holds multiple long-term biotechnology trait licenses from third parties in the normal course of business. Most corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits licensed from third parties under these long-term licenses.\n 9\nTable Of Contents\nPart I\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS,\n \ncontinued\nCompetition\nThe company competes with producers of seed germplasm, trait developers, and crop protection products on a global basis. The global market for products within the industry is highly competitive and the company believes competition has and will continue to intensify. Corteva competes based on germplasm and trait leadership, price, quality and cost competitiveness and the offering of a holistic solution. The company’s key competitors include BASF, Bayer, FMC, Syngenta and ChemChina, as well as companies trading in generic crop protection chemicals and regional seed companies.\nEnvironmental Matters \nInformation related to environmental matters is included in several areas of this report: (1) Environmental Proceedings beginning on page 27; (2) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on pages 58-60; and (3) Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulatory Considerations\nOur Seed and Crop Protection products and operations are subject to certain approval procedures, manufacturing requirements and environmental protection laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We evaluate and test products throughout the research and development phases, and each new technology undergoes further rigorous scientific studies and tests to validate that the product can be used effectively and that use of the technology is safe for humans and animals and does not cause undue harm to the environment when used in accordance with the directions for use.\nThe regulatory approval processes and procedures globally are becoming increasingly more complex, which has resulted in additional testing needs, longer approval timelines that are difficult to predict, and higher development and maintenance costs. We continue to invest on an ongoing basis to keep dossiers current, respond to regulators and meet evolving regulatory standards required by global regulatory frameworks. Failure to comply with these regulations or future regulatory bans and requirements related to our products and their use may materially impact our financial performance. The increase in timelines for regulatory approvals may result in the company not achieving its sustainability targets, or its anticipated returns on research and development investments.\nRegulation of Genetically Modified Organisms (“GMOs”) and Gene Editing\nGenetically modified seed products are subject to regulatory approval processes and procedures. For example, in the United States, the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology governs genetically modified or gene edited organisms, using existing U.S. legislation and legal authorities on food, feed and environmental safety. Plant GMOs are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (the “USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (the “APHIS”) under the Plant Protection Act. The APHIS assesses the trait to ensure that the trait will not pose a plant pest and is not a noxious weed. GMOs in food are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”). The FDA ensures that the food is safe for food and feed. Pesticides and microorganisms containing GMOs are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (the “FIFRA”) and the Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA assesses the trait or the stack containing the traits to ensure that there is no unreasonable adverse effect to the environment.\nOther countries also have rigorous approval processes, procedures, and scientific testing requirements for the cultivation or import of genetically modified seed products and gene editing technology. In the United States and other countries that have functioning regulatory systems, a rigorous scientific review is conducted by these agencies to demonstrate that genetically modified and gene edited products are as safe as traditionally bred, non-biotech/GMO counterparts for food, feed and the environment. Various countries in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific have banned GMOs entirely.\nRegulation of Crop Protection Products\nGlobally, manufacturers of crop protection products, including herbicides, fungicides and insecticides are required to submit an application/dossier and obtain government regulatory approval prior to selling products in a particular country. In the United States, the EPA is responsible for registering and overseeing the approval and marketing of pesticides, pursuant to the FIFRA, the FFDCA and the Food Quality Protection Act. Also, the USDA and the FDA monitor levels of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops. Already registered pesticides are required to be re-registered every 15 years to ensure that those products continue to meet the rigorous safety standards set by the regulators. The EPA reevaluates pesticide tolerances at least every 10 years, taking into account ecological and human health risks, in addition to cumulative risks as a result of multiple routes and sources of exposure. For certain crop protection applications, we rely on the availability of data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n \nto address potential risks to human health. \n 10\nTable Of Contents\nPart I\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS,\n \ncontinued\nBeginning in January 2022, before registering any new conventional pesticide active ingredient, the EPA evaluates the potential effects on listed species and their designated critical habitats under the Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”). The EPA also has initiated such evaluations for certain other active ingredients in response to existing or threatened litigation. Where the EPA determines that a pesticide in the registration and re-evaluation processes “may affect” a listed species, the EPA must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. As part of its approval, registration, and reevaluation processes, the EPA may impose certain use restrictions on crop protection products under the ESA. When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service add additional listed specifies, the EPA may initiate new ESA evaluations. Under the citizen suit provisions, the ESA also includes citizen suit provisions that allow the public to bring suit in court against federal agencies when they believe a listed species is not being adequately protected by the EPA. FIFRA contains similar provisions that allow the public to challenge an EPA’s registration decision. These lawsuits may subject products to additional use limitations and labeling requirements and further studies, as well as result in registrations being revoked, in whole or in part.\nThe company's European operations are subject to the European chemical regulation REACH (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals”) and the CLP (“Classification, Labeling, and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures”). Other jurisdictions also have rigorous approval processes, procedures and scientific testing requirements for the approval of crop protection products. We continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments related to pollution and other environmental health and safety matters.\nAvailable Information\nThe company's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports are accessible on Corteva's website at http://investors.corteva.com by clicking on the section labeled \"Financial Information\", then on \"SEC Filings.\" These reports are made available, without charge, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the company files or furnishes them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Where, in any forward-looking statement or other estimate, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of the company's management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. The company disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law.

The charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily relate to asset related charges, severance and related benefit costs, contract termination charges, and decommissioning and demolition costs associated with the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program and non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense related to Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits.\n•\nIncome from continuing operations after income taxes was $863 million, as compared to $941 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n•\nOperating EBITDA was $3,376 million, down from $3,381 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by competitive Crop Protection pricing and continued investment in Seed research and development, partially offset by Seed pricing gains, the reduction of royalty expense and ongoing cost and productivity actions. Refer to page 44 for further discussion of the company's Non-GAAP financial measures.  \nIn addition to the financial highlights above, the following events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024: \n•\nThe company returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2024 under its previously announced share repurchase programs and through common stock dividends.\n•\nOn July 29, 2024, the company's Board of Directors approved a 6.25 percent increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.16 per share to $0.17 per share. \nPriorities \nThe company believes the following priorities will continue to create significant value for its customers and shareholders over the mid-term: \n•\nFocus on Execution \n– the company will focus on a value creation framework and its four key catalysts: (1) the delivery of top tier technology in our prioritized core markets and crops while achieving best-in-class cost performance; (2) a continued move towards Seed royalty neutrality; (3) a continued improvement in our product mix to strengthen focus on differentiation and yield advantage; and (4) operational improvements focused on driving price and productivity improvements.\n•\nDeliver Innovation to Farmers, Faster \n \n– Corteva aims to deliver greater value and productivity to growers through more differentiated and sustainably advantaged solutions, which in turn promise to strengthen global food security and help farmers address the impacts of climate change.\n•\nDeploy capital with discipline \n– the company aims to prioritize investment, growth, M&A opportunities and returning cash to shareholders.\n 31\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nAnalysis of Operations \nAcquisitions\nOn March 1, 2023, Corteva completed its acquisitions of all the outstanding equity interests in Stoller Group Inc. (“Stoller”), one of the largest independent companies in the Biologicals industry, and Quorum Vital Investment, S.L. and its affiliates (“Symborg”), an expert in microbiological technologies. The purchase price for Stoller and Symborg was $1,220 million, inclusive of a working capital adjustment, and $370 million, respectively. These acquisitions supplement the Crop Protection business with additional biological tools that complement evolving farming practices. See Note 4 - Business Combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\nCrop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program \nOn November 5, 2023, management of the company approved a plan to further optimize its Crop Protection network of manufacturing and external partners (the \"Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program\"). The plan includes the exit of the company’s production activities at its site in Pittsburg, California, as well as ceasing operations in select manufacturing lines at other locations. In October 2024, management of the company amended the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program to include updates to its previous estimates and decommissioning and demolition costs associated with the ceasing of operations, primarily at the Pittsburg, California site.\nThe company expects to record aggregate pre-tax restructuring and asset related charges of $650 million to $700 million, comprised of $85 million to $105 million of severance and related benefit costs, $320 million to $340 million of asset-related and impairment charges, and $245 million to $255 million of costs related to exiting the company's production activities and ceasing operations (inclusive of contract terminations and decommissioning and demolition costs). Decommissioning and demolition costs are expensed on an as-incurred basis. Reductions in workforce are subject to local regulatory requirements. Through the year ended December 31, 2024, the company recorded net pre-tax restructuring and asset related charges of $461 million inception-to-date under the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program, consisting of $91 million of severance and related benefit costs, $327 million of asset-related and impairment charges, $10 million of decommissioning and demolition costs and $33 million of costs related to contract terminations.\nCash payments related to these charges are anticipated to be $330 million to $360 million, which primarily relate to the payment of severance and related benefits, decommissioning and demolition costs and contract terminations. Through December 31, 2024, the company paid $64 million associated with these charges. The restructuring actions associated with these charges are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2026.\nThe Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program is expected to contribute to the company’s ongoing cost and productivity improvement efforts through achieving an estimated $180 million of savings on a run rate basis by 2027. Future actions by the company or changes in circumstances from current assumptions, including any site disposition gains or losses, may cause actual results and future cash payments to differ. See Note 6 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\n2022 Restructuring Actions\nIn connection with the company’s shift to a global business unit model during 2022, the company assessed its business priorities and operational structure to maximize the customer experience and deliver on growth and earnings potential. As a result of this assessment, the company committed to restructuring actions during the second quarter of 2022, which included the company’s separate announcement to withdraw from Russia (\"Russia Exit\") (collectively the “2022 Restructuring Actions”). The actions associated with this program are substantially complete.\nThe remaining cash payments related to the 2022 Restructuring Actions is $30 million, and primarily relate to the payment of severance and related benefits and contract terminations.\nThe 2022 Restructuring Actions are expected to contribute to the company’s ongoing cost and productivity improvement efforts through achieving an estimated $210 million to $220 million of savings on a run rate basis by 2025. See Note\n \n6 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\n 32\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nShare Buyback Plan\nOn November 19, 2024, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (\"2024 Share Buyback Plan\"). The timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. \nOn September 13, 2022, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (\"2022 Share Buyback Plan\"). The timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. In connection with the 2022 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired 17,909,000 and 10,026,000 shares in the open market and through privately-negotiated transactions for a cost (excluding excise taxes) of $1 billion and $500 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nOn August 5, 2021, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (\"2021 Share Buyback Plan\"). The company completed the 2021 Share Buyback Plan during the first quarter of 2023 and repurchased and retired 4,098,000, 17,425,000 and 5,572,000 shares in the open market for a total cost of $250 million, $1 billion, and $250 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \nResults of Operations \nNet Sales\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales\n$\n16,908 \n$\n17,226 \n$\n17,455 \n2024 versus 2023\nNet sales were $16,908 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $17,226 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 1 percent decrease in price and a 3 percent unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by a 2 percent increase in volume. Lower pricing reflects the continued competitive price environment in Crop Protection, particularly in Latin America, partially offset by improvement in Seed pricing driven by strong demand for top technology offerings and operational execution globally. Crop Protection volume growth was the result of demand recovery in Latin America and growth of new products. Seed volume growth was driven by the expected recovery in Brazil Safrinha corn and North America soybeans and cotton, which more than offset corn area reduction and challenges in other geographies.  The unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real and Turkish Lira. \n2023 versus 2022\nNet sales were $17,226 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $17,455 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by a 10 percent decrease in volume versus the prior year and a 1 percent unfavorable impact from currency, partially offset by a 7 percent increase in price and a 3 percent favorable portfolio and other impact. Volume declines were driven by strategic product exits, Crop Protection channel inventory destocking, delayed farmer purchases, lower corn planted area in EMEA, reduced summer corn planted area and lower expected Safrinha corn planted area in Brazil, and the Russia Exit, partially offset by increased corn acres in North America. The unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Turkish Lira, Canadian Dollar and Chinese Renminbi. Price gains were driven by continued execution on the company's price for value strategy, strong demand for new technology and strong execution in response to cost inflation led by EMEA, partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Latin America and North America. The portfolio and other impact was driven by the biologicals acquisitions and the sale of seeds already under production in Russia when the decision to exit the country was made and that the company was contractually required to purchase.\n 33\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \n \nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n($ In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet Sales\n% of Net Sales\nNet Sales\n% of Net Sales\nNet Sales\n% of Net Sales\nWorldwide\n$\n16,908 \n100 \n%\n$\n17,226 \n100 \n%\n$\n17,455 \n100 \n%\nNorth America\n8,660 \n51 \n%\n8,590 \n50 \n%\n8,294 \n48 \n%\nEMEA\n3,124 \n19 \n%\n3,367 \n19 \n%\n3,256 \n19 \n%\nLatin America\n3,776 \n22 \n%\n3,906 \n23 \n%\n4,445 \n25 \n%\nAsia Pacific\n1,348 \n8 \n%\n1,363 \n8 \n%\n1,460 \n8 \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 vs. 2023\nPercent Change Due To:\nNet Sales Change\nPrice &\nPortfolio /\n($ In millions)\n$\n%\nProduct Mix\nVolume\nCurrency\nOther\nNorth America\n$\n70 \n1 \n%\n1 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nEMEA\n(243)\n(7)\n%\n5 \n%\n(7)\n%\n(3)\n%\n(2)\n%\nLatin America\n(130)\n(3)\n%\n(12)\n%\n16 \n%\n(8)\n%\n1 \n%\nAsia Pacific\n(15)\n(1)\n%\n2 \n%\n(1)\n%\n(2)\n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n$\n(318)\n(2)\n%\n(1)\n%\n2 \n%\n(3)\n%\n— \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022\nPercent Change Due To:\nNet Sales Change\nPrice &\nPortfolio /\n($ In millions)\n$\n%\nProduct Mix\nVolume\nCurrency\nOther\nNorth America\n$\n296 \n4 \n%\n6 \n%\n(2)\n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nEMEA\n111 \n3 \n%\n19 \n%\n(11)\n%\n(8)\n%\n3 \n%\nLatin America\n(539)\n(12)\n%\n2 \n%\n(25)\n%\n3 \n%\n8 \n%\nAsia Pacific\n(97)\n(7)\n%\n7 \n%\n(9)\n%\n(5)\n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n$\n(229)\n(1)\n%\n7 \n%\n(10)\n%\n(1)\n%\n3 \n%\nCost of Goods Sold (\"COGS\")\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCost of goods sold\n$\n9,529 \n$\n9,920 \n$\n10,436 \n2024 versus 2023\nCOGS was $9,529 million (56 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $9,920 million (58 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by \nfavorable currency effects, ongoing cost and productivity actions, Crop Protection raw material deflation, and a reduction in net royalty expense, partially offset by an increase in volumes and higher commodity costs. \n2023 versus 2022\nCOGS was $9,920 million (58 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $10,436 million (60 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes, ongoing cost and productivity actions and a decrease in royalty expense, partially offset by higher input costs, which are primarily macro-economic driven. The macro-economic driven trends are due to inflationary pressures impacting raw material inputs, which were expected to improve in 2024.\n 34\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nResearch and Development Expense (\"R&D\")\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nResearch and development expense\n$\n1,402 \n$\n1,337 \n$\n1,216 \n2024 versus 2023\nR&D expense was $1,402 million (8 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $1,337 million (8 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in R&D expense is in support of the company’s long-term growth plans and was primarily driven by an increase in salaries due to higher headcount, variable compensation and contractor costs, partially offset by favorable currency impacts. \n2023 versus 2022\nR&D expense was $1,337 million (8 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $1,216 million (7 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in R&D expense is in support of the company’s long-term growth plans and was primarily driven by an increase in salaries due to higher headcount and the associated spending on field, lab and facilities, and third-party research costs. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n3,196 \n$\n3,176 \n$\n3,173 \n2024 versus 2023\nSG&A expenses were $3,196 million (19 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $3,176 million (18 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The  increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries and variable compensation, commissions, bad debt expense, legal support fees and portfolio impact from the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions, partially offset by favorable currency impacts and lower consulting and professional fees and marketing costs.\n2023 versus 2022\nSG&A expenses were $3,176 million (18 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $3,173 million (18 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The flat results were primarily driven by incremental costs from the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions, an unfavorable impact relating to deferred compensation plans due to market improvements and an increase in bad debt expense, partially offset by a decrease in selling expense, variable compensation, functional spend, commissions and consulting fees.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmortization of intangibles\n$\n685 \n$\n683 \n$\n702 \n2024 versus 2023\nIntangible asset amortization was $685 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $683 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of amortization relating to the intangible assets recognized in connection with the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions, which were completed on March 1, 2023, partially offset by lower amortization on certain intangible assets arising from the Merger that became fully amortized in 2024.\n2023 versus 2022\nIntangible asset amortization was $683 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $702 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the expiration of the favorable supply contracts in the fourth quarter of 2022, at which point the contracts became fully amortized, partially offset by amortization relating to the intangible assets recognized in connection with the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions. \n 35\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nSee Note 13 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\nRestructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net\n            \nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRestructuring and asset related charges - net\n$\n288 \n$\n336 \n$\n363 \n2024\nRestructuring and asset related charges - net were $288 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was primarily comprised of a $232 million charge associated with the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program and a $55 million net charge from non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense related to the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits. The $232 million charge associated with the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program was primarily comprised of $91 million of severance and related benefit costs, $101 million of asset related charges, $10 million in decommissioning and demolition costs and $30 million of contract termination charges.\n2023\nRestructuring and asset related charges - net were $336 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily comprised of a $217 million charge related to the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program, a $72 million net charge related to non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense related to the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits and $42 million related to severance and related benefit costs, asset related charges and contract termination charges (including early lease terminations) associated with the 2022 Restructuring Actions. The $217 million net charge associated with the Crop Protection Operations Strategy Restructuring Program was primarily comprised of $214 million of asset related charges, which includes non-cash impairment charges of $152 million consisting of $92 million and $60 million related to operating lease assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, associated with the exit of the company’s production activities at its site in Pittsburg, California.\n2022\nRestructuring and asset related charges - net were $336 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was primarily comprised of a $272 million net charge related to the 2022 Restructuring Actions and $109 million of restructuring and asset related charges - net from non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense related to the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits. The $272 million net charge associated with the 2022 Restructuring Actions was comprised of $111 million of severance and related benefit costs, $104 million of asset related charges and $57 million of costs related to contract terminations (including early lease terminations). These charges were partially offset by a benefit associated with previous restructuring programs.\nSee Note 6 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense) - Net\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nOther income (expense) - net\n$\n(300)\n$\n(448)\n$\n(60)\n2024 versus 2023\nOther income (expense) - net was $(300) million and $(448) million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The impact of lower short-term borrowings and lower interest rates was offset by higher interest related to the senior notes issued in 2023 and higher foreign currency borrowings.\n2023 versus 2022\nInterest expense was $233 million and $79 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change was primarily driven by higher interest rates, the issuance of Senior Notes in connection with the May 2023 Debt Offering, and an increase in short term borrowings. \nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes on Continuing Operations \nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations\n$\n412 \n$\n152 \n$\n210 \nEffective tax rate\n32.3 \n%\n13.9 \n%\n14.7 \n%\n2024\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the company’s effective tax rate of 32.3 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1,275 million was unfavorably impacted by a $120 million charge on the establishment of a valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset position of a legal entity in Brazil, unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, a $22 million charge associated with repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. primarily from current year earnings, and the unfavorable tax impact of certain net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of the net monetary asset positions. These items were partially offset by a $(59) million benefit related to U.S. tax credits for increasing research activities and $(32) million in net tax benefits associated with changes to deferred taxes and accruals for certain prior year tax positions.\n2023\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the company’s effective tax rate of 13.9 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1,093 million was favorably impacted by a $(65) million benefit related to U.S. tax credits for increasing research activities, changes to deferred taxes and a tax currency change for legal entities within Switzerland in the amount of $(62) million and $(24) million, respectively, as well as favorable geographic mix of earnings. These items were partially offset by the unfavorable tax impact of certain net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of the net monetary asset positions, which were not deductible in their local jurisdictions, a $46 million charge associated with intellectual property realignment, and a $32 million charge associated with repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. primarily from current year earnings.\n2022\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the company’s effective tax rate of 14.7 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1,426 million was favorably impacted by tax benefits relating to the establishment of deferred taxes in connection with the impact of a change in a U.S. legal entity's tax characterization, a worthless stock deduction in the U.S., and the release of a valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset position of a legal entity in Brazil in the amount of $(55) million, $(42) million and $(36) million, respectively. These items were partially offset by the unfavorable tax impact of certain net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not deductible in their local jurisdictions, and a $24 million charge associated with repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. primarily from current year earnings.\n 37\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations After Income Taxes\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations after income taxes\n$\n56 \n$\n(194)\n$\n(58)\n2024 \nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations after income taxes was $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The company defines segment operating EBITDA as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, corporate expenses, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB credits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments and environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. See Note 23 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (costs) excluded from segment operating EBITDA. All references to prices are based on local price unless otherwise specified.\nA reconciliation of segment operating EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations after income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is included in Note 23 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nSeed\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales\n$\n9,545 \n$\n9,472 \n$\n8,979 \nSegment operating EBITDA\n$\n2,219 \n$\n2,117 \n$\n1,656 \nSeed\n2024 vs. 2023\nPercent Change Due To:\nNet Sales Change\nPrice &\nPortfolio /\n($ In millions)\n$\n%\nProduct Mix\nVolume\nCurrency\nOther\nNorth America\n$\n265 \n5 \n%\n4 \n%\n1 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nEMEA\n(41)\n(3)\n%\n9 \n%\n(3)\n%\n(5)\n%\n(4)\n%\nLatin America\n(114)\n(7)\n%\n(7)\n%\n8 \n%\n(8)\n%\n— \n%\nAsia Pacific\n(37)\n(8)\n%\n9 \n%\n(15)\n%\n(2)\n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n$\n73 \n1 \n%\n3 \n%\n1 \n%\n(2)\n%\n(1)\n%\nSeed\n2024 vs. 2023\nPercent Change Due To:\nNet Sales Change\nPrice &\nPortfolio /\n($ In millions)\n$\n%\nProduct Mix\nVolume\nCurrency\nOther\nCorn\n$\n49 \n1 \n%\n2 \n%\n2 \n%\n(3)\n%\n— \n%\nSoybeans\n69 \n4 \n%\n2 \n%\n2 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nOther oilseeds\n(55)\n(8)\n%\n8 \n%\n(7)\n%\n(4)\n%\n(5)\n%\nOther\n10 \n2 \n%\n8 \n%\n(5)\n%\n(1)\n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n$\n73 \n1 \n%\n3 \n%\n1 \n%\n(2)\n%\n(1)\n%\n 40\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nSeed\n2023 vs. 2022\nPercent Change Due To:\nNet Sales Change\nPrice &\nPortfolio /\n($ In millions)\n$\n%\nProduct Mix\nVolume\nCurrency\nOther\nNorth America\n$\n590 \n11 \n%\n9 \n%\n3 \n%\n(1)\n%\n— \n%\nEMEA\n13 \n1 \n%\n26 \n%\n(19)\n%\n(10)\n%\n4 \n%\nLatin America\n(121)\n(7)\n%\n11 \n%\n(22)\n%\n4 \n%\n— \n%\nAsia Pacific\n11 \n3 \n%\n14 \n%\n(4)\n%\n(7)\n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n$\n493 \n5 \n%\n13 \n%\n(6)\n%\n(2)\n%\n— \n%\nSeed\n2023 vs. 2022\nPercent Change Due To:\nNet Sales Change\nPrice &\nPortfolio /\n($ In millions)\n$\n%\nProduct Mix\nVolume\nCurrency\nOther\nCorn\n$\n492 \n8 \n%\n14 \n%\n(4)\n%\n(2)\n%\n— \n%\nSoybeans\n48 \n3 \n%\n7 \n%\n(4)\n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nOther oilseeds\n(6)\n(1)\n%\n23 \n%\n(21)\n%\n(7)\n%\n4 \n%\nOther\n(41)\n(8)\n%\n7 \n%\n(15)\n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n$\n493 \n5 \n%\n13 \n%\n(6)\n%\n(2)\n%\n— \n%\nSeed\nSeed net sales were $9,545 million in 2024, up 1 percent from $9,472 million in 2023. The sales increase was driven by a 3 percent increase in price and 1 percent increase in volume partially offset by a 2 percent unfavorable currency impact and a 1 percent unfavorable portfolio impact. \nThe increase in price was driven by improvement in many products in all regions, excluding Latin America. Global corn and soybean pricing were up 2 percent. Pricing actions more than offset currency impacts in EMEA. Volume growth was driven primarily by the expected recovery in Brazil Safrinha corn and growth in North America soybeans and cotton, partially offset by reduced planted areas in EMEA, Asia Pacific and corn in Argentina.  Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real and  Turkish Lira. \nSeed operating EBITDA was $2,219 million in 2024, up 5 percent from $2,117 million in 2023. Price execution and market share gains in North America, reduction of net royalty expense and ongoing cost and productivity actions more than offset the investment in R&D, higher commodity costs, and the unfavorable impact of currency. Segment operating EBITDA margin improved by approximately 90 basis points versus the prior-year period.\nSeed net sales were $9,472 million in 2023, up 5 percent from $8,979 million in 2022. The sales increase was driven by a 13 percent increase in price, partially offset by a 6 percent decline in volume and a 2 percent unfavorable currency impact.\nThe increase in price was broad-based and driven by strong demand for top technology and operational execution globally, with global corn and soybean prices up 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Pricing actions more than offset currency impacts in EMEA. The decline in volume was driven by the 2022 decision to exit Russia, lower corn planted area in EMEA, reduced summer corn planted area and lower expected Safrinha corn planted area in Brazil, partially offset by increased corn acres in North America. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Turkish Lira and the Canadian Dollar. \nSeed operating EBITDA was $2,117 million in 2023, up 28 percent from $1,656 million in 2022. Price execution, reduction of net royalty expense, and ongoing cost and productivity actions more than offset higher commodity and input costs, lower volumes, and the unfavorable impact of currency.

The sales decrease was driven by a 5 percent decrease in price and a 3 percent unfavorable impact from currency, partially offset by a 3 percent increase in volume. \nThe price decline was primarily due to market dynamics in Latin America. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real and Turkish Lira. The increase in volumes was driven by growth in Latin America on demand for new products and spinosyns, partially offset by unfavorable weather impacts in EMEA as well as just-in-time purchasing behavior in North America. \nSegment Operating EBITDA was $1,272 million in 2024, down 7 percent from $1,374 million from 2023. Pricing pressure and the unfavorable impact of currency more than offset productivity savings, raw material deflation, and volume growth.  Segment operating EBITDA margin contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus the prior-year period. \nCrop Protection net sales were $7,754 million in 2023, up 9 percent from $8,476 million in 2022. The decrease was driven by a 14 percent decrease in volume and a 1 percent unfavorable impact from currency, partially offset by a 4 percent favorable impact from portfolio and a 2 percent increase in price.\nThe decrease in volume was driven by strategic product exits, channel inventory destocking, and delayed farmer purchases. The increase in price was led by EMEA, and mostly reflected pricing for the value of our differentiated technology, including new products, and currency in EMEA, partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Latin America and North America. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Turkish Lira and Chinese Renminbi. The portfolio impact was driven by the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions, which added approximately $420 million of net sales. \nSegment Operating EBITDA was $1,374 million in 2023, down 18 percent from $1,684 million in 2022. Pricing execution, productivity actions, and the favorable impact from the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions were more than offset by lower volumes, higher input costs, and the unfavorable impact of currency. Segment operating EBITDA margin declined by 215 basis points versus the prior-year period.\n 43\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company presents certain financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include Operating EBITDA and operating earnings (loss) per share. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year-over-year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided below.\nOperating EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB credits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments and environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. Operating earnings (loss) per share is defined as \"earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations - diluted\" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items, the after-tax impact of non-operating benefits (costs), the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing as of the Separation from DowDuPont, and the after-tax impact of net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Although amortization of the company's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of additional intangible assets. Net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting represents the non-cash net gain (loss) from changes in fair value of certain undesignated foreign currency derivative contracts. Upon settlement, which is within the same calendar year of execution of the contract, the realized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the non-qualified foreign currency derivative contracts will be reported in the relevant non-GAAP financial measures, allowing quarterly results to reflect the economic effects of the foreign currency derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.\nThe company also uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to evaluate and discuss its liquidity position and ability to generate cash. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by (used for) operating activities – continuing operations, less capital expenditures. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors with meaningful information regarding the company’s ongoing ability to generate cash through core operations, and the company’s ability to service its indebtedness, pay dividends (when declared), make share repurchases, and meet its ongoing cash needs for its operations. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the company made the decision, which was retrospectively applied, to adjust the presentation of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to separately show the cash provided by (used for) operating activities – discontinued operations, which was previously presented within cash provided by (used for) operating activities. See Note 1 – Background and Basis of Presentation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. As a result, the definition for Free Cash Flow was revised to utilize cash provided by (used for) operating activities – continuing operations. The change in definition did not have a material impact to prior years’ Free Cash Flow.

Corteva's strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings will provide access as needed to capital markets and commercial paper markets to fund seasonal working capital needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing and committed receivable repurchase facilities. Corteva considers the borrowing costs and lending terms when selecting the source to fund its operations and working capital needs.\nThe company had access to approximately $6.3 billion and $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines, which includes the uncommitted revolving credit lines relating to the Foreign Currency Loans. These facilities provide support to meet the company’s short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes, which may include funding of discretionary and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance payments, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases and redemptions of securities, funding of acquisitions and funding Corteva's costs and expenses, including the settlement of litigation. These facilities are provided to the company by highly rated and well capitalized global financial institutions.\nIn May 2023, the company issued $600 million of 4.50 percent Senior Notes due in 2026 and $600 million of 4.80 percent Senior Notes due in 2033 (the “May 2023 Debt Offering”). \nIn January 2023, the company amended and restated its May 2022 364-day revolving credit agreement (the “364-Day Revolving Credit Facility”) increasing the facility amount to $1 billion and extending the expiration date to January 2024. Borrowings under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility have an interest rate equal to Adjusted Term SOFR, which is Term SOFR plus 0.10 percent, plus the applicable margin. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility includes a provision under which the company may convert any advances outstanding prior to the maturity date into term loans having a maturity date up to one year later. In February 2023, the company drew down $1 billion under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, which was used for general corporate purposes, including funding seasonal working capital needs, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and to partially fund the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions. In May 2023, the company repaid the $1 billion loan using the proceeds from the May 2023 Debt Offering. In February 2024, the company amended and restated the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility increasing  the facility amount to $1 billion and extending the expiration date to February 2025. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. Additionally, the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2024, the company was in compliance with these covenants. \nIn May 2022, the company entered into a $3 billion, 5 year revolving credit facility and a $2 billion, 3-year revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facilities”) expiring in May 2027 and May 2025, respectively. In June 2024, the Revolving Credit Facilities were refinanced for purposes of extending the maturity dates for the five-year and three-year revolving credit facilities to June 2029 and June 2027, respectively, and lowering the facility amount of the five-year revolving credit facility to $2.85 billion and the three-year revolving credit facility to $1.9 billion. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities will have an interest rate equal to Adjusted Term SOFR, which is Term SOFR plus 0.10 percent, plus the applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facilities may serve as a substitute to the company's commercial paper program, and can be used, from time to time, for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the funding of seasonal working capital needs. The Revolving Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facilities contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2024, the company was in compliance with these covenants. \nThe company enters into short-term and long-term foreign currency loans from time-to-time by accessing uncommitted revolving credit lines to fund working capital needs of foreign subsidiaries in the normal course of business (“Foreign Currency Loans”). Interest rates are variable and determined at the time of borrowing. Total unused bank credit lines on the Foreign Currency Loans at December 31, 2024 was approximately $62 million. The company’s long-term Foreign Currency Loans have varying maturities through 2026.\n 47\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nThe company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions.\nIn September 2023 and in accordance with the Nationwide Water District Settlement, Chemours, DuPont and Corteva established a settlement fund (the “Water District Settlement Fund”) and collectively contributed $1.185 billion, with Chemours contributing 50 percent, and DuPont and Corteva collectively contributing the remaining 50 percent pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement. The settling companies utilized the balance in the MOU Escrow Account, along with amounts previously expected to be contributed to the MOU Escrow Account in 2023, among other sources, to make their respective contributions to the Water District Settlement Fund. Refer to Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\nThe company has meaningful seasonal working capital needs based in part on providing financing to its customers. Working capital is funded through multiple methods including cash, commercial paper, the Revolving Credit Facilities, the 364-day Revolving Credit Facility, and factoring. \nIn May 2023, in line with seasonal working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $500 million (the \"2023 Repurchase Facility\") which expired in December 2023. Under the 2023 Repurchase Facility, Corteva sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date.\nThe company has factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell its trade receivables under both recourse and non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds in an effort to reduce its receivables risk. For arrangements that include an element of recourse, the company provides a guarantee of the trade receivables in the event of customer default. Refer to Note 10 - Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information.\nThe company also organizes agreements with third-party financial institutions who directly provide financing for select customers of its Seed and Crop Protection products in each region. Terms of the third-party loans are less than a year and programs are renewed on an annual basis. In some cases, the company guarantees a portion of the extension of such credit to such customers. Refer to Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information on the company’s guarantees.\nThe company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, of which $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are concentrated subject to local restrictions with highly rated and well capitalized global financial institutions. The underlying credit worthiness and exposures to these counterparties are monitored on a regular basis in line with the company’s overall risk management procedures. Upon actual repatriation, such earnings could be subject to withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes, and taxes resulting from the impact of foreign currency movements. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. At December 31, 2024, management believed that sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. with global operating cash flows, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities, and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities – continuing operations\n$\n2,296 \n$\n1,809 \n$\n912 \nCash provided by (used for) operating activities – continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $2,296 million compared to $1,809 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was primarily driven by favorable changes in working capital.\n \nThe favorable changes in inventories were driven by production reductions to match demand. Within accounts payable, lower payments to third-party growers resulted from lower commodity costs and production plans, supplemented by a change in inventory purchasing patterns. Accrued and other current liabilities benefited from a decrease in \n 48\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nsoybean royalties, while noncurrent assets and liabilities benefited from derivative settlements driven by a weaker Brazilian Real currency. These movements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in receivables driven by slower collections and higher sales on credit terms.\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities – continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,809 million compared to $912 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily driven by favorable changes in receivables due to lower Crop Protection sales and higher collections as well as favorable changes in inventories due to higher Seed sales and lower Crop Protection purchases. Partially offsetting these sources of cash were lower accounts payable driven by higher payments to third-party growers and higher seed production costs and the timing of payments to lenders for providing financing to select customers. \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities – discontinued operations\n$\n(151)\n$\n(40)\n$\n(40)\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities – discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $(151) million and $(40) million, respectively. The cash outflows were primarily related to PFAS activities that are subject to the MOU with Chemours and DuPont associated with environmental remediation activities primarily at Chemours’ Fayetteville Works facility. In addition, the disbursement of the cash held in the Water District Settlement Fund is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2024. These outflows were partially offset by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to legacy matters.\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities – discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $(40) million. The cash outflows were primarily related to PFAS activities that are subject to the MOU with Chemours and DuPont associated with environmental remediation activities primarily at Chemours’ Fayetteville Works facility and certain legal matters, which were paid in 2023.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by (used for) investing activities\n$\n(589)\n$\n(1,987)\n$\n(632)\nCash provided by (used for) investing activities was $(589) million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $(1,987) million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was primarily due to the acquisitions of Stoller and Symborg in 2023, partially offset by lower current year proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and higher proceeds from sales of property, businesses, and consolidated companies in 2023.\nCash provided by (used for) investing activities was $(1,987) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $(632) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to the acquisitions of Stoller and Symborg and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, partially offset by lower purchases of investments and the proceeds from the settlement of the net investment hedge.\nCapital expenditures totaled $597 million, $595 million, and $605 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The company expects 2025 capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by (used for) financing activities\n$\n(1,199)\n$\n(99)\n$\n(1,180)\nCash provided by (used for) financing activities was $(1,199) million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $(99) million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

In addition, there were additional \n 49\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nborrowings in 2023 to partially fund the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions. These lower current year borrowings were offset by higher payments on debt and higher repurchases of common stock and paid dividends in 2024.\nCash provided by (used for) financing activities was $(99) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $(1,180) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to the May 2023 Debt Offering and higher borrowings to fund working capital needs, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and to partially fund the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions. The change was also driven by lower share repurchases.\nDuring 2024, the company's Board of Directors authorized and paid quarterly dividends on its common stock of $0.16 in the first and second quarters and $0.17 in third and fourth quarters, respectively. \nOn November 19, 2024, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (\"2024 Share Buyback Plan\"). The timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. \nOn September 13, 2022, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (\"2022 Share Buyback Plan\"). The timing, price and volume of purchases in connection with the 2022 Share Buyback Plan will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. In connection with the 2022 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired 17,909,000 shares and 10,026,000 shares in the open market and through privately-negotiated transactions for a cost (excluding excise taxes) of $1 billion and $500 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOn August 5, 2021, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (“2021 Share Buyback Plan”). The company completed the 2021 Share Buyback Plan during the first quarter of 2023 and repurchased and retired 4,098,000, 17,425,000 and 5,572,000 shares in the open market for a total cost of $250 million, $1 billion, and $250 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \nFor the full year 2025, the company expects repurchases of approximately $1 billion under the 2022 Share Buyback Plan and 2024 Share Buyback Plan discussed above. The total amount, timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other market and company specific factors.\nEIDP Liquidity Discussion\nAs discussed in EIDP Note 1 - Basis of Presentation, to the EIDP Consolidated Financial Statements, EIDP is a subsidiary of Corteva, Inc. and continues to be a reporting company, subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act.

Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nPension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits\nAccounting for employee benefit plans involves assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and OPEB plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.\nMost of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. For U.S. benefit plans, the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. \n 51\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nFor the non-U.S. benefit plans, the company primarily utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. The weighted average discount rates used in developing the expected 2025 net periodic pension and OPEB costs were 5.59 percent and 5.50 percent, respectively. \nFor the U.S. plan, the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining the 2024 net periodic pension cost in the U.S., an assumption of 4.50 percent for expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was used. After re-evaluating the current strategic asset allocation and market conditions, the company increased the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption to 6.00 percent to be used in determining the 2025 net periodic pension cost in the U.S. Consistent with prior years, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets. For the non-U.S. plans, the strategic asset allocations are selected in accordance with the laws and practices for each country.\nI\nn determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months.\nThe following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:\n(In billions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nMarket-related value of assets\n$\n10.6 \n$\n11.9 \n$\n13.6 \nFair value of plan assets\n \n$\n10.4 \n$\n11.4 \n$\n12.3 \nFor plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. \nThe following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024:\nPre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)\n(Dollars in millions)\n1/4 Percentage\nPoint\nIncrease\n1/4 Percentage\nPoint\nDecrease\nDiscount rate\n$\n(14)\n$\n15 \nExpected rate of return on plan assets\n$\n26 \n$\n(26)\nAdditional information with respect to pension and OPEB expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under \"Long-Term Employee Benefits\" beginning on page 56 and in Note 18 - Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2024, the company had accrued obligations of $478 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $46 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (\"PRPs\") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately $600 million above the accrued obligations amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of \n 52\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \noperations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see \"Environmental Matters\" section on page 58 and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLegal Contingencies\nThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIndemnification Assets \nThe company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by DuPont, Dow and Chemours. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of DuPont, Dow and/or Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information related to indemnifications.\nIncome Taxes \nThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.\nDeferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material.\n 53\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nAt December 31, 2024, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $77 million, inclusive of a valuation allowance of $666 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. \nSee Note 8 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\nValuation of Assets and Impairment Considerations\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, EBITDA margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.\nAssessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environment in which the company's segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.\nThe company tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually (during the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative and / or quantitative testing procedures. The company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level, which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. The company’s reporting units are Seed and Crop Protection. \nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.\nIf additional quantitative testing is required, the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill associated with the reporting unit. The company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach), utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs.\nUnder the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include future cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the tax rate. The company’s estimates of future cash flows are \n 54\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nbased on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and assumed business strategy from a market participant perspective and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on such strategy. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts. The company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzes published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts.\nEstimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Based on the qualitative annual goodwill impairment analyses performed in the fourth quarter 2024, it was concluded more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and, therefore, a quantitative test was not performed. No goodwill impairment charge was necessary. \nPrepaid Royalties\nThe company’s Seed segment currently has certain third-party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license. The rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty. \nAt December 31, 2024, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was approximately $65 million and $160 million, respectively. Through June 30, 2024, the prepaid royalties balance largely related to the non-exclusive license in the United States and Canada for the Monsanto Company's Genuity\n®\n Roundup Ready 2 Yield\n®\n glyphosate tolerance trait and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend\n®\n glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans, which was obtained by the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. (“Pioneer”) (“Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement”).  \nIn connection with the departure from these traits in the company's product portfolio in favor of the Enlist E3\nTM\n trait platform, beginning January 1, 2020 the company presents and discloses accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense associated with these prepaid royalties as a component of restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense represents the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the Roundup Ready 2 Yield\n®\n and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend\n®\n trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, the Enlist E3\nTM\n trait platform has grown to 65 percent of our soybean portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company recognized charges of $55 million in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations from non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense, which as of the end of the second quarter of 2024 is complete. For further discussion of accelerated prepaid royalty amortization, refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nCertain Guarantee Contracts\nInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not made significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.\nMOU Escrow Contributions\nOn January 22, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, Corteva and EIDP entered into a binding memorandum of understanding containing a settlement to resolve legal disputes originating from the Delaware Litigation and Pending Arbitration, and to establish a cost sharing arrangement for potential future legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) liabilities arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct (the “MOU”). Under the terms of the MOU, Corteva’s estimated aggregate share of the potential $2 billion is approximately $600 million. In order to support and manage any potential future PFAS liabilities, the parties have also agreed \n 55\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nto establish an escrow account (\"MOU Escrow Account\"). The MOU provides that contributions to the MOU Escrow Account will be made by Chemours, DuPont and Corteva, annually over an eight-year period through 2028. Over this period, Chemours will deposit a total of $500 million in the account and DuPont and Corteva, together, will deposit an additional $500 million pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement. Additionally, if on December 31, 2028, the balance of the MOU Escrow Account (including interest) is less than $700 million, Chemours will make 50% of the deposits and DuPont and Corteva, together, will make 50% of the deposits necessary to restore the balance of the escrow account to $700 million pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement.\nThe company made its annual installment deposits due to the MOU Escrow Account through December 31, 2024, waiving the contribution due in 2023 pursuant to the supplemental agreement to the MOU executed by Chemours, DuPont and Corteva provided certain conditions were met. Refer to Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details on the MOU and funding of the MOU Escrow Account.\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist of long-term debt, operating and finance lease obligations and environmental remediation obligations. Refer to Note 15 - Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, Note 14 – Leases, and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively, for further discussion.\nInformation related to the company's other significant contractual obligations are summarized in the following table:\n \n \nPayments Due In\n(In millions)\nTotal at\nDecember 31, 2024\n2025\n2026 and\nbeyond\nExpected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments \n     through maturity\n$\n459 \n$\n100 \n$\n359 \nPurchase obligations\n1\n2,242 \n685 \n1,557 \nLicense agreements\n2, 3\n207 \n46 \n161 \nOther liabilities\n2, 4\n274 \n41 \n233 \nTotal \n5\n$\n3,182 \n$\n872 \n$\n2,310 \n1.\nRepresents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement.\n2.\nIncluded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n3.    Represents undiscounted remaining payments under Pioneer license agreements (approximately $188 million on a discounted basis).\n4.    Includes liabilities related to employee-related benefits other than pension and other post-employment benefits, asset retirement obligations and other noncurrent liabilities.\n5.    Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 8 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail.\nThe company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. \nLong-Term Employee Benefits \nThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (\"other post-employment benefits\" or \"OPEB\"). Substantially all of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. \nPension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.\n 56\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nBenefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans, and on November 30, 2018, the company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans, resulting in the participants no longer accruing additional benefits. In addition, OPEB eligible employees who were under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post-employment medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-employment medical, dental and life insurance plans, but are eligible to participate in the defined contribution plans.\nIn December 2020, the company amended its retiree medical, dental and life insurance plans resulting in the company no longer providing retiree dental and life insurance benefits effective January 1, 2022 and Corteva’s portion of the cost of non-Medicare retiree medical coverage no longer being adjusted for cost increases, which capped the Corteva cost at the level as of December 31, 2021 (\"2020 OPEB Plan Amendments\"). As a result of these changes, the company recorded a $939 million decrease in OPEB benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 with a corresponding prior service benefit within other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. A substantial amount of the prior service benefit within other comprehensive income (loss) in 2020 was recognized in other income (expense) - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2021 with the remainder recognized during 2022.\nPension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company did not make contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nFunding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tend to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $5 million, $5 million, and $6 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nU.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $45 million, $47 million, and $53 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nThe company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $\n101\n million, $97 million, and $122 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of per capita health care cost, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.\nIn 2025, the company expects to contribute approximately $\n40\n million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan and approximately $\n105\n million to its OPEB plans. The company does not anticipate making contributions to its principal U.S. pension plan in 2025.\nThe company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet periodic benefit (credit) cost - pension and OPEB\n$\n160 \n$\n138 \n$\n(142)\nDefined contributions\n146 \n146 \n133 \nLong-term employee benefit plan (credit) charges - continuing operations\n$\n306 \n$\n284 \n$\n(9)\n 57\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nThe above (credit) charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Long-term employee benefit plan (credits) costs were $306 million and $284 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change is mainly due to a decrease in asset values. See \"Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits\" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 51 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.\nFor 2025, long-term employee benefit costs are expected to decrease by approximately $125 million. The change is mainly due the increase in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the U.S plan net of the increase in the discount rates.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.\nPre-tax environmental expenses charged to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below: \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEnvironmental operating costs\n$\n168 \n$\n178 \n$\n154 \nEnvironmental remediation costs\n1\n42 \n47 \n84 \n$\n210 \n$\n225 \n$\n238 \n1.\nEnvironmental remediation costs include costs that are subject to the $200 million threshold and sharing arrangements as discussed in Note 16 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the header Corteva Separation Agreement.\nEnvironmental Operating Costs \nAs a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. \nAbout 85 percent of total pre-tax environmental operating costs charged to income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years.

However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Refer to Note 16 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further details on the company’s accrued obligations at December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"Superfund\") or similar state laws at 507 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 60 of the 507 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at about 212 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in \"de minimis buyouts\" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. There were no new notices in 2024 and two new notices in 2023. \nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures \nCapital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $8 million in 2025.\nClimate Change \nThe company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities, of which the Sustainability and Innovation Committee of the Board of Directors maintains oversight. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues. Across its business, individuals who are responsible for climate-related initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives. \nContinuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. \nExtreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on our customers’ ability to use the company's products and seed supply, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture \n 59\nTable Of Contents\nPart II\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, \ncontinued \nand mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its enterprise risk management program.\nWhile Corteva is working to reduce its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses, it also invests in enabling innovation that can create a more resilient agriculture value chain.
