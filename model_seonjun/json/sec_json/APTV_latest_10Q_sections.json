MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help you understand the business operations and financial condition of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Financial Statements. Our MD&A is presented in eight sections:\n•\nExecutive Overview\n•\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n•\nResults of Operations by Segment\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n•\nContingencies and Environmental Matters\n•\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n•\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWithin the MD&A, “Aptiv,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Old Aptiv (Aptiv PLC before the Transaction in December 2024, as defined below) and to New Aptiv (Aptiv PLC after the Transaction in December 2024, as defined below). The Company’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “APTV.”\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nWe are a global technology company focused on making the world safer, greener and more connected. We deliver solutions enabling our customers’ transition to a more electrified, software-defined future. Our technologies reach from sensor to cloud, including the software, hardware, engineered components and electrical interconnects necessary to support the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets and increasingly other mission-critical industries. Our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment provides software and advanced computing platforms, our Engineered Components Group segment provides interconnect and component solutions and our Electrical Distribution Systems segment provides low voltage and high voltage power, signal and data distribution solutions.\nWe are one of the largest vehicle technology suppliers and our customers include the 25 largest automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the world.\nIn December 2024, Old Aptiv (as defined below) completed its previously announced reorganization transaction (the “Transaction,” or the “reorganization transaction”), in which Old Aptiv established a new publicly-listed Jersey parent company, Aptiv Holdings Limited (“New Aptiv”), which is resident for tax purposes in Switzerland. As a result of the Transaction, all issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Old Aptiv were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued ordinary shares of New Aptiv. Following consummation of the Transaction, holders of Old Aptiv shares became ordinary shareholders of New Aptiv, Old Aptiv became a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Aptiv and New Aptiv was renamed “Aptiv PLC.” The previous publicly-listed Jersey parent company, which was an Irish tax resident, is referred to as “Old Aptiv” throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. New Aptiv’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol “APTV,” the same symbol under which the Old Aptiv shares were previously listed. Aptiv PLC remains a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, and continues to be subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements.\nIn December 2024, following the completion of the Transaction, Old Aptiv merged with and into Aptiv Swiss Holdings Limited (“Aptiv Swiss Holdings”), a newly formed Jersey incorporated private limited company, and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of New Aptiv, with Aptiv Swiss Holdings surviving as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of New Aptiv, and Old Aptiv ceasing to exist. Except as otherwise noted, all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Old Aptiv vested in Aptiv Swiss Holdings, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Old Aptiv became debts, liabilities and duties of Aptiv Swiss Holdings. As a result of the Transaction described above, there were no material changes in Aptiv PLC’s operations or governance. \nIn connection with the Transaction, New Aptiv assumed Old Aptiv’s long-term incentive plans and its existing obligations in connection with awards granted thereunder, and Aptiv Swiss Holdings (i) entered into a supplemental indenture to each indenture in which Aptiv Swiss Holdings assumed all of Old Aptiv’s obligations under each series of Old Aptiv’s \n55\nTable of Contents\noutstanding Notes and (ii) entered into an assumption and/or supplement agreement relating to the Credit Agreement in which New Aptiv assumed all of Old Aptiv’s obligations under the Credit Agreement as the “parent entity” thereunder. In addition, New Aptiv (i) entered into a supplemental indenture to each indenture in which New Aptiv guaranteed the outstanding Notes and (ii) entered into a guarantee joinder relating to the Credit Agreement in which New Aptiv guaranteed the obligations under the Credit Agreement. Following the reorganization transaction, Aptiv Swiss Holdings (i) replaced Old Aptiv as a guarantor of the borrowers’ obligations under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) succeeded to Old Aptiv as an obligor under the senior notes and the junior notes, and New Aptiv became a guarantor under the Credit Agreement (and will act as the “parent entity” thereunder) and the indentures.\nOn January 22, 2025, we announced our intention to pursue a separation of our Electrical Distribution Systems business through a transaction expected to be treated as a tax-free spin-off to its shareholders (the “Separation”). The Company plans to complete the Separation by March 31, 2026, subject to customary closing conditions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company incurred costs of $53 million and $100 million, respectively, related to the Separation. These costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expense within the consolidated statements of operations, are primarily related to third party professional fees associated with planning the Separation. The Company expects to continue to incur additional expenses related to the Separation through the date of completion.\nIn connection with the Separation, in the first quarter of 2025 Aptiv realigned its business into three reportable operating segments: Electrical Distribution Systems, Engineered Components Group and Advanced Safety and User Experience. Prior period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the change in reportable operating segments, consistent with the current year presentation, throughout the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur total net sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were $5.2 billion and $15.2 billion, an increase of 7% and 3% compared to the same periods of 2024, respectively. Our volumes increased 6% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, which primarily reflects volume growth in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by volume declines in Europe, compared to increased global automotive production of 4% (4% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue, “AWM”). Our volumes increased 2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which primarily reflects volume growth in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by volume declines in Europe, compared to increased global automotive production of 4% (1% on an AWM basis).\nWe are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle, including during periods of reduced industry volumes. Accordingly, we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering as conditions permit. As we operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure, as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations and on reducing our global overhead costs, as described in Note 7. Restructuring to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. We believe our strong balance sheet coupled with our flexible cost structure will position us to capitalize on improvements in OEM production volumes as economic conditions improve.\nTrends, Uncertainties and Opportunities\nEconomic conditions. \nOur business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive sales depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions. Global automotive vehicle production decreased 1% (3% on an AWM basis) from 2023 to 2024, reflecting vehicle production declines of 5% in Europe and 2% in North America, partially offset by increased production of 4% in China and 3% in South America, our smallest region. \nEconomic volatility or weakness in North America, Europe, China or, to a lesser extent, South America could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Global inflationary pressures have, at times, both reduced consumer demand for automotive vehicles and increased the price of inputs to our products, which has adversely impacted our sales and profitability, and this trend has continued in 2025. There is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the U.S. and other economies, and specifically the automotive sector. In particular, changes to international trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the “USMCA”), increases in trade tariffs, import quotas and other trade restrictions or actions, including retaliatory responses to such actions, or other political pressures have affected and could continue to affect our operations and the operations of our OEM customers, resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions. Increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability. Additionally, economic weakness may result in \n56\nTable of Contents\nshifts in the mix of future automotive sales (from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles, trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars). While our diversified customer and geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability.\nUkraine/Russia conflict. \nThe conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which began in February 2022, has had, and is expected to continue to have, negative economic impacts to both countries and to the European and global economies. In response to the conflict, the European Union (the “E.U.”), the U.S. and other nations implemented broad economic sanctions against Russia. These countries may impose further sanctions and take other actions as the situation continues.\nUkraine and Russia are significant global producers of raw materials used in our supply chain, including copper, aluminum, palladium and neon gases. Disruptions in the supply and volatility in the price of these materials and other inputs produced by Ukraine or Russia, including increased logistics costs and longer transit times, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The conflict has also increased the possibility of cyberattacks occurring, which could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Furthermore, the conflict has caused our customers to analyze their continued presence in the region and future customer production plans in the region remain uncertain.\nWe do not have a material physical presence in either Ukraine or Russia, with less than 1% of our workforce located in the countries as of December 31, 2024 and less than 1% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 generated from manufacturing facilities in those countries. However, the impacts of the conflict have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, global economies, and in particular, the European economy, a region which accounted for approximately 33% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nWe continue to monitor the situation and will seek to minimize its impact to our business, while prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees located in both countries and our compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the locations where we operate. Any of the impacts mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nGlobal supply chain disruptions. \nGlobal supply chain disruptions have in the past and could in the future lead to interruptions in our production, which could impact our ability to fully meet the vehicle production demands of OEMs at times due to events which are outside our control. For example, as a result of the rapidly evolving trade policies and tariff actions, the uncertainty in the automotive industry has increased, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. We will continue to actively monitor our global supply chain and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize the impact of any future disruptions on our business.\nIn addition, we are carrying critical inventory items and key components, and we continue to procure productive, raw material and non-critical inventory components in order to satisfy our customers’ vehicle production schedules. However, as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations, among other things, our balance of productive, raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. These changes to the production environment were primarily driven by the global supply chain disruptions that impacted the automotive industry at times during previous years. We will continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital. Normally we do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules.\nCommercializing the high-tech evolution of the automotive industry\n. The automotive industry is increasingly evolving towards the implementation of software-defined components and solutions. In particular, the industry is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially-viable, fully automated driving experience. We expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for long-term growth for our product offerings in this space. We are focused on enabling and delivering end-to-end smart mobility solutions, enabling our customers’ transition to more electrified, software-defined vehicles, accelerating the commercialization of active safety and autonomous driving technologies and providing enhanced user experience and connected services.\nAs part of our strategy to harness the full potential of connected intelligent systems across industries, strengthen our capabilities in software-defined mobility and to enable advanced smart vehicle architecture changes, we acquired Wind River in December 2022. Wind River is a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge for multiple industries, including automotive, by leveraging mixed-criticality software products and solutions enabling customers to develop in the cloud, deploy over the air and run and manage software at the vehicle edge. As described in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained herein, although the timeline has been extended for the broader transition to more fully software-defined vehicles, as evidenced by certain delays in our OEM customers’ software-defined vehicle investment \n57\nTable of Contents\nstrategies, we continue to believe we are well-aligned with long-term key industry technology trends and continue to make investments to further develop and grow our product offerings in this space. \nWe are also continuing to develop market-leading automated driving solutions such as automated driving software, sensing and perception technologies enhanced through artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as the underlying architecture technologies capable of supporting safety-critical applications. We believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will help to support sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies.\nIn March 2020, we completed a transaction with Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”) to form Motional, AD LLC (“Motional”), a joint venture focused on the design, development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies. Although we believe our strategic partnerships have us well-aligned with industry technology mega-trends in these evolving areas, the timeline necessary to produce commercially viable autonomous vehicles has been extended and is still subject to significant uncertainty, which resulted in additional funding requirements for Motional.\nIn April 2024, Aptiv and Hyundai entered into an agreement to restructure Aptiv’s ownership interest in Motional and for Hyundai to provide additional funding to Motional, which also eliminated any requirements for additional future funding from Aptiv. These transactions, which were completed in May 2024, resulted in the reduction of our common equity interest in Motional from 50% as of December 31, 2023 to approximately 15%. In May 2025, Hyundai provided additional funding to Motional, further reducing Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional from 15% as of March 31, 2025 to approximately 13%. Refer to Note 21. Investments in Affiliates to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for further information on these transactions.\nThere are many risks associated with these evolving areas, including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies, the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies, increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and evolving regulations, such as the guidance for automated driving systems published by the U.S. Department of Transportation. While we believe we are well-positioned in these markets, the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us or our partners and ultimately there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to develop these technologies.\nKey growth markets\n. We believe our strong global presence has positioned us to generate strong growth rates over the long-term. We continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets, positioning us to benefit from the expected long-term growth opportunities in these regions. We are capitalizing on our long-standing relationships with the global OEMs and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market OEMs to continue expanding our worldwide leadership. We continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fast-growing automotive markets. We believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets.\nWe have a strong local presence in China, including a major manufacturing base and well-established customer relationships. Each of our business segments have operations and sales in China. There have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the level of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced. Automotive production in China experienced growth of 4% in 2024, which follows growth of 10% in 2023. Despite the market volatility and moderation in the level of economic growth in China, rising income levels in China and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long-term. \nOur business in China remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in China and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the Chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China. Our business in China may also be impacted by the expanding market share of domestic Chinese OEMs in the China market, which has led to declines in revenue and market share of non-Chinese OEMs, resulting in certain traditional OEMs taking steps to reduce or restructure their operations in China. However, we continue to believe this market will benefit from long-term demand for new vehicles and stringent governmental regulation driving increased vehicle content, including accelerated demand for electrified vehicles.\nMarket driven products\n. Our product offerings satisfy the OEMs’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the mega-trends of Safe, Green and Connected, leading to increased content per vehicle, greater profitability and higher margins. With these offerings, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety, electrification, high speed data, connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies. We are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content, software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate, such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies, electrical vehicle monitoring, active safety systems, lane departure warning systems, integrated vehicle cockpit displays, navigation systems and technologies that enable connected \n58\nTable of Contents\ninfotainment in vehicles. Our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution and/or consumption is key to satisfying the OEMs’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology. While we have identified high voltage electrification systems as a key product market, certain of our OEM customers have recently announced delays in their electric vehicle investment strategies amidst reduced expectations for future consumer demand for these products. \nGlobal capabilities and risks\n. Many OEMs are continuing to develop vehicle platforms intended to increase standardization, reduce per-unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. In addition, geopolitical tensions are also forcing them to regionalize their supply chain. As a result, OEMs prefer suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a global basis with manufacturing and design flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend. Our global manufacturing footprint enables us to efficiently manufacture in and supply from best cost countries at scale. Our regional teams allow us to stay connected to local market requirements and more closely partner with our customers during all phases of the development process, from design through production, while maintaining focus on increasing efficiency and lowering costs. Increasing manufacturing automation, footprint rotation to best cost countries, and other operational initiatives have supported our commitment to continuous improvement, leveraging scale and enhancing efficiency to improve our margins. \nOur operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business globally, including military conflicts in regions in which we operate, changes in laws or regulations governing labor, trade, or other monetary or tax fiscal policy changes, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) Pillar Two Framework (the “Framework”), tariffs, quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions or trade barriers. \nExisting free trade laws and regulations, such as the USMCA, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, taxes or non-tariff barriers on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, beginning on April 2, 2025, the U.S. government announced tariffs of at least 10% across imported goods from all countries, with rates even higher for goods from certain countries with a high trade deficit with the U.S. Subsequent to this announcement, a number of other countries announced tariffs on U.S. goods and have negotiated or continue to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. \nWhile the impacts to the Company resulting from these incremental tariffs were not significant during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the future impact of any announced tariffs is subject to a number of factors, including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, changes in the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs in the future, any retaliatory responses to such actions that the target countries may take and any mitigating actions that may become available. In addition, we are continuing to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these incremental tariffs on our results of operations. Despite recent trade negotiations and the potential for trade agreements between the U.S. and the Mexican, Canadian and Chinese governments, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs and any associated retaliatory measures, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S., Mexico, Canada, China or other countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. Management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to identify, quantify and assess proposed or threatened duties, taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, effective January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, the government of Mexico implemented country-wide statutory minimum wage increases of 20% and 12%, respectively. The government of Mexico has also indicated it may implement other labor reforms, such as an initiative to shorten the work week from 48 to 40 hours. While management has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of these labor reforms on our cost structure, we cannot predict the ultimate future impact on our business.\nThe outbreak of armed conflicts in the Middle East beginning in October 2023 has also created numerous uncertainties, including the risk that the conflicts spread throughout the broader region, and their impact on the global economy and supply chains. In addition, as described above, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia has also created numerous economic uncertainties, including the potential for further sanctions against Russia, the impact on the global supply chain for raw materials produced in each country, as well as increased logistics costs and transit times, and the actions of automotive OEMs and suppliers as they relate to production plans in each country and within the region. We are also subject to risks associated with actions taken by governmental authorities to impose changes in laws or regulations that restrict certain business operations, trade or travel in response to a pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness. The impacts of any of these factors mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n59\nTable of Contents\nProduct development\n. The automotive technology and components industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. To compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry, we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner. With our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities we are well positioned to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for high-technology content in automobiles.\nOEMs are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs. As a result, OEMs prefer suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a global basis with manufacturing and design flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers that can provide fully engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts, such as our Company, are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing from global suppliers.\nEngineering, design and development\n. Our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers. We have a team of approximately 21,200 scientists, engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets, located at 11 major technical centers in China, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Singapore and the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we invested approximately $1.6 billion (which includes approximately $535 million co-investment by customers and government agencies) in research and development, including engineering, to maintain our portfolio of innovative products, and own/hold approximately 11,000 patents and protective rights. We also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry, government agencies and academic institutions. Our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies, which, as noted above, co-invest in new product development, accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs.\nIn the past, suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering, designing and developing automotive component parts, and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes. Recently, we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes. This trend reduces our economic risk.\nPricing.\n Cost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing. Our customer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the periods of production and OEMs have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive OEMs. Our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions. In addition, during recent years, global economies and our industry were subjected to significant inflationary cost pressures, and we continue to face additional potential impacts from the rapidly evolving trade policies and tariff actions. We continue to work with our customers, both through price recoveries and adjustments as well as future pricing adjustments as contracts renew, to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures on our results of operations.\nWe are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle. As a result, approximately 97% of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries. Furthermore, we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of contingent workers, which represented approximately 31% of the hourly workforce as of September 30, 2025. However, we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering, as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on reducing our global overhead costs and on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in Europe and aligning our manufacturing capacity with the current levels of automotive production in each region. As we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure.\nWe have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately $7.7 billion and substantial available liquidity of approximately $4.2 billion as of September 30, 2025, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our Revolving Credit Facility and committed European accounts receivable factoring facility, and no significant U.S. defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employer-paid postretirement basic life insurance benefits (“OPEB”) liabilities. We intend to maintain strong financial discipline by targeting industry-leading earnings growth, cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle.\n60\nTable of Contents\nOEM product recalls\n. The number of vehicles recalled globally by OEMs has increased above historical levels. These recalls can either be initiated by the OEMs or influenced by regulatory agencies. Although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues, as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions, the level of recalls outside of the U.S. may also increase. Given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry, including increased focus from regulators and consumers, we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues.\nEfficient use of capital\n. The global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs. Lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years. Substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs.\nIndustry consolidation and disruptive new entrants.\n Consolidation among worldwide OEMs and suppliers is expected to continue as these companies seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies, acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships. Additionally, the rise of advanced software and technologies in vehicles has attracted new and disruptive entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. These entrants may seek to gain access to certain vehicle technology and component markets. Any of these new competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance, which could adversely affect the future growth of the Company. We believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of these trends.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nAptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in OEM production schedules, vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business (which we refer to collectively as volume), increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs (which we refer to as commodity pass-through), fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which we refer to as “FX”), contractual reductions of the sales price to the OEM (which we refer to as contractual price reductions) and engineering changes. Changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue. Such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth, shifts in OEM sales demand, as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration. For instance, a shift in sales demand favoring a particular OEM’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue. A shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions, which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue.\nWe typically experience (as described below) fluctuations in operating (loss) income due to:\n•\nVolume, net of contractual price reductions—changes in volume offset by contractual price reductions (which typically range from 1% to 3% of net sales) and changes in mix;\n•\nOperational performance—changes to costs for materials and commodities or manufacturing and engineering variances; and\n•\nOther—including restructuring costs and any remaining variances not included in Volume, net of contractual price reductions or Operational performance.\nThe automotive technology and component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. For instance, the industry has recently been subjected to increased pricing pressures, specifically in relation to copper and petroleum-based resin products, which have experienced significant volatility in price. We have also been impacted globally by increased overall inflation as a result of a variety of global trends. For example, the rapidly evolving trade policies and tariff actions could result in increased pricing pressures on our global supply chain, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, we expect semiconductor supply cost and commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on future earnings and/or operating cash flows. Management continues to seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures using a number of approaches, including combining purchase requirements with customers and/or other suppliers, using alternate suppliers or product designs, negotiating cost reductions and/or commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging. We have also negotiated, and will continue to negotiate, price increases with our customers in response to the aforementioned increased overall inflation and global supply chain disruptions.\n61\nTable of Contents\nThree and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 versus Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n \n2024\n \nFavorable/(unfavorable)\n2025\n \n2024\n \nFavorable/(unfavorable)\n \n(dollars in millions)\nNet sales\n$\n5,212 \n$\n4,854 \n$\n358 \n$\n15,245 \n$\n14,806 \n$\n439 \nCost of sales\n4,194 \n3,951 \n(243)\n12,310 \n12,057 \n(253)\nGross margin\n1,018 \n19.5%\n903 \n18.6%\n115 \n2,935 \n19.3%\n2,749 \n18.6%\n186 \nSelling, general and administrative\n433 \n331 \n(102)\n1,223 \n1,102 \n(121)\nAmortization\n52 \n53 \n1 \n156 \n159 \n3 \nRestructuring\n60 \n16 \n(44)\n149 \n125 \n(24)\nGoodwill impairment\n648 \n— \n(648)\n648 \n— \n(648)\nOperating (loss) income\n(175)\n503 \n(678)\n759 \n1,363 \n(604)\nInterest expense\n(90)\n(101)\n11 \n(274)\n(230)\n(44)\nOther income, net\n22 \n5 \n17 \n34 \n30 \n4 \nNet gain on equity method transactions\n— \n— \n— \n46 \n641 \n(595)\n(Loss) income before income taxes and equity loss\n(243)\n407 \n(650)\n565 \n1,804 \n(1,239)\nIncome tax expense\n(103)\n(32)\n(71)\n(504)\n(159)\n(345)\n(Loss) income before equity loss\n(346)\n375 \n(721)\n61 \n1,645 \n(1,584)\nEquity loss, net of tax\n(6)\n(7)\n1 \n(27)\n(110)\n83 \nNet (loss) income\n(352)\n368 \n(720)\n34 \n1,535 \n(1,501)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n3 \n7 \n(4)\n9 \n18 \n(9)\nNet loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest\n— \n(2)\n2 \n(2)\n(2)\n— \nNet (loss) income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n(355)\n$\n363 \n$\n(718)\n$\n27 \n$\n1,519 \n$\n(1,492)\nTotal Net Sales\nBelow is a summary of our total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 versus September 30, 2024.\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nVariance Due To:\n \n2025\n2024\nFavorable/(unfavorable)\nVolume, net of contractual price reductions\nFX\nCommodity pass-through\nOther\nTotal\n \n(in millions)\n(in millions)\nTotal net sales\n$\n5,212 \n$\n4,854 \n$\n358 \n$\n285 \n$\n63 \n$\n10 \n$\n— \n$\n358 \nTotal net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased 7% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Our net sales also reflect the impact of contractual price reductions, net of price recoveries, of $22 million, and favorable foreign currency impacts, primarily related to the Euro, partially offset by the Chinese Yuan Renminbi and South Korean Won.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, freight, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, product engineering, design and development expenses, depreciation, warranty costs and other operating expenses. Gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales.\nCost of sales increased $243 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, as summarized below. The Company’s material cost of sales was approximately 50% of net sales for both the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nVariance Due To:\n \n2025\n2024\nFavorable/(unfavorable)\nVolume (a)\nFX\nOperational performance\nOther\nTotal\n \n(dollars in millions)\n(in millions)\nCost of sales\n$\n4,194 \n$\n3,951 \n$\n(243)\n$\n(177)\n$\n(92)\n$\n43 \n$\n(17)\n$\n(243)\nGross margin\n$\n1,018 \n$\n903 \n$\n115 \n$\n108 \n$\n(29)\n$\n43 \n$\n(7)\n$\n115 \nPercentage of net sales\n19.5 \n%\n18.6 \n%\n(a)\nPresented net of contractual price reductions for gross margin variance.\nThe increase in cost of sales reflects the impacts of improved operational performance, offset by increased volumes and currency exchange.

SG&A increased as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to $53 million of separation costs and the absence of a credit loss recovery of approximately $25 million related to a supply relationship in Europe recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. SG&A increased as a percentage of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to $100 million of separation costs and increased incentive compensation costs.\nAmortization\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nFavorable/\n(unfavorable)\n(in millions)\nAmortization\n$\n52 \n$\n53 \n$\n1 \n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nFavorable/\n(unfavorable)\n \n(in millions)\nAmortization\n$\n156 \n$\n159 \n$\n3 \nAmortization expense reflects the non-cash charge related to definite-lived intangible assets.

The charges recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2025 included the recognition of approximately $25 million related to workforce optimization within the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment and approximately $12 million within the Electrical Distribution Systems segment for programs to downsize European manufacturing sites. The charges recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included the recognition of approximately $34 million within the Electrical Distribution Systems segment for programs to downsize and close European manufacturing sites and approximately $15 million for a program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024 focused on global salaried workforce optimization, primarily in the European region. We expect to make cash payments of approximately $135 million over the next twelve months pursuant to currently implemented restructuring programs.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Aptiv recorded employee-related and other restructuring charges totaling approximately $16 million and $125 million, respectively, which reflect programs to align manufacturing capacity with the current levels of automotive production in each region. The charges recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included the recognition of approximately $55 million for a program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2023 focused on global salaried workforce optimization, primarily in the European region. \nWe expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in 2025 and beyond, primarily related to programs focused on reducing global overhead costs, the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in Europe and aligning manufacturing capacity with the levels of automotive production, which includes approximately $40 million (of which approximately $25 million relates to the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, approximately $10 million relates to the Engineering Components Group segment and approximately $5 million relates to the Electrical Distribution Systems segment) for programs approved as of September 30, 2025. Additionally, as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint. The Company plans to implement additional restructuring activities in the future, if necessary, in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels and locations, to improve the efficiency and utilization of other locations and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering. Such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions, customer actions and other factors.\nRefer to Note 7.

The Company’s effective tax rate is also impacted by the receipt of certain tax incentives and holidays that reduce the effective tax rate for certain subsidiaries below the statutory rate.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes net discrete tax expense of approximately $12 million and $253 million, respectively, primarily related to a change in valuation allowance on the Swiss tax incentive, as described below, and the tax impact of legal entity restructuring, partially offset by changes in other valuation allowances and changes in reserves. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 also includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 48 points resulting from the Wind River non-cash goodwill impairment charge, as described further in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained herein, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes net discrete tax benefits of approximately $45 million and $65 million, respectively, primarily related to changes in valuation allowances. Also included as discrete items in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are the beneficial impacts of a business reorganization that occurred in the second quarter of 2024 and approximately 5 points resulting from the Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions, as described further in Note 21. Investment in Affiliates to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. There was no tax expense associated with the gain on the Motional transactions as Aptiv’s interest in Motional is exempt from capital gains tax in the jurisdiction in which it is owned. \nOn December 15, 2022, the E.U. Member States formally adopted the Framework, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the OECD. Many countries have enacted legislation consistent with the Framework effective at the beginning of 2024. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules. The Company has proactively responded to these tax policy changes and will continue to closely monitor developments. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes an unfavorable impact from the enacted Framework.\nOn January 15, 2025, the OECD released Administrative Guidance (the “Guidance) on Article 9.1 of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (the “Model Rules”) which amends the Pillar Two Framework. Jurisdictions that have adopted the Framework may implement and administer their domestic laws consistent with the Model Rules and Guidance. The Guidance eliminates the tax basis in certain deferred tax assets including tax credit carryforwards for purposes of the global minimum tax established under the Framework. As a result, the Company no longer expects to obtain significant benefits from the tax incentive granted to its Swiss subsidiary in 2023. Accordingly, the Company recognized an increase to valuation allowances of $294 million to reduce the related deferred tax asset during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. No other deferred tax assets are impacted by the Guidance. \nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was enacted into law. The Act includes changes to U.S. tax law that will be applicable to Aptiv beginning in 2025, with additional provisions applying in subsequent years. Included in these changes are favorable adjustments to deductions for interest, qualified property, and research and development expenditures, as well as reforms to the international tax framework. The Act will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \nRefer to Note 11.

The decrease in equity losses recognized by Aptiv during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 2024 is primarily attributable to the decrease in Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional from 50% to approximately 13% as a result of the Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions that were completed in May 2024 and May 2025.

Separation of Electrical Distribution Systems to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for additional information, in the first quarter of 2025, Aptiv realigned its business into three reportable operating segments:\n•\nElectrical Distribution Systems, which includes the full range of low voltage and high voltage power, signal and data distribution solutions needed to deliver fully integrated, cost-optimized architectures. As described in Note 22. Separation of Electrical Distribution Systems to the consolidated financial statements contained herein, the Company is pursuing a separation of the Electrical Distribution Systems business into a new, independent publicly traded company, through a transaction expected to be treated as a tax-free spin-off to its shareholders.\n•\nEngineered Components Group, which includes interconnect and component solutions that optimize the distribution of signal, power and data for next-generation applications across multiple end markets.\n•\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience, which includes platforms and modular offerings, such as perception systems, high-performance compute solutions, cloud-native software for ADAS and user experience, and edge-to-cloud DevOps tools.\n•\nEliminations and Other, which includes i) the elimination of inter-segment transactions, and ii) certain other expenses and income of a non-operating or strategic nature.\nPrior period amounts were adjusted retrospectively to reflect the change in reportable operating segments, consistent with the current year presentation, throughout the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss to evaluate segment performance, and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to the segments, as management believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Segment Adjusted Operating Income should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net (loss) income attributable to Aptiv, which is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted Operating Income that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment Adjusted Operating Income, as determined and measured by Aptiv, should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Refer to Note 19.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, our existing cash balance, and as necessary and available, borrowings under credit facilities and issuance of long-term debt and equity. To the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness, strategic acquisitions or investments, additional share repurchases and/or general corporate purposes. We also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion and net debt (defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents) of $6.0 billion. The following table summarizes our available liquidity, which includes cash, cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities, as of September 30, 2025:\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n \n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,640 \nRevolving Credit Facility, unutilized portion (1)\n1,999 \nCommitted European accounts receivable factoring facility, unutilized portion (2)\n527 \nTotal available liquidity\n$\n4,166 \n(1)\nAvailability reduced by $1 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2025.\n(2)\nBased on September 30, 2025 foreign currency rates, subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable.\n71\nTable of Contents\nWe expect existing cash, available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities, including restructuring payments, capital expenditures, debt obligations and separation activities. In addition, we expect to continue early redemption of outstanding debt and repurchases of outstanding ordinary shares pursuant to our authorized ordinary share repurchase program, as further described below.\nWe also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications, subject to current monetary policies. We utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Aptiv. As of September 30, 2025, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.6 billion. If additional non-U.S. cash was needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; however, based on our current liquidity needs and strategies, we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nIn July 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $5.0 billion of ordinary shares, which commenced in August 2024 following completion of the Company’s $2.0 billion January 2019 share repurchase program. This share repurchase program provides for share purchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (which may include derivative transactions, including an accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”)), depending on share price, market conditions and other factors, as determined by the Company.\nAs part of the Company’s share repurchase program, on August 1, 2024, the Company entered into ASR agreements with each of Goldman Sachs International and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to repurchase an aggregate of $3.0 billion of Aptiv’s ordinary shares (the “ASR Agreements”).\nUnder the terms of the ASR Agreements, on August 2, 2024, the Company made an aggregate payment of $3.0 billion (the “Repurchase Price”) and received initial deliveries of approximately 30.8 million ordinary shares with a value of $2.25 billion, which were retired immediately and recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity. Aptiv incurred approximately $4 million of direct costs in connection with the ASR Agreements. Given the Company’s ability to settle in shares, the remaining $750 million prepaid forward contract was classified as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as of December 31, 2024. The Company initially funded the accelerated share repurchase program with cash on hand and borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The Bridge Credit Agreement was subsequently repaid and terminated during the third quarter of 2024 using proceeds from the Term Loan A and issuance of the 2024 Senior Notes and 2024 Junior Notes, as further described in Note 8. Debt. \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, upon final settlements under the ASR Agreements, Aptiv received incremental deliveries of approximately 17.7 million ordinary shares. All shares delivered to Aptiv under the ASR Agreements were retired immediately. Under the ASR Agreements, the Company received total deliveries of approximately 48.5 million ordinary shares at an average price of $61.84 per share, based on the daily volume-weighted average price of our ordinary shares on specified dates during the terms of the ASR Agreements, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the company also repurchased approximately 1.2 million of our outstanding ordinary shares for $96 million in the open market.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in addition to the initial shares received under the ASR program, we repurchased approximately 13.6 million of our outstanding ordinary shares for $1,100 million in the open market.\nAs of September 30, 2025, approximately $2,419 million of share repurchases remained available under the July 2024 share repurchase program. During the period from October 1, 2025 to October 29, 2025, the Company repurchased an additional $44 million worth of shares pursuant to a trading plan with set trading instructions established by the Company. As a result, approximately $2,375 million of share repurchases remain available under the July 2024 share repurchase program. All previously repurchased shares were retired and are reflected as a reduction of ordinary share capital for the par value of the shares, with the excess applied as reductions to additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings.\nDividends from Equity Investments\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, Aptiv received dividends of $3 million from its equity method investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, Aptiv received dividends of $11 million and $10 million, respectively, from its equity method investments. The dividends were recognized as a reduction to the investment and represented a return on investment included in cash flows from operating activities.\n72\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions\nIn April 2025, one of Aptiv’s wholly-owned subsidiaries completed the sale of certain assets (net of certain liabilities) that were previously reported within the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment for net cash proceeds of approximately $4 million. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRefer to Note 17 Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for further detail of the Company’s business acquisitions and divestitures.\nMotional Joint Venture Funding and Ownership Restructuring Transactions\n—On April 19, 2024, Aptiv and Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”) entered into an agreement to restructure Aptiv’s ownership interest in Motional and for Hyundai to provide additional funding to Motional, each as described below. Prior to these transactions, Motional was 50% owned by each of Aptiv and Hyundai. \nAs part of the agreement, on May 2, 2024, Hyundai invested $475 million in Motional in exchange for additional common equity interests. Aptiv did not participate in this funding round. This transaction resulted in the dilution of Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional from 50% to approximately 44%, prior to the completion of any further transactions as described below. As these units were issued at a valuation greater than the carrying value of our investment in Motional, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $91 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAlso as part of the agreement, on May 16, 2024, Aptiv sold 11% of its common equity interest in Motional to Hyundai for approximately $448 million of cash consideration. Aptiv also exchanged approximately 21% of its common equity in Motional for a like number of Motional preferred shares. These transactions resulted in the reduction of Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional from approximately 44% to approximately 15%. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $550 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe total gain recorded as a result of the Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions completed in May 2024, all as described above, was approximately $641 million (approximately $2.50 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOn May 30, 2025, Hyundai invested approximately $440 million in Motional in exchange for additional common equity interests. Aptiv did not participate in this funding round. This transaction resulted in the dilution of Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional from approximately 15% as of March 31, 2025 to approximately 13%. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $33 million (approximately $0.15 per diluted share) during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nInvestment in TTTech Auto AG\n—The shareholders of TTTech Auto entered into an agreement for the sale of 100% of TTTech Auto to an unrelated third party, and as a result, the Company determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment to its equity method investment in TTTech Auto in the fourth quarter of 2024 based on the anticipated acquisition value of TTTech Auto. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s equity investment in TTTech Auto was written down to its estimated fair value of $147 million, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $36 million within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations. The sale of TTTech Auto closed in June 2025, resulting in net cash proceeds to Aptiv of $164 million. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $13 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations, which includes accumulated currency translation adjustment impacts of $6 million. Following completion of the sale, Aptiv no longer holds an equity interest in TTTech Auto and accordingly reduced the carrying value of the investment to zero in the consolidated balance sheet.\nTechnology Investments\n—During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company sold its Valens Semiconductor Ltd. ordinary shares for net proceeds of approximately $6 million and its Smart Eye AB ordinary shares for net proceeds of approximately $6 million.\nIn April 2025, the Company’s Advanced Safety and User Experience segment made an investment of approximately 42 billion Korean Won (“KRW”) (approximately $29 million, using foreign currency rates on the investment date) in convertible redeemable preferred shares of StradVision, Inc. (“StradVision”), a provider of deep learning-based camera perception software for automotive applications. The Company previously made KRW-denominated investments in StradVision totaling approximately $11 million in the first quarter of 2025 and approximately $108 million in prior years (using foreign currency rates on the date of the respective investments). Due to the Company’s redemption rights, the Company’s investment in StradVision is classified as an available-for-sale debt security within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. In October 2025, the Company’s existing preferred shares \n73\nTable of Contents\nin StradVision were converted to common shares. Following this conversion, Aptiv began accounting for its investment in StradVision under the equity method.\nIn September 2024, the Company’s Advanced Safety and User Experience segment made an investment totaling approximately 399 million RMB (approximately $57 million, using foreign currency rates on the investment date) in preferred equity of MAXIEYE Automotive Technology (Ningbo) Co., Ltd (“Maxieye”), a provider of advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving applications. Due to the Company’s redemption rights, the Company’s investment in Maxieye is classified as an available-for-sale debt security within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company also agreed to invest an additional 171 million RMB (approximately $24 million, using September 30, 2025 foreign currency rates) in preferred equity of Maxieye, contingent on the achievement of certain technical milestones, which have not yet been met as of September 30, 2025, and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \nRefer to Note 21. Investments in Affiliates to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for further detail of the Company’s investments.\nCredit Agreement\nAptiv PLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Aptiv LLC (formerly known as Aptiv Corporation) and Aptiv Global Financing Designated Activity Company (“AGF DAC”) entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with, among others, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), under which it maintains a senior unsecured credit facility currently consisting of a revolving credit facility of $2 billion (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). AGF DAC and Aptiv LLC are each borrowers under the Credit Agreement, under which such borrowings would be guaranteed by each of the other borrowers, Aptiv PLC and Aptiv Swiss Holdings. \nThe Credit Agreement was entered into in March 2011 and has been subsequently amended and restated on several occasions, most recently on March 31, 2025 (the “March 2025 amendment”). The March 2025 amendment, among other things, (1) refinanced and replaced the revolver with a new five-year revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $2 billion, and (2) removed provisions from the June 2021 amendment for sustainability-linked rate adjustments. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2030. The Credit Agreement also contains an uncommitted accordion feature that permits Aptiv to increase, from time to time, on customary terms and conditions, the aggregate borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $1 billion upon Aptiv’s request, the agreement of the lenders participating in the increase, and the approval of the Administrative Agent. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are revolving in nature and may be made and prepaid from time to time at Aptiv’s option without premium or penalty, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. The March 2025 amendment also required that Aptiv pay amendment fees of $5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which are reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs of September 30, 2025, Aptiv had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $1 million in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Agreement. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. No amounts were drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at Aptiv’s option, at either (a) the Administrative Agent’s Alternate Base Rate (“ABR” as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (b) SOFR plus in either case a percentage per annum as set forth in the table below (the “Applicable Rate”). The rates under the Credit Agreement on the specified dates are set forth below:\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nSOFR plus\nABR plus\nSOFR plus\nABR plus\nRevolving Credit Facility\n1.125 \n%\n0.125 \n%\n1.06 \n%\n0.06 \n%\nThe Applicable Rate under the Credit Agreement, as well as the facility fee, may increase or decrease from time to time based on changes in the Company’s credit ratings. Accordingly, the interest rate is subject to fluctuation during the term of the Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, SOFR and changes in the Company’s corporate credit ratings. The Credit Agreement also requires that Aptiv pay certain facility fees on the Revolving Credit Facility, which are also subject to adjustment based on certain letter of credit issuance and fronting fees. \nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company’s (and the Company’s subsidiaries’) ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or liens or to dispose of substantially all of its assets. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement).\n74\nTable of Contents\nThe Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants as of September 30, 2025.\nTerm Loan A Credit Agreement\nOn August 19, 2024, Aptiv PLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries AGF DAC and Aptiv LLC entered into a senior unsecured term loan A credit agreement (the “Term Loan A Credit Agreement”) with, among others, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, under which it maintained a senior unsecured credit facility consisting of a term loan (the “Term Loan A”) in aggregate principal amount of $600 million. Aptiv incurred approximately $2 million of issuance costs in connection with the Term Loan A.\nAs described above, proceeds from the Term Loan A were used to repay a portion of the loans incurred under the Bridge Credit Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This transaction was accounted for as a modification of debt in accordance with ASC Topic 470-50, \nDebt Modifications and Extinguishments\n. Accordingly, a pro-rata portion of the unamortized fees from the Bridge Credit Agreement in the amount of $4 million was transferred to the Term Loan A and, together with the $2 million of direct issuance costs referenced above, were amortized to interest expense over the term of the Term Loan A. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $350 million of the outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan A, utilizing cash on hand. During the first quarter of 2025, the Company fully repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance of $250 million on the Term Loan A utilizing cash on hand, and recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 within other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Term Loan A had a maturity date of August 19, 2027. Prior to its repayment, borrowings under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement were prepayable at Aptiv’s option without premium or penalty. No principal payment was required until the maturity date.\nLoans under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement bore interest, at Aptiv’s option, at either (a) ABR or (b) SOFR plus in either case a percentage per annum as set forth in the table below (the “Term Loan Applicable Rate”). The rates under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement on the specified dates are set forth below:\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nSOFR plus\nABR plus\nSOFR plus\nABR plus\nTerm Loan A\nN/A\nN/A\n1.250 \n%\n0.250 \n%\nSenior and Junior Unsecured Notes\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Company had the following senior and junior unsecured notes issued and outstanding:\nAggregate Principal Amount\n(in millions)\nStated Coupon Rate\nIssuance Date\nMaturity Date\nInterest Payment Date\n$\n585 \n1.60%\nSeptember 2016\nSeptember 2028\nSeptember 15\n$\n282 \n4.35%\nMarch 2019\nMarch 2029\nMarch 15 and September 15\n$\n507 \n4.65%\nSeptember 2024\nSeptember 2029\nMarch 13 and September 13\n$\n734 \n3.25%\nFebruary 2022\nMarch 2032\nMarch 1 and September 1\n$\n529 \n5.15%\nSeptember 2024\nSeptember 2034\nMarch 13 and September 13\n$\n877 \n4.25%\nJune 2024\nJune 2036\nJune 11\n$\n300 \n4.40%\nSeptember 2016\nOctober 2046\nApril 1 and October 1\n$\n350 \n5.40%\nMarch 2019\nMarch 2049\nMarch 15 and September 15\n$\n1,500 \n3.10%\nNovember 2021\nDecember 2051\nJune 1 and December 1\n$\n1,000 \n4.15%\nFebruary 2022\nMay 2052\nMay 1 and November 1\n$\n550 \n5.75%\nSeptember 2024\nSeptember 2054\nMarch 13 and September 13\n$\n500 \n6.875% (1)\nSeptember 2024\nDecember 2054\nJune 15 and December 15\n(1)\nRepresents fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated unsecured notes.\n75\nTable of Contents\nIn September 2025, Aptiv redeemed $148 million aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes for cash consideration of $145 million, and recognized a net gain on debt extinguishment of approximately $3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 within other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. During the period from October 1, 2025 to October 29, 2025, the Company redeemed for cash $31 million aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes pursuant to a trading plan with set trading instructions established by the Company.\nAlthough the specific terms of each indenture governing each series of senior and junior notes vary, the senior indentures contain certain restrictive covenants, including with respect to Aptiv’s (and Aptiv’s subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge with or into other entities. As of September 30, 2025, the Company was in compliance with the provisions of all series of the outstanding senior and junior notes. Refer to Note 8. Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for additional information.\nGuarantor Summarized Financial Information\nAs further described in Note 8. Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained herein, Aptiv LLC and AGF DAC are each borrowers under the Credit Agreement, under which such borrowings would be guaranteed by each of the other borrowers, Aptiv PLC and Aptiv Swiss Holdings. Old Aptiv issued the 2016 Euro-denominated Senior Notes, 2016 Senior Notes, 2019 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. In February 2022, Aptiv LLC and AGF DAC were added as guarantors on each series of outstanding senior notes previously issued by Old Aptiv. AGF DAC was added as a joint and several co-issuer of the 2021 Senior Notes in December 2021, effective as of the date of issuance. Old Aptiv and Aptiv LLC jointly issued the 2022 Senior Notes, which are guaranteed by AGF DAC. In 2024, Old Aptiv and AGF DAC co-issued the 2024 Euro-denominated Senior Notes, the 2024 Senior Notes, and the 2024 Junior Notes, which are all guaranteed by Aptiv LLC. In December 2024, in connection with the merger of Old Aptiv with and into Aptiv Swiss Holdings, with respect to each series of outstanding senior and junior notes previously issued by Old Aptiv, Aptiv Swiss Holdings succeeded to Old Aptiv as obligor, and Aptiv PLC was added as a guarantor. Together, Aptiv PLC, Aptiv LLC, AGF DAC and Aptiv Swiss Holdings comprise the “Obligor Group.” All other consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries of Aptiv PLC are not subject to any guarantee under any series of notes outstanding (the “Non-Guarantors”). The guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to any of their existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of each of their existing and future subsidiaries that is not a guarantor.\nThe below summarized financial information is presented on a combined basis after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group and equity in earnings from and investments in the Non-Guarantors. The below summarized financial information should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained herein, as the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities.\n76\nTable of Contents\nObligor Group\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\n(in millions)\nNet sales\n$\n— \nGross margin\n$\n— \nOperating loss\n$\n(136)\nNet loss\n$\n(274)\nNet loss attributable to Aptiv\n$\n(274)\nAs of September 30, 2025:\nCurrent assets (1)\n$\n7,662 \nLong-term assets (1)\n$\n790 \nCurrent liabilities (2)\n$\n6,155 \nLong-term liabilities (2)\n$\n7,848 \nNoncontrolling interest\n$\n— \nAs of December 31, 2024:\nCurrent assets (1)\n$\n6,969 \nLong-term assets (1)\n$\n692 \nCurrent liabilities (2)\n$\n5,683 \nLong-term liabilities (2)\n$\n8,126 \nNoncontrolling interest\n$\n— \n(1)\nIncludes current assets of $6,688 million and $6,212 million, and long-term assets of $767 million and $687 million, due from Non-Guarantors as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes current liabilities of $6,073 million and $5,481 million, and long-term liabilities of $226 million and $226 million, due to Non-Guarantors as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nOther Financing\nReceivable factoring\n—Aptiv maintains a €450 million European accounts receivable factoring facility that is available on a committed basis and allows for factoring of receivables denominated in both Euros and U.S. dollars (“USD”). This facility is accounted for as short-term debt and borrowings are subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable. Collateral is not required related to these trade accounts receivable. This facility became effective on January 1, 2021 and had an initial term of three years, and was renewed for an additional three-year term, effective November 2023, subject to Aptiv’s right to terminate at any time with three months’ notice. After expiration of the new three-year term, either party can terminate with three months’ notice. Borrowings denominated in Euros under the facility bear interest at the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus 0.50% and USD borrowings bear interest at two-month SOFR plus 0.68%, with borrowings under either denomination carrying a minimum interest rate of 0.20%.

Due to this cycle of cash flows, we may utilize short-term financing, including our Revolving Credit Facility and European accounts receivable factoring facility, to manage our intra-month working capital needs. Our cash balance typically peaks at month end.\n77\nTable of Contents\nWe utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan structures and other distributions and advances, to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. We utilize a global cash pooling arrangement to consolidate and manage our global cash balances, which enables us to efficiently move cash into and out of a number of the countries in which we operate.\nOperating activities\n—Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,367 million and $1,386 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
